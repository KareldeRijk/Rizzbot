In today's video, we explore six unattractive habits that can undermine your confidence in conversations and suggest alternative behaviors to command respect. The first habit is avoidant body language, which includes actions like hanging your head, avoiding eye contact, or turning away from the person you’re speaking to. Such body language can hinder connection, as illustrated by a nervous character on a first date. Instead, adopting strong body language—keeping your head up, making eye contact, smiling, and taking up space—can significantly enhance your first impression and convey confidence. A helpful mental cue is to "open and expand," which encourages more open and expansive body language.

The second habit is talking tentatively, often characterized by filler words and stuttering. For instance, Kristen Stewart's earlier interviews displayed this tendency, but with practice, she learned to pause and think before responding, which made her more engaging. Embracing silence can build anticipation and make your responses more impactful.

Next, we discuss leaning into embarrassment, which can minimize its impact and enhance your confidence. Instead of trying to hide awkward moments, embracing them with humor—like Margot Robbie does—can draw people in and make you more relatable. This concept extends to pacing and leading in conversations, where acknowledging awkwardness can make you more charismatic.

The fourth point emphasizes treating others with respect, which can boost your own confidence. This involves being authentic and transparent about your feelings, as seen in examples from various celebrities who acknowledge their nervousness openly, thus making their interactions more genuine and relatable.

Fifth, we highlight the importance of appearance and body language in projecting confidence. Dressing well and maintaining a strong posture can significantly influence how others perceive you. Additionally, using pauses effectively during conversations can enhance your storytelling and keep your audience engaged.

Lastly, we explore how to build confidence through gradual exposure to social situations. By reframing rejection as an opportunity for growth and focusing on authenticity rather than perfection, you can cultivate a more confident demeanor. This involves embracing your imperfections and being honest about your feelings, which not only makes you more relatable but also reinforces your self-acceptance.

In conclusion, by replacing avoidant behaviors with open body language, embracing pauses, leaning into embarrassment, and prioritizing authenticity, you can significantly improve your conversational confidence and command respect from others.

The phenomenon of buying stocks like GameStop after they have already skyrocketed—often by 100 times—can be attributed to psychological factors such as recency bias and scarcity. Investors, influenced by the stock's recent performance, may believe that the upward trend will continue. However, the more significant driver is the fear of missing out (FOMO), which leads individuals to buy at inflated prices, driven by the belief that they are seizing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Scarcity, as a psychological trigger, compels people to act quickly, often ignoring the fundamental value of the asset.

The dramatic rise and subsequent fall of GameStop stock illustrate this phenomenon. On January 28, 2021, the stock surged to $480, only to plummet when brokerage firms restricted buying while allowing selling. This created a chaotic environment where panic selling ensued, leading to substantial losses for many investors. The situation resembled a modified prisoner's dilemma: shareholders faced a choice to hold or sell, with the risk that if they sold, others would follow, causing the price to collapse.

The lack of transparency within the GameStop community exacerbated the issue. While many posts on forums like WallStreetBets advocated for holding the stock, silent selling occurred, leading to uncertainty about the cause of the price drop—whether it was due to hedge fund actions or individual investors. Unlike tightly-knit communities that enforce accountability, GameStop investors could publicly declare their intentions without facing repercussions for changing their minds.

Prominent figures, such as Dave Portnoy, exemplified this behavior, promoting the idea of holding the stock while quietly selling their shares. This discrepancy between words and actions highlights the importance of evaluating an individual's commitment based on their investments rather than their public statements. For example, while Elon Musk and Mark Cuban expressed support for GameStop investors, their actual financial involvement was questionable.

The broader implications of this situation reveal the complexities of market psychology and the role of community dynamics in investment decisions. The GameStop saga serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of succumbing to psychological pressures in trading, particularly in the absence of reliable information and accountability. Investors should remain vigilant, recognizing the potential for manipulation and the importance of thorough research before making decisions based solely on trends or social media influences.

In summary, the allure of stocks like GameStop, driven by recency bias and scarcity, can lead to irrational investment behaviors. The subsequent volatility and losses underscore the need for transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making in trading, emphasizing that understanding market psychology is crucial for navigating the complexities of investing.

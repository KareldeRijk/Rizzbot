      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Very few people can control a conversation better than a comedian. Right. What we've got here is a person who's under mistaken belief that they're funny. Comedians have arsenals of jokes that put rude people in their place and redirect the flow of conversation. Even when there isn't a conflict, when a joke lands and everybody laughs, there's that period of space where you can lead the conversation wherever you like. So in this video, we're going to look at three specific types of jokes that Russell Brand uses to masterfully control a confrontation on MSNBC. We're also going to see how you can use these same jokes to confidently steer conversations in your own life. And FYI, this is actually part two of a series since the first video I did on this topic ran long. So the first type of joke is best used to diffuse tense situations before they get out of hand. It also generally makes any situation funnier so it's the most widely applicable and it's unpointed wit. This is a popular style, for instance, with Conan O'Brien. I have the legs, the legs of an NBA center, and I have the torso of a little girl. And you know what? She's not even a healthy little girl. She was born in the 1840s, her name's Molly, and she has rickets. Now, I say unpointed because you're not using this wit like Winston Churchill did to destroy someone. In his case, when Nancy Astor told him, if I were your wife, I would poison your coffee, he replied, and if I were your husband, I'd drink it. Now, that is very witty but pointed jokes like that escalate tension — they don't diffuse it. So instead, we're going to be replying with a type of wit that gets a chuckle not at someone's expense so that they actually cool off. And there are tons of ways to be witty but the easiest is with your word choice by being hyper-specific. Watch how Russell chooses odd words that make it hard not to smirk. I hope that I'm here as a fully qualified professional gentleman. None of us are. Free from mental illness. Free from it. Tweeting right now. Tweeting themselves senseless back there. Yeah. Lovely. That's to create the atmosphere of, we're a hotbed of news. It's a working news. Yeah. He also uses less common words for the same effect. None of you. This is a hotbed of neurosis and psychosis. Oh, my word. I'm grateful to be here. You are talking about me as if I'm not here and as if I'm an extraterrestrial. Following Russell's lead, you can simply choose more uncommon words — extraterrestrial instead of alien, neurotic instead of crazy, and the end result is that people smirk and it breaks the tension that might be mounting. It's also a generally good idea for being funnier in any situation. The second type of joke is best used when you are forced to discuss a topic that you would rather not. Maybe someone is bringing up an insecurity or just being plain rude. In those cases, you want to redirect things without calling the other person out directly and that's where purposeful misinterpretation comes in huge. For instance, when the host demands that Russell show him part of his stand-up routine, Russell doesn't want to. He says no. Can we get like, you know, 30 seconds now? Well, not really, love. But when the hosts persist, Russell uses purposeful misinterpretation to take control of the conversation and move on. I mean, this is how it works. Gandhi go. I hope that's not your message to Gandhi and the people of India. Misinterpretation can also be seen when you shift the focus of what is most obvious in any situation to something that is far less obvious. You see it again in another clip that we touched on in part 1 and it's worth calling out here so you can see it in action. In this case, members of the Westboro Baptist Church made a very offensive poster that was a gift for Russell. And rather than focusing immediately on the poster's obviously upsetting contents, Russell shifted his focus to something minor — taking back control of the frame and the conversation. That's not a very flattering photograph. That's the face you made. You made the face. I made the face. I pays the price. Fair enough. That's true. So remember, in any situation, even when someone is being insulting, you have control over what aspect of their speech you respond to. You can actually control the frame. And if you choose not to focus on the obvious piece and instead purposely misinterpret their intent, perhaps focusing on a minor detail or reading it as a compliment, you upset expectations which then gets a laugh and allows you to retake control. And in this case, Tyrion Lannister had it nailed. How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin? In my own bed at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my c**k. So if you find yourself in a situation where someone is being sarcastic or trying to put you down by saying something like, nice job or geez, you really killed that one, you can make the group laugh and take back control of the conversation by simply taking the comment at face value. So you might reply, thanks, I appreciate you noticing. This shows that even if you've made a mistake, you are still unfazed by it and in control of the situation. Now, if things get a bit more dicey, you have another option and this is sarcasm. Sarcasm in this context is when the literal words that you are saying don't match the implied meaning. And it's a way of saying something nice on the surface with less than kind undertones so it's not as harsh as a direct insult but it's still likely to make an impact on the other person. We're just sort of admiring the whole, you know, it's the whole thing, isn't it? Well, thank you for your casual objectification. I've warned against sarcasm in the past because it's generally easy to upset people even when you might not mean to and usually, all the British people hate me in the comments for that advice because it's like a second language over there. So let's just say that this advice for avoiding sarcasm with people you don't know well generally holds true inside of the United States but it does have its place in dealing with rude people. So if you use it, you might want to just consider softening it with a smile like Russell does. Is this what you all do for a living? These people, I'm sure, are typically very, very good at their job. You're conveying news to the people of America. People of America, we're going to be okay. Everything's all right. Either way, this type of joke is usually much more effective for winning an audience over than it is for making the person you're talking to actually like you so use it sparingly and ideally with a cheeky grin. For instance, if someone is being rude to you, you could say, wow, so glad that we're getting the opportunity to hang out. That usually will make them stop in their tracks. A hugely important part of being quick on your feet like that is the ability to stay calm under pressure and a fantastic tool for getting there is meditation and that is why I have asked Simple Habit to sponsor this video and give you a free week of guided meditations on their app. Now Simple Habit has tons of different guided meditations and I personally really enjoy the ones around cultivating more joy and gratitude and I enjoy them so much that I actually created one specifically for our viewers that is designed to tap into a deep sense of confidence and charisma before you have to head out to a situation where you're likely to feel pressure so you know that you will be on and if you want to check out that meditation, the one that I created, and all of the others for free for seven days, you can do so by tapping the link in the description and if you do that on your phone, it's going to work better since this is an app. If you decide that you like the meditations and you want to build a routine and a habit of listening to one which is a great way to begin your day, you can continue with Simple Habit for just $11.99 a month and that includes all of their meditations. Either way, the free trial gives you a chance to test it out, see if it's for you before you have to make a decision so it's worth taking for a spin. Thank you guys for watching. I hope that you have enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 439}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Ellen DeGeneres has been getting a lot of hate on the internet recently. This video isn't meant to be a commentary on her one way or the other but after seeing those hate videos, we thought you'd like to know the common types of jokes that make people dislike you and some of the jokes you can make instead that will make people like you. The first type of joke that will make someone dislike you is sharing their sensitive information to get a laugh. For example, watch Taylor Swift's reaction after Ellen tries to get her to say who the song We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together is about. You're supposed to ring one... But I don't want to. I don't want to. I'll ring... Because they'll send me angry emails and I don't want to get them. I'll hold it for you. Now, not everyone is uncomfortable talking about their exes so this isn't immediately a bad idea for a gag but Taylor is obviously uncomfortable with it. Despite this, Ellen plows ahead to try to get a laugh. What are you doing to me? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Alright, alright. This makes me feel so bad about myself. In this scenario, it's pretty obvious early on that Taylor wants Ellen to stop but normally, you won't get such clear feedback. So there are two signs of discomfort you should look out for if you're going to make jokes about potentially sensitive areas of someone else's life. If you see these signs, it's time to pull back and pivot topics. The first sign you want to look for is verbal hesitation. Check out this clip of Ariana Grande and notice how she repeatedly cuts herself off mid-sentence. Let's talk about your love life, can we? Oh, my God. Do you mind? Oh, God. I do. I don't know, man. This is so crazy. The second sign is that Ariana shows shrinking and self-soothing body language. First, hugging herself then covering and touching various parts of her face. He was a dancer — no, he's a rapper. He was with you. We performed together on your show. We were babies. Body language like that is a clear cue to pull back and pivot to a different topic but instead, Ellen plows ahead so she can tell her joke and while the audience laughs, notice Ariana does not. I asked you something about him and you said, So, you know, I'm his homie and now he's living in your homie. There's that. Right. It seems like Ellen wanted to tell that joke no matter how Ariana reacted and maybe as a talk show host, that's okay but in your life, if you plow through these signs of discomfort, you'll end up hurting your relationship with the person you're talking about even if you get a laugh from other people. In this next clip, take note of Cara Delevingne's self-soothing body language as Graham Norton starts to share a potentially sensitive sex story of hers. I think your embarrassment threshold is quite high. What? Well, and we're talking backstage. No, we're talking backstage. We're talking about having sex on a plane. Clearly, Graham thinks this is a funny story and wants to share it with the audience and maybe he thinks that since Cara shared it with him, she won't mind him telling it and that's all good. There's no harm in bringing it up but when you see these early signs of discomfort in your own life like breaking eye contact and self-soothing neck or face touches, that's your cue to change topics. Don't continue to force the issue like Graham does. So you were having sex on a plane and someone was watching you? Yeah. What? Um... The pilot? No. If you notice someone nervously touching their face or suddenly closing off their body, take it upon yourself to stop and redirect the conversation. One great way to do this is to turn the joke back on yourself. For example, watch this awkward clip of Ellen trying to out Mariah Carey as pregnant by showing she won't drink alcohol. The other thing is that people are saying that you're pregnant. There's rumors... Don't discuss that. You want to taste it? I can't believe you did this to me, Ellen. What? I'm not going to ask you if you're pregnant. This is peer pressure. You see what Ellen is doing? This is peer pressure. Right then if Ellen had realized Mariah wasn't comfortable sharing and said something like, Oh, you don't want to drink? Great! That means two for me. It would have gotten the laugh she wanted from the audience plus a laugh from Mariah and then she could have segued into Mariah's upcoming album. Mariah would have appreciated Ellen in that moment for taking the pressure off of her and inviting her to talk about something she actually wants to discuss. When telling jokes, you should aim to make the other person feel good. Any negative emotion they experience will be linked back to you. This is the second mistake people sometimes make — making jokes designed to make the other person feel guilty. For example, in this clip, you'll see Ellen attempt to jokingly make Dakota Johnson feel guilty for not inviting her to a party. It does not go over well. How was the party? I wasn't invited. Actually, no, that's not the truth, Ellen. You were invited. No, last time I was on the show, last year, you gave me a bunch of s*** about not inviting you but I didn't even know you wanted to be invited. Well, who doesn't want to be invited to a party? I didn't even know you liked me. Of course I like you. But I did invite you and you didn't come. This is a surprisingly common joke that most people make when they're hurt or don't know how to communicate their frustration. But ironically, all you do with this joke is make the person want to spend less time with you than they already do. Ellen continues the joke after Dakota Johnson's co-star, Zach, mentions how great of a friend Dakota is. From Dakota's expression, you can see she's not enjoying this style of humor. That's good to hear. She's not a good friend of mine but she's a good friend to you and that's what matters. For another example, here's Jimmy Fallon trying the same joke with Robert Downey Jr. Crazy blowout from what I read. I guess my invitation lost in the mail. But you know how it is. You know where I am pretty much every night. It's no big deal. You can tell from Robert's face he does not love the joke and instead of responding with something apologetic, he fires back with a burn. You had a lot of people. There are probably over 30 people over there, right? Yeah. What's 31, you know? Yeah, you weren't invited. These jokes often become habits which is why you want to be careful. You say them unthinkingly and then they backfire. If you catch yourself making jokes like this, your best bet is to change them out for jokes that make the other person feel good. The examples in this video aren't the norm for Ellen. She's actually quite good at making jokes that pretend to be teasing but are really meant to elevate the other person like here with Amy Adams. You're an amazing actress. You're not one but two nominated films tonight you are in. That is so... What is the word for it? Selfish, I guess. If you want help learning how to build this positive habit, you can check out our other video on Ellen which we'll link to in the description. That said, not every joke has to be a compliment in order to be well-received. There's nothing inherently wrong with teasing. In fact, this is how some of the closest friends interact with each other. But one situation that will often get you in trouble is when you're teasing someone of lower status than you. For a solid example of how social status affects the reception of your jokes, check out these two clips. The first clip is Jimmy Kimmel, a famous TV show host, poking fun at Markiplier and Mrs. May, two YouTubers who he doesn't know very well and who are, by contrast, less famous than him. Markiplier, in particular, doesn't seem to like it. It's likely Markiplier felt Jimmy was coming from a mean place and mocking him. Contrast that with this clip of Sofia Vergara effectively making the same joke saying her husband has a nerdy personality. Sofia can get away with calling her husband a nerd because they have a close relationship and because Joe is an incredibly handsome movie star. She's very unlikely to feel sensitive about this or take offense. And as overkill, she even makes sure to compliment him each time before calling him a nerd. That's a great way to tease someone and still make them feel good. So feel free to tease people you're close to especially about things they're unlikely to be sensitive about. But be aware that those exact same jokes can come off as hurtful or mocking if you direct them to people who you don't know well who aren't as high on the social totem pole, like lowerclassmen at school or people below you on the org chart at work. And especially avoid teasing those people about something they care about. If you follow this advice, you'll avoid alienating people with these common types of jokes. But unfortunately, there's no guarantee that everyone will like you, especially if you plan to live a life where you take risks and try to be exceptional. You're going to acquire haters and doubters along the way. That's why we created a program designed to help you develop deep and authentic confidence. It's a 30-day program that will give you emotional mastery. So that even if you say the wrong thing in conversation, make a mistake at work, or don't have things go the way you planned, you're able to pick yourself up with confidence and continue to feel great about yourself. No self-doubt, no beating yourself up. The way this works is by focusing first and foremost on your relationship with yourself. This means exercises that put an end to those moments where you're controlled by fear of rejection, failure, or conflict. A very common outcome is that members realize they deeply want to share what they've learned and help other people on their own personal development journeys. So we've added a bonus section that is a crash course in starting a YouTube channel. It's one we made at the very beginning of our channel when we had about 20,000 subscribers. So it's a very tactical explanation of how to build a following from zero. Now, this is only the third time we've spoken about emotional mastery on the YouTube channel. In the past, we only offered it to people who had joined our email list or Charisma University program. And that means there's no page explaining the course, just a checkout page. So if you're intrigued and want to know more, the best thing to do is check out the course directly with the link below. You can do that knowing that it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. There's nothing you need to do, no worksheets to fill out to get the refund. You just go to billing and refund and you'll get every penny back. But I do hope you try it because it addresses how to live with more joy and be less controlled by worrying about what other people think of you. If you'd like to join, click the link below.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Not feeling attractive enough can be a source of insecurity, but luckily being attractive is less dependent on genetics than many people think. So in this video, we're not going to touch on things outside of your control. Although genes do have an impact, you can make yourself more attractive with the way you dress, your attitude, and your actions. So we'll go through three easy ways you can instantly be more attractive, no matter where you're starting from. And for fun, since season five of Lucifer comes out this week, we'll use his character to show these attractive habits. But that said, we're only going to include what will actually work in your real life and leave out any scenes where his devil powers magically make women want him. One of the very first things you'll notice about Lucifer is his style. You see him and instantly have an opinion of him. During this next clip, ask yourself if your first impression would be different if this was how he dressed all the time. While actor Tom Ellis is certainly an attractive man, he does lose some of his sex appeal without Lucifer's style. But that doesn't mean to wear a suit all the time. After all, anyone can wear a suit, and it doesn't automatically make you a sex symbol. Um, uh... The trick is, no matter what your style is, focus on wearing the right fit for your body type and add at least one stylish accessory. In Lucifer's case, he has a few things that separate him from looking like your average working suit. A tight fit, a pocket square, rings, a watch, cufflinks, a five o'clock shadow. People may not notice it consciously, but when you add a few little touches like that, it will change how someone perceives you. Now that said, you don't need to copy Lucifer's particular style to be attractive. Instead, apply those two rules to whatever your own personal style is. And this doesn't have to be excessive. For example, if you normally wear collared shirts, it's as easy as throwing a $10 pair of suspenders over top before heading to the bar. I want to talk about the episode that you're shooting now because you look very dapper. The second thing you can steal from Lucifer to become more attractive is his mindset that flirting is about having fun. Lucifer doesn't take things too seriously. When he flirts, he's playful and focuses on amusing himself. Here's a quick example. But if this little clue thing of yours doesn't pan out, these are going back on and they're going to stay on. Is that a promise? I know some people will comment that this only works because Lucifer is a scripted TV show, so here's two quick examples of Craig Ferguson being playful in the same way, interpreting something non-sexual as sexual. I'm Southern. We're Hansy. We're Hansy in the bib family. Hi. I've been south of the Mason-Duncan. I know what you're talking about. Um, yeah. I kind of dropped the ball, Craig. I don't think anyone would mind. Just pick it up and keep going. Now, sexualizing a conversation does run the risk of seeming creepy, but it's also super easy to be playful without being sexual. This can be especially attractive when you first meet someone. Most people dread the standard boring small talk like, where are you from? And what do you do? So a good trick when flirting is to answer someone's first small talk question playfully and at least 25% of the small talk questions after that. Here's another quick example from Craig, this time messing around with the often asked, where are you from? I'm from Scotland. Jersey. If you can make someone laugh by saying something playful and unexpected, they'll instantly like you more for making the conversation more fun. This will get annoying if you never take anything seriously, but most people go too far the other way. They take too many things too seriously. So being around someone that makes conversation playful is a welcome break from the norm and it can even create a sense of, ah, I wish I could be like that. How long have I been out? Three years. What? You're such an ass. Thank you. As a quick side note, if someone is flirting by fake insulting you like that and your mind goes blank, a smiling thank you is an easy go-to response. This can even be an attractive comeback when someone really is trying to insult you. You are a mockery of everything divine. Thank you. You got some bars on you, pal. Oh, thank you very much, but they're really quite average. When you respond like that, you show that you're confident in who you are and you aren't affected by them. Don't do this if someone's giving you genuine feedback. It's just a nice one if your mind goes blank while someone is teasing you while flirting. It's playful and it also shows you aren't particularly sensitive and that you have confidence in yourself. That unshakable confidence is another attractive aspect of Lucifer's attitude. The quickest way he projects that confidence is by approaching people without hesitation, whether they're beautiful women or dangerous criminals. Lucifer, this is a ruthless drug lord with who knows how many armed thugs. You can't just walk in there with your three-piece suit and say, hello, drug dealers. I would never do that. I'm young, my son. In your own life, avoid the dangerous criminal part and just steal the fearless approach part. Approaching someone you're attracted to without hesitation is a very quick way to display attractive confidence. The mistake most people make when they see someone they're attracted to is they go stand near them and say nothing, hoping that some circumstance will magically lead to them talking to each other. By contrast, Lucifer walks right up and starts a conversation. Oh, hello again, my little cannonball. Sorry, I didn't introduce myself earlier. Lucifer, Morningstar. One of the reasons people hesitate before approaching is because they can't think of anything to say. Spontaneity is nice but if you find yourself at a bar or social event and aren't sure how to start a conversation, a good go-to phrase is, hey, I don't think I've met you yet and then introduce yourself. This sub communicates that you either already know most of the people there or have met a bunch of people already, so it's a nice way to establish that you're social and not a creep. Having that in your back pocket will help you approach someone with confidence. Don't mind if I do. If you want the fastest path to building that kind of unshakable confidence, you may like our 30-day program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program for building your confidence and charisma as quickly as possible. Over 5,000 people have joined the program so far. Here's what just a few of them have had to say about it.

I don't think it's an overstatement to say charisma is literally a gateway to getting anything you want in life, so thank you for making Charisma University. Another member wrote, My biggest breakthrough has been gaining more confidence.

If you're reading this or listening right now, think about who you want to be in a year. This course will teach you how to be that person. And this last one comes from a guy who says Charisma University helps his dating life. He says, Firstly, loving the course.

The program comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is for any reason whatsoever. And it's 60 days even though the course is 30 days just so there's absolutely no risk on your part at all. Either you become more confident and charismatic or you get every penny back.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"A few months ago, I discovered that one of my closest friends had stolen $120,000 from me. And as I dug into this, I found that this betrayal was way, way worse than even that. So I want to share this story with you because, one, it's the greatest and most painful betrayal that I think I've experienced, at least in my adult life. It's the most costly business mistake I've probably ever made, and I don't want this thing to happen to you. Sadly, I've come to see and learn that this pattern of behavior that I thought was basically impossible is far more common than I'd expected. And though it's not a lot of people that do this, they tend to run this pattern over and over again so that the number of people that are actually impacted by this is far, far greater. So if you see any aspect of yourself in this story, I hope that this wakes you up and prevents you from experiencing what I did. For context, several months ago, I'm closing the deal to purchase Charisma on command. I'm a 50% owner. I'm buying 100% from my co-founder because we've been in a deadlock. And this is wonderful and amazing, but it's also the largest purchase I have ever made. So in order to make sure that I can finance it, I start logging into accounts that I haven't been in for years. I'm looking at my retirement account, the 401k that I haven't even looked at. I'm like, okay, I can liquidate this. And the other account that I look in is this crypto account because several years prior, I'd had an employee and this close friend of mine who was named Ivan Hidalgo purchase a bunch of crypto on my behalf. I'd given him $12,000 to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum, and I just hadn't looked at it. Now the good news was crypto had done what crypto did in that period of time, which is that $12,000 had 10X to about 120 grand, which is going to be very, very useful in financing this deal. So I plug it into my computer, I log into this nano ledger, and my heart falls off of a cliff because this graph falls off of a cliff. I watch it go up, up, up, up, up, up, up to $120,000 and then instantly, boom, $45. And my heart is racing, and I'm going, what the heck is going on here? So I try to discern what's happening. And as I hover over the transactions, I see that six months prior to this login, in the middle of the night, in a series of transactions, all of the money in my account was moved to other accounts. So I call the cops, I start trying to figure out what happened, I make that frog report. And immediately, I think there's only one person that this really could have been because Ivan bought this for me. And when he bought it for me, he sent me a photo of the seed phrase, which is effectively the crypto password, right? It's a list of words that if you lose access to this ledger, you can still get access to your account. And so that existed digitally. But I'm thinking, because I'm still naive at this point in time, maybe a family member of his got access to it. Maybe he lost his phone, and somebody ran an AI scraper, and they dug it, and they found it. Now, this was especially naive. And you'll see this pattern over and over again, because about a year and a half prior, I'd fired him for lying to me and gray area stealing, which is no longer a gray area. I now see what actually happened. But I fired him for that. So we weren't in contact at this point in time. We were no longer cool with one another. So I reached out to my co-founder, who was still in interaction with him. I was talking to him because of the deal and said, hey, can you check, like, did he lose his phone about six months ago? Did you hear anything? Does his number change to a green number? He's like, no, still same phone number. So I start piecing it together. And I go to my crypto friends, and they help me with this website called Arkham Intelligence. And they say, you put any crypto wallet in here, and it will show you all of the interactions that this wallet has had publicly. So thank God for these friends. I take the account that took the money. I put it into Arkham Intelligence. And boom, it explodes with information. It's got all these charts. And I'm filtering through this, like, black screen, super matrix style, except that's not matrix. It's so obvious. It's not reading zeros and ones. Because I look, and his literal name is present on this page. Investor Ivan is staring at me. His OpenSea NFT account that I witnessed him access from my apartment is listed as having interacted with the account that took the money. Thank God. Thank you. You know who you are, my friends. I love you. I appreciate you. You helped me a ton. So I feel a huge wave of relief, but also like, oh, crap. No more deception. This is what happened. So I draft this text in this email, which is to him, hey, I know exactly what happened on this night. I know exactly what you did. Send this crypto back, and this will be the end of it. If you don't, there's going to be a civil and a criminal case, and you're looking at potentially years in jail. Because I've done the whole chat GPT, what could likely happen from this? This is not a small amount of money. A significant amount of time goes by, like a day or two, when I get a response from him that is, hey, I'm on vacation, not sure what you're talking about, essentially. And I'll put receipts up so you can check it out if you'd like. I write back, you know what I'm talking about. Don't pretend. Send me the money. I'm hearing through my co-founder, who I'm discussing this deal with at the time, that he really doesn't know, because he's talking to him and saying, I've never heard of this. This is so strange. I haven't heard from you in years. So weird. I'm on vacation. I can't. I'm busy. I can't even handle this. And he's treating it seemingly like it's not a big deal. So I continue to write, and I'm talking to friends who tell me that I am going to have to show him hard evidence. Because in one of his texts to me, he says, these are huge accusations. If you have any hard proof, I'd like to see it, which is a weird thing to say. Like, how would I have hard proof of something that didn't happen? But I do. And so they coach me through the recording of this video that I start the first time I record it. I'm screaming and swearing. And I show them. I'm like, is this what I should send to him? They're like, no, no, no. Less swear words. We're not trying to scream at him. We're trying to get him to send the money back. So they help me with the charisma aspect of this, which is to flatly explain everything in this video that I send to him. This is you, Ivan. This is your wallet. It's only got like 30 transactions in the last four years. And there's multiple instances of you interacting with Investor Ivan on OpenSea, which is your OpenSea NFT account that I can tie directly to you. The options that you have are continue to deny this, bring that denial to court and see how it goes. I wouldn't recommend it. You're going to lose both the civil and criminal case. And then you're looking at actual jail time. I don't recommend it. I'm willing to do that. The other option is that you can send me back the money now. And what do you know? He gets this video and remembers, oh, yeah. And the process begins of him sending me this money back, which I was able to recover in full, except that it took, you know, some some teeth pulling in order to get him to do it, obviously. And he would not refund me for the cost of the nano ledger. But he did wish me a happy Thanksgiving. Which seems strange after everything that happened. Just for context, this was someone who had been to my house for multiple Thanksgivings. This was my genuinely second closest friend after my co-founder. This was someone who I took to my sister's wedding as my plus one, even though it was like a kind of a goofy thing to do. He slept on my couch for months at a time. Full access to everything in my life and my heart, genuinely, like so much care and affection and trust was given to him. So that happy Thanksgiving line, it just cuts even like, holy shit. Was any of this real? And that thought keeps echoing in my head because, yes, I have the money. But now I can think this guy's been hired for years. He had intimate access to everything in my life, including my business. So I have to go look. And at this point, I've bought the business. So I now have access to his old email account and my co-founder's old email account. There's just correspondence in there that is helpful for me to dig into. So I start going into Ivan's old email account and I find, which is something that you should start to pay attention to, a lot of weird stuff. The first thing that I find is seemingly ridiculous lies. Like one of the things that's in there is a lease agreement for the apartment he'd been living in. And he told me that the apartment was like a certain amount of money, let's say X per month. But this lease agreement has it listed as one half of that amount of money. Why lie about that? And I started to see there were so many of these unnecessary, small, for seemingly no purpose lies that I was able to corroborate through this email and through speaking to other people about this. I also started to talk to people and I found that there was this pattern of behaving differently around people of status and power. So with me, I experienced him as very generous and very kind. My brother was friends with him, but he'd stay at the apartment. But my brother was constantly complaining that he was not paying for coffees, that sticking my brother with the bill, that he was stealing his clothes even though he would tell him not to do it and sort of just shrugging it off. And I was like, oh, you know, they're just bickering. They were almost like brothers themselves, like me and my brother, whatever, it's fine. And I realized that when I stepped away from the business, this same thing happened, which is now that I didn't have power, our relationship completely shifted. He stopped answering my calls. It was just over. And so this pattern of behaving one way in the face of status and power and a genuinely another for others is something to pay attention to and to listen to the stories of people around you who relate this to you. But far more serious in these emails and in correspondence with my co-founders was the founding story of why we had even hired him. You see, at the time when he was hired, I think in 2018, I was very busy with videos and my co-founder did this hire. He ran the process and I came in at the end for like the final which of these two people. But I hadn't seen any of the references. I hadn't really seen the application. I hadn't seen even there was a story that he had sold his digital marketing agency. Ivan had done this to a larger digital marketing agency for three million Canadian, which is why he was wanting a new era of his life. He wanted to be a mentee essentially at a larger business, but had all of these digital skills and provided tax documents and references and weird looking like income forms. But all of this had come in and so I finally get eyes on this and I see, oh shit. As I start to really look at it, yeah, at first glance, these are tax documents. They're like signed. They're filled out except the business number and the year is listed as well. This is like a 2016 tax document. When I run that business number in Ontario's business lookup and find the actual business, the business isn't founded until September of 2017. So I'm looking at a tax document that doesn't correspond with public records. He's written in his application like this is the name of the company I sold to, but I can't let you talk to them right now, the lawyers or whatever. It wasn't even something, some weird thing. But when I call that company and say, hey, did you guys purchase a business for roughly 3 million Canadian in 2018? The woman goes, no. I say, ah, well, maybe you wouldn't know. She says, no, I've been here for 20 years. Let me put you in with the CEO. I'll have him email you. So he emails me and says, hey, how can I help? And I explain the situation and within like a five minute phone call and two hours of waiting, I get back an email from the CEO that says, I do not know what this is. I don't know what you're talking about. So the entire founding story that predicated this business relationship, this friendship that was, I thought like so close, someone that I would genuinely like, I didn't care about money. If I'd lost money, which I lost a tremendous amount working with him because he was not effective at his job, obviously, because he hadn't done the things that he said that he'd done. That didn't matter because he was my friend. And so this caused a tremendous amount of pain, but also a lot of how the hell did this happen? What was occurring in me that I created space for this? And there's a number of things. I told you some of the small ones, but the real one that I want you to pay attention for is if you don't trust your own sense of distrust, because I did not. When I thought that someone was lying to me or wronging me, particularly in a huge way, I would start to feel like I was mean. I was being bad. How could I accuse that person of that, especially in the face of someone who double tripled and quadruple downed? Now, I could confront someone for a minute, and if they said, yeah, you're right, that would create that instant relief, but I would feel so guilty if I believed something bad about someone else that they contended was not true about them. And so I look back at my own correspondence with my co-founder, and I see this instantly. I have an email to him that's like, this feels like a mentorship. He hasn't taught me anything. He has no discernible expertise. He can't even seem to write, which was all like it was ridiculous how bad his work was. It was so bad that we stopped paying him for a month, and I thought that was such an admirable thing of him to not get paid for that first month, but it was so abysmal. What I didn't realize is that I had this distrust of my own distrust that became pathological responsibility taking. Pay attention for this, because instead of saying, you know, we disagree, and therefore you're going to go, it was, you know, you say this, and I don't feel it, therefore I need to give you more opportunities to show yourself to me. I need to elevate your position. I need to explain myself more clearly. I need to give you a different project, because if you couldn't succeed in that one, but you say this is true about you, I must not be using you effectively. And so for the next several years, I promoted endlessly. He would fail, and I would give him another promotion to incentivize him to do better in this way of like, what have I not done right here that is making this apparently very effective tool not work? And that was how he had access to things like, I was like, oh, well, maybe he can help me with crypto investing. All of this came because things weren't working, because I was ashamed of my own sense of distrust, because I didn't want to have the experience of sitting in front of someone and saying, I don't believe you. This feels completely false to me, and I don't want to work with you any longer. And it wasn't the same nefarious fabricated lie, but that same thing was present with my co-founder, because what I didn't want to do, and I brought it up several times, was say, I don't trust the way that you ran this process. I don't trust that this is the best possible candidate. I don't trust that you're effectively doing your job, because if I had done that, the underlying fear would have come rushing to the surface, which is, I'll be alone. Because if I dig into this, and I find that you didn't do a good job here while I'm doing these videos, this calls into question our business relationship, which was already, there were things that were sort of sticking out as, this isn't working great. And I did not want to see things, because I did not want to have to go it alone for any period of time. And this is so critical. I see this constantly in romantic relationships and close partnerships. From the third party, you'll be standing there reading somebody's text exchange, or the history of how their boyfriend went out and had this really suspicious activity, and it'll be really obvious that something is off. But you'll watch someone contort themselves in order to believe the story. Because what is really driving them is this terror of being alone. And so they'll confront the person and basically allow them to lie to their face, because it soothes that feeling of, now I have to go it alone. And so just ask yourself, is that occurring in my life? Am I taking pathological responsibility? Am I terrified of being alone but not acknowledging, and therefore lowering my standard? What you will do in these circumstances is avoid. You will avoid looking at the text. You will avoid digging into the references. You will avoid going back and saying, hey, that was a weird story. I'm going to actually get external verification of that. You will avoid all of that, and that will feel mean or bad if you were to do it. Pay attention. And so I hope that those yellow-red flags are sticking out to you. I hope, and one other thing I should say is that if you've known me over the years, and we've interacted, and you've felt that I have explicitly or implicitly vouched for Ivan as a worker or anything, I would just want to make clear that I do not. I do not. If that's not already evident, I unfortunately expect that this pattern could continue for two reasons. One, after all of this theft, when I'm in the business, I log into the Instagram account to find that there's logins coming from the country that he's in, and I go in and see that even after all the theft and the return, he apparently is liking his own photos from the Charisma on Command account, which signals to me that this pattern of like image construction has not stopped. And also, I reached out to him to be a part of this video. I gave him the questions that I had. I told him that the way that I wanted this video to go was for him to be to tell his story on screen and to investigate where this pattern comes from, and hopefully that it would be like a healing moment, which was perhaps naive but wishful thinking of me. He said that our interactions in the last two years had been negative and stressful. These are the interactions where my money has been stolen and finally returned. And that's why he didn't want to do it and really refused to answer any of the questions that I'd asked and then blocked me. So that's what I'd like you to know about that. I hope that for some of you, this is a wake-up call. For the rest of you, that's my heart. I just wanted to share it with you. So thank you. I appreciate you guys watching, and I will see you in the next video. Peace.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 1123}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, we'll break down some jokes from Ryan Reynolds and Ricky Gervais so you can learn how to make people laugh and love being around you. There are two techniques you can use to make almost anyone laugh. The first is surprise. We laugh when someone subverts our expectations. For example, watch this clip of Ricky hosting the Golden Globes. On a serious note, just looking at all the faces here reminds me of some of the great work that's been done this year by cosmetic surgeons. That's an example of a sincerity fake-out. You set expectations that you're going to say something sincere then you undercut those expectations for a laugh. Here's another example. Listen to Ryan Reynolds talk about having Hugh Jackman in Deadpool 3. These fake-out jokes aren't limited to just sincerity fake-outs. For instance, anytime you're asked a question with an obvious answer and you want to make people laugh, you can turn it into a fake-out joke. For a funny example, watch Ricky Gervais talk with Piers Morgan about gun control. You can basically steal his setup word for word. If you want to try these fake-out jokes in your own life, there's a little trick you can do to get a bigger laugh. Take a one-second pause before the punchline. When you pause, people unconsciously try to complete your sentence in their mind. This makes it funnier when you fake out their expectations. If this seems like it would be difficult for you, there's an even easier way to make anyone laugh with surprise. Wait for someone to ask you a question, think of what they expect you to say, and then say the opposite. When you can't think of the perfect opposite answer, you can also make people laugh with an absurd answer. Now, you don't want to just say something wacky that makes no sense. The key is to ask yourself, what is the most absurd thing that could plausibly answer this question? Beyond surprise, there's a second way you can make people laugh — specificity. Specifically, you want to create a ridiculous mental image in the person's mind. So, for example, instead of saying, I don't like watching the news, you can say something like this. Here's another example with Ricky Gervais. If you just call someone pale, it probably won't get a laugh, so listen to what he says instead. As a side note, once you find a joke that makes people laugh, you can store it away as a go-to joke for the future. Comedians like Ryan and Ricky look quick on their feet, but often they're actually reusing a joke they've had success with before. You're the whitest man I've ever met. I imagine naked, you're nearly translucent. Like you can see your heart like one of those little baby fish. Now, let's talk about a mindset that holds a lot of people back from being funny. It's the belief that you are a failure if people don't laugh at every single one of your jokes. This unrealistic mindset causes you to hold back from saying things that you find funny because you're scared other people won't laugh. So you filter yourself which creates that feeling of being stuck in your head. This habit of censoring yourself thinking what you have to say isn't good enough is a poison that erodes your confidence over time. You may not realize it, but it's the willingness to have a joke bomb that allows all the world's funniest people to build their quick wit. Just as an example, watch how many times Ryan Reynolds riffs on a joke before making everyone laugh. I will shove a red card so far up your ass people will think it's your tongue. I will shove a red card so far up your ass we'll need a team of doctors to find my hand. I will shove a red card so far up your ass you will be legally reclassified as a puppet. In your own life, you won't get the chance to try three different jokes in a row, but you can lower your filter. Not everything you say will make people laugh, but you'll see what works and what doesn't and you'll become funnier over time and you'll have more fun in conversation. Now, so far in this video, we've covered a lot of sarcastic jokes. The downside of sarcasm is you can accidentally come off as a jerk especially if you're teasing people. So what can you do to be seen as funny not a bully? One factor in this is how people perceive you pick the targets for your jokes. A bully is someone whose jokes always target the weak or people they don't like. If people see you making fun of yourself too, they're less likely to feel picked on. This is something you'll see both Ryan and Ricky do often. For example, listen to Ryan talk about his gin company. It's an American gin, a little smoother than its British counterparts, a little more drinkable. Wow, I sound like a pro. Yeah, you're actually good. I really know nothing about gin. If I ran the company for real, it would be on fire. Similarly, Ricky Gervais is known for his brutal roasts, but he's just as brutal with his self-deprecating humor. Getting caught in the zipper. Does that mean this zipper? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. Well, that's never happened. Just one of the advantages of having a very small penis. This doesn't mean you should be the butt of the joke every time, but if people see you occasionally tease yourself, they won't take it as personally when you tease them. Another factor that influences whether people think you're funny or a jerk is what you tease. Ricky Gervais is a professional comedian, so he roasts himself and others hard, but in your own life, your best bet is to tease something that's unlikely to be an insecurity. For example, listen to Ricky tease Leonardo DiCaprio in this next clip and watch Leo's reaction. It wasn't the only epic movie. Once upon a time in Hollywood, nearly three hours long, Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere and by the end, his date was too old for him. You should apply this kindness to yourself as well. Tease yourself for things you aren't actually insecure about, so you're comfortable with other people doubling up on the joke. This will depend entirely on your own level of thick skin and your sense of humor. Here's a great example of this with Ryan Reynolds teasing himself. I think what makes other people laugh is me standing next to you anywhere because you make me look like Timothee Chalamet. Obviously, Ryan isn't ashamed of being smaller than the rock and that's what makes a great tease — something that makes people laugh, not something that creates shame. At the end of the day, you don't want your jokes to hurt other people. Make your jokes a gift that makes life a little lighter. If you do it right, you'll make the people around you laugh, feel good, and love being around you. You also don't want to be sarcastic all the time. It's important to show your kind, caring side as well. Now, you might think building the funny habits in this video will take you a long time or maybe you even think it's impossible for you — that you could never actually put this stuff into practice in your own life. But becoming more well-liked is much easier than you might think. With the right blueprint, you can become significantly more charismatic in just a few weeks. If you want the fastest way I know of to take your charisma and confidence to the next level, you may like our program, Charisma University. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. One of the best investments in my life — the content and the action guide have changed me radically. I received a job offer three weeks ago — the reason why they want me for this job — Your charisma and your ability to connect with everyone are rare and of great value. Thanks to your teaching, I learned the ability to build deep connections and friendships — it was worth the money. In the past, when meeting people, I'd freeze and my mind would go blank or I couldn't get out of my head. Now, I feel the same confidence and peace of mind that I have with my friends come back to me when meeting new people. Thanks to CU, I've built a great circle of new friends. Your course has been life-changing to the point where I wake up in the mornings feeling like I've been transferred to a new person's body — the person I kept dreaming about becoming before I found Charisma on Command. It is incredible. The program is literally guaranteed to change your life — that means you can take the entire course and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund right inside the program. If you want to see if Charisma University is right for you, click the link on screen now or in the description below. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video. I really appreciate you taking the time to watch it and I hope to see you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 536}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Jumanji is back and once again, The Rock, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black are getting together. All three are super charismatic — we've covered them in previous breakdowns — but today I thought it would be fun to combine their strengths and talk about how you can build rock-solid confidence from the ground up going from shy to confident. And to do this, I'll be pulling from some previous videos I've made as well as some new clips to learn how to combine the best of Kevin, Dwayne, and Jack into one confident mega beast. So let's start from ground zero — you're new to a group, no one knows you, or maybe you're even in that group for a while but you're just shy. It's hard to feel confident when you're being ignored or overlooked and it's in these times that Kevin Hart's penchant for commanding attention is exactly what you need. You know when you get smacked when you're a kid, you get hype. When you get by yourself, you're gonna smack me. In front of my friends, you're gonna smack me in front of my friends! There are two important steps to commanding attention while you speak. First, you need to grab attention and then you have to keep it. Now, when it comes to grabbing people's attention, giving them a reason to care goes a long way so no matter if you're about to tell a story, make a joke, or contribute your opinion on something, you can more easily get a group to listen by describing why what you're about to say matters like Kevin does here. And then you got asked to meet the President of the United States? Huge. Huge! I mean... Let me tell you why this was huge, Jim. Kevin achieves the goal of gathering attention even more subtly in this next clip by hinting at a strong emotion in the story to come. Here's where my frustration moment came. I'm by myself. This is real. I can tell. This is gonna be a real one. I'm by myself. These habits can help wallflowers avoid what is unfortunately fairly common for them — having their contributions in conversation ignored. But if you give people a reason, a strong emotion, or just hint at some drama to come, you build anticipation and make people more likely to listen to what you're about to say. Now, one thing that can be tricky if you're shy is the pension groups have to interrupt one another. If you're shy, you're likely to defer rather easily and potentially fall out of conversation entirely. So a simple better habit to convey confidence is to be a bit less deferential when you begin to speak and one way to do this is to repeat yourself until you have the group's attention. This is a fairly extreme version but here's what it looks like when Kevin does it. Right now, I think it's happening that I'm the cool guy. Kevin is incredibly awkward in the way he's handling this interview. I don't think I've ever been the awkward guy. Now, this level of persistence may feel over-the-top but when you're extremely shy, moving in the direction of being more assertive is often what is necessary. It doesn't mean that you need to repeat every little sentence that is talked over or that you'll never get cut off again but it does mean that you should practice repeating yourself a few times in the event that you do get cut off even if it means coming back to a point after a short detour where the group went in a different direction. Now, repeating yourself might get, well, a little bit repetitive so another simple way to grab people's attention is by speaking a bit more loudly than usual and, of course, this can be in extreme cases as is here with the joke... I just want to back you up. Security! Is this serious? ...or you can simply enter into conversation with a bit of a louder tone to clear some air time to convey your ideas like here. This is really bad. As you can see, I was a cool kid though. He was cool in high school. That's the thing. Always cool. You can tell. I never had a problem with being cool. In order to keep attention once you've captured it, having something interesting to say is, of course, a good thing but often not enough. You've probably heard a teacher or professor delivering a lecture in a monotonous voice. No matter how good the content is, it's easy to lose focus but look how Kevin Hart tells a story. ...and I'd be damned if I didn't feel a flame like crushed by my cheek a little bit. I said, hey, man! I just felt the flame! He's like, he goes, impossible. I said to myself, I was like, I'm sick of this sh**. If you speak like this, alternating with moments of more slow subdued energy and then with moments of higher intensity, perhaps volume and pace, you keep people's attention. Changing your pitch and playing characters by giving them different voices and gesticulating can be even more effective because it pulls people into the story like here. When it comes to really painting a picture, Jake is, they're coming, they jump, and then after that, this stuff coming out. If that seems like too much for strangers, you can start by practicing this habit with your friends. That way, it doesn't matter if you come across as a little bit goofy. Moving along, once you get comfortable commanding attention, the most confident thing to do can be counterintuitive. It's to redistribute some of that attention back to other people. This is where the rock style comes in. He is a big dude in every way from his physical size to his gestures to his smile to his position as a triple-A list celebrity so attention naturally gravitates towards him. You can stand. It's okay. Come on, man. Look, it's pretty. It's beautiful. Look at that. It's just a butterfly. It's always me. Hold your hand up. But instead of basking in the spotlight and making everything about himself, Dwayne takes the opposite approach. He often brings it back to other people and when you make the people around you feel included and appreciated, you set yourself up as a leader in any situation which, of course, can make your confidence skyrocket. Now, an easy and super effective way to make people feel included is by giving them recognition especially when they're not expecting it. For instance, watch how Dwayne remembers and congratulates this interviewer. I was really excited when I found out you're going to be in this movie because I thought— Hold on a second, dude. Hold on. Hold on a second. Congratulations. I know it's a year, year and a half ago. You graduated, dude. Thank you, my friend. Good to see you. You're kicking ass. You're out in the world. You're kicking ass. I'm hanging out with you. You're in Rio. I'm with you, man. Look at this. It's all downhill from here. Where do we go? Or take a look here where he praises the interviewer's question and acknowledges his passion for his job. How do they make that look like you actually fell down, hit the landing, and then you continue in the same shot? So cool question. So we had a camera rig. I love your questions, by the way. Thanks, man. This is why you love movies, man. I love this stuff, man. It's my favorite stuff to ask. I love it. In your own life, you can deliver these types of compliments after someone tells a funny story or shares something that they're proud of. You pause the flow of conversation for a short bit just to let them know what you appreciate about them assuming, of course, that you do, in fact, appreciate it. It is a short moment but it can mean a lot to someone. Now, this is especially true of those people who might expect to be overlooked. This can be younger colleagues at school or work or the service people at your favorite food joint. A good rule of thumb when you're in a position of high status is that if you find yourself telling a story or answering questions for more than two minutes, it's probably a good idea to bring it back to the other person by asking their opinion, turning the question back on them, or just starting a new more inclusive conversational thread. Though, of course, if they insist on hearing you share a story or a lesson, it's totally fine to continue. Now, another way in which Dwayne involves other people and makes them feel appreciated is through friendly touch. Here, you can see him expressing his love for Danny DeVito who he knows quite well at this point. A lot of fun. I love you. I love you, too. But for people who he might not be comfortable kissing on the head, The Rock also has a habit of offering enthusiastic high-fives. Herman, right now, I got your carrot top. Reese Witherspoon, how badass was that? Despite how juvenile they may seem, high-fives are actually an easy way to spread positivity and develop confidence for leading a conversation in a more energetic direction. When you offer someone a high-five for any silly reason, most people will follow your lead and it tends to boost both people's mood which, of course, leads to both of you feeling more confident for the rest of that interaction. And the last thing which you also saw in that last clip is to laugh generously. It's a simple way to give appreciation in a way that lifts everyone up and it's especially effective once you've become a leader in your group. ... ... So far, we've talked about building from shyness towards greater comfort and holding attention then to spreading that attention back to others as your confidence booms. But one thing that is common to both modes of being whether you're more towards the shy or already feeling a bit more confident is the need for commitment and this is where Jack Black comes in because he fully commits to his actions. That's what makes him able to go off with hilarious bits of physical comedy like here. ... ... ... You see another great example of that commitment in this next clip where Jack is asked to imitate The Rock and he even gets that habit of recognizing interviewers as he does so. I'm glad you asked that question. First of all, you're Kathleen from Screen Junkies, right? I never forget a face, I never forget a thing. Life is a delicious drink that you have to suck deep. Now, commitment can be easier said than enacted when you're in an uncomfortable position because in those situations, most of us get very stuck in our heads wondering how we're being perceived but, of course, acting hesitant only makes us feel less confident which makes us come across even worse and you can see this vicious cycle in action in a young Jaden Smith. In this next clip, he has the right idea of repeating himself when he's cut off but without conviction, he just gets talked over and feels doubly ignored. Yeah, no, that is something. That'll get you really humble. How does that get you humble? Well, because people sort of... The solution then to building more conviction is actually to lowering your standards. Oftentimes, that lack of conviction comes from an inability to simply relax and do something that you're unfamiliar with less than perfectly to allow yourself to say something dumb or do something poorly without self-reproach as Jack often does. And you can see in his Dwayne Johnson rant, for instance, that he repeats the same words but just plows through. That's the approach that I take to life. That's how I approach everything. Life is a delicious drink that you have to suck deep. There's no time. And when he plays basketball with Kevin Hart, he's terrible but his enthusiasm makes everyone glad to have him on the court anyway. All right! It's game time! I yelled that so loud I got lightheaded. Yes! And this is yet another key — Jack is committed to having fun and when you fully commit to the things that you do from that perspective of having fun, most people will end up liking and respecting you no matter how ridiculous you look. And even more importantly, you will feel much more confident because you won't be held back by your perceived lack of skill or talent. Here, Jack is explaining the core of this mindset. Did you see my moves? Yeah, I did. So I don't really have the moves. No, you do. I thought I'd make up for it with just like commitment. To putting all this in practice, first, figure out where you are on the spectrum from more shy and reserved to outgoing and talkative. If you're close to shy, play around with speaking more loudly like Kevin Hart. Get a bit more into your characters when you tell story and speak as if you expect to be listened to, perhaps repeating yourself if you get cut off. If you're already more of an outgoing leader, you might try laughing a little bit bigger at other people's jokes like The Rock. You can give enthusiastic high-fives to include more people or simply deliver compliments with eye contact and sincerity to further reinforce your own confidence while making other people feel good. If you practice even just for a day one of these behaviors in a way that is committed to being playful, your results in confidence will shoot through the roof. If you want more help with how exactly to do that, our Charisma University program comes with 30 daily action guides that give you the step-by-step path to unshakable confidence. You can read all about it in the link below but the best way to let you know what the course is about is to just let members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written in. The first is from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, Another person wrote about their social life saying, I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system. And this last one is from someone who says that the course has been life-changing and he says, And you can see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do so, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all. And I make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value out of the course. Otherwise, you can just refund. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead, click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course, get a ton out of it — introverts, extroverts, men and women from all over the globe and I would love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope that you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 793}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Sometimes, becoming powerful can make people act like jerks. Very amusing. Tell me, which do you favor — your fingers or your tongue? The same thing can happen as you improve your charisma which is a measure of social power. If you're not careful, you can become a domineering leader that is disliked for how you wield that social clout. So in this video, we're covering three common myths about being an alpha personality that actually just make people dislike you and what tweaks you can make to be a respected leader that people love to be around. And to clarify, I know that some people have disputed the use of the term alpha in human societies. For this video, I'm simply referring to the word in the way that I most often hear it used to describe the type of person that is popular, attractive, assertive, and because of that, often the center of attention which segues nicely into the first point. Alpha personalities can easily capture and maintain the attention of others. They do this with their confidence, body language, storytelling — all things that we've covered in previous videos. But there is a misconception that may lead to some people acting like jerks and that is that the best way to use all of this attention is to focus on yourself either by telling repeated stories of your own successes or simply by stating how great you are. I'm the best ever. I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless champion there's ever been. We admire that kind of braggy behavior in athletes but that's because it's a performative display. That behavior would never win you raving fans in your normal life. The people who are both powerful and well-liked are those who spread positive attention to others. Socially, you can spread this attention via compliments. A few hours. Thank you very much. Years I've been waiting for that. Or you can simply remember people who might not expect you to do so. If you're The Rock, that might mean an interviewer but in your life, it could be a doorman, cashier, or service person that you see on a regular basis. I was really excited when I found out you're going to be in this movie because I thought— Hold on a second, dude. Hold on. Hold on a second. Congratulations. I know it's a year, year and a half ago you graduated, dude. Thank you, my friend. Good to see you. You're kicking ass. You're out in the world. You're kicking ass. It's especially important to not just extend this kindness to people who are cool or loud or noticeable. In fact, the most powerful way you can use this technique is to share it with the person who is unseen in a particular social situation. For instance, in the next clip, you'll see Tom Cruise being interviewed by Conan O'Brien while Andy Richter waits quietly. That's Andy's job. He's not supposed to be the focus but he's still there. So rather than simply talk to Conan, Tom repeatedly brings Andy into the conversation. It's a little bit tricky to see since Andy's off-screen but the first time he includes him briefly and later, he asks him what his call sign would be if he were in Top Gun. ...before you were born. I have— You are Coco. I want you to just randomly call me at different times— Which one would yours be? What's that? Oh, gosh. Lazy? Lazy? Now, I can't speak exactly to how Andy felt in this moment but if you've ever been in a similar situation where a conversation is going on around you, you might like to join but you don't really know what to say, and then someone in the group found a way to include you, you know that that feels amazing. With a few considerate words, that person made a lasting positive impression on you. So when you are the one in a social situation where you have more social power, maybe because you're high-ranking at work or you're at a house party where there's a friend of a friend that no one knows well or simply because you've developed your charisma, make sure to redirect attention to the person on the outside either with a compliment or by asking their opinion. It may mean the world to that person and it only enhances your position as an alpha leader. The second misconception about alphas is how they use their bodies. There's a misconception that the body is all about intimidation. They get big muscles so that they get physically dominant over people if there's ever a conflict. If he ever acts up, I will knock his teeth so far down his throat that he'll stick a toothbrush up his ass to brush. Oh, okay. That example is obviously a joke. The Rock is talking about John Cena who is his friend but you can see this example for real with Tom Cruise as he leans aggressively into Matt Lauer's space as they're having an argument. Now, this isn't going to break into a fistfight but there is a threatening tenor to a conversation when someone is pointing at you while speaking leaning closely into your space. Do you know what Adderall is? Do you know Ritalin? Do you know now that Ritalin is a street drug? Do you understand that? The difference is this was not against your will, though. But this wasn't against your will. Matt, I'm asking you a question. And you should. And you should do that also because just knowing people who are on Ritalin isn't enough. You should be a little bit more responsible in knowing... I'm not prescribing Ritalin, Tom. Now, it's true that being physically imposing can get people to defer to you. In fact, if you lean in and scream at someone who's scared, they might give you what you want in that moment. But in the long-term, the most beloved personalities do not rely on their bodies to threaten other people. Rather, they use their bodies and they use touch to initiate friendly physical contact and initiating is key. Watch how Conor McGregor dictates the tenor of greeting when he sees Jimmy Fallon. Let's go, Seamus. How are you, my good to see you, brother? Good to see you. He leads the interaction starting with the smile and hug which is immediately endearing. And you could see the same principle of initiating friendly contact in mid-conversation with handshakes or high-fives. Congratulations. Thank you, brother. I appreciate that. Can you imagine? Yeah. Can you imagine? A key to doing this in a way that exudes a sort of alpha confidence is to commit to these handshakes or high-fives while you're speaking. Not to pick on him but there is a contrast between how Jimmy approaches these situations when he's talking to Conor. He seems to go in for these touches but hesitates either touching Conor lightly on the shoulder or pulling back completely. It's not a huge deal but in your own life, these pseudo touches are probably more uncomfortable than simply giving someone a committed high-five or shoulder pat. And I'm sure that this is happening unconsciously for Jimmy as it is for all of us. So, simply pay more attention to the friendly touches in your next social interaction. You can go for high-fives, that shoulder pat, or the back pat if you're close with someone. Practice doing this in a committed way so that you don't wind up doing hover hands. And if you're curious, the same tenet holds true for women. Our video on Oprah covers this aspect of her charisma in detail. Now, lastly, people seem to think that being alpha is about being stone-faced all the time. They think that power must come with an air of never really being impressed by what's going on around you. This is a misunderstanding of the principle of non-reactivity which I covered in last week's video on Don Draper. Basically, that principle states that underreacting in situations of stress breeds both internal confidence and confidence in the people that you lead. Now, you must recognize that this principle does not apply to positive emotions. In fact, being socially dominant, being alpha, usually means being comfortable expressing more positive emotion than most people do. Take a look at the enthusiasm with which The Rock tells a story. He takes the thing off and he throws it to the crowd and I caught it. And it was a big, like, nerd-out moment. Really? We cried nerd tears. Yeah, we did. I was like, oh, and I caught it. It was amazing. You see the same thing with Conor wanting more days to celebrate illustrating his philosophy as he speaks it. But here in the US, they celebrate St. Patrick's week. And it was the best week of my life. When I get home, I'm going to start campaigning. Let's start adding more holidays. Let's start celebrating more. That is the key to success. You must celebrate where you come from, be proud of where you come from. So as a general rule of thumb, yes, remain non-reactive in those times of stress but amp up your positive expression. This can be with your voice tone or your word choice. Additionally, combining this with the first point, you can be more generous in laughing at the jokes of the people around you. This attitude is good for you and it lifts the spirits of everyone present. My wife calling, I'm not here. You know that old joke. Now, I recognize that as you're watching this, you may be thinking that hitting The Rock or Tom Cruise's level of enthusiasm might feel like a big leap for you. So a great place to start is simply by speaking through a smile. That basically just means that rather than having your resting face be neutral, as you're speaking, you're starting from the baseline of a smile so you can see it behind your eyes and your mouth as you're speaking. Take a look at this video for an example of what you can do today without having your friends think that you've gone a bit crazy. It's just in us. It's in us as Irish men, you know what I mean? So we've been fighting our entire existence. If you find that you're hesitating and feeling locked up when it comes time to be confident in these situations, maybe it's with your touch or with your enthusiasm, sometimes, the act of priming yourself can go a long way. That is purposely putting yourself in a more confident and joyful state before going out to work or to socialize. And if you're looking for a ready-made way to do that, you may be interested in a confidence visualization exercise that I have made and it is courtesy of today's video sponsor, Simple Habit. Simple Habit is an app with tons of guided meditations and one of those is this 15 to 20-minute confidence primer that I made that is only available there. You listen to it, you go through the visualization exercise, and you generate internal feelings of confidence before you go out into a stressful situation. And if you click the link in the description, you can check that exercise out as well as all of the guided meditations on Simple Habit for one week for free. And that includes ones that I have made beyond that confidence, ones, again, only available on this app. If you decide to go for the free one-week trial, I also recommend listening to meditations on joy and gratitude because, really, those are some of the best emotions you can have and we could all use more of them. If you like the app, it's just $11.99 a month to continue after that first week. Either way, you've got nothing to lose from giving it a try. The trial is completely free and you can click the link on screen or in the description to take advantage right now.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"No one teaches you how to flirt which is a shame because it means that sometimes, even with the best of intentions, you can come across as creepy. In fact, it's more common than you might think and especially if you like someone, you do not want that to be the case. So in this video, you're going to learn four common ways that you might be creeping your flirt out without even realizing it and what you can do to adjust so that you come across as cool, confident, and suave. First off, remember the Goldilocks rule — when it comes to eye contact, not too much and not too little. Now, we all know what too much eye contact looks like — it's when a guy sees a girl and just stares at her or worse, when he gets right up in her face and invades her personal space — you probably know not to do that. But what most people don't realize is that too little eye contact can be just as uncomfortable. Approaching someone from behind is usually going to freak them out even worse if it's on the dance floor. Now, you need to get this just right and here's how — you make eye contact and hold for long enough to smile at this person. If she glances away, no big deal but if she smiles back, you can consider that an invitation to go speak with her. Just make sure not to do this too many times without actually approaching her otherwise, she may think, why is this person staring at me and not saying anything? Best is to usually approach within the first one to three times you actually make eye contact. Now, the second common way that you might inadvertently come across as creepy is by laying on the compliments a little too thick. You know when you hear someone say something like, Oh my gosh, you're just so beautiful like, wow, I don't even know it's like you fell from heaven. It gets a little bit cringy, right? An easy way to fix that scenario is by combining sincere compliments that aren't over-the-top with the joke to ease the tension and this works because when someone over compliments you, say, someone at work who might want a promotion or an intern, it feels like they want something from you. That compliment builds tension and it doesn't get released. The same thing occurs socially but if instead, you say something sincere and then playfully tease the person, that releases the tension. For instance, you might say something like, I'm really having an awesome time talking to you. Too bad that you're a Patriots fan and we can never hang out again. That allows the compliment to land without building unnecessary discomfort because the person laughs at the end. And that takes us to our next point — the third most common way that guys come across as being a little bit too creepy is with touch. Again, the Goldilocks rule applies here — too heavy or too light can both be bad. Now, the first is obvious — for instance, a guy grabbing someone's arm to get their attention. Now, she's going to be startled, physically intimidated, and have her guard up. As you can imagine, she's not going to be too pleased to talk to him but the opposite can be bad too. For instance, if you're taking a picture with someone that you might like and doing the hover hands or if you're giving butt-out hugs, if you're trying to flirt with that person, this discomfort, this strangeness with physical contact can be a turn-off. Instead, create some kind of a physical connection with one-to-three-second touches like resting your hand on theirs or briefly touching their shoulder or at least a non-butt-out hug when you're greeting them. This gives them a chance to reciprocate if they like you back without crossing the line. Oprah Winfrey does this incredibly well and you can see more of her particular style in the video we did on her linked below. Finally, a surprisingly common way that women often get creeped out by men is when they make them feel trapped without realizing it. So in social settings like bars or clubs, men might make the mistake of trapping women by physically blocking their path to an exit. Perhaps, they're approaching a woman with her back to the bar or they sit at the outside of a booth while she's sitting on the inside pinning her between an immovable wall and themselves. Now, men don't often realize that they're doing this. Their physical size can be intimidating to women and they don't know what that feels like not to mention that at the onset, you're a stranger to this person — she doesn't know your intentions. So instead, to make women feel comfortable in these sorts of situations, position yourself so that you're the one against the wall — let her sit on the outside of the booth. The unconscious sense that she could leave whenever she wants, which is true, will actually make her more comfortable and more likely to want to stick around. Now, these are all super simple and quick fixes that will make a huge difference to prevent creepiness from ever occurring but if you want to actually exude confidence, attractiveness, I highly recommend checking out Models by Mark Manson. It covers the fundamental mindsets that lead to you being more attractive without having to change who you are. In fact, it's all about being more attractive by being more authentically yourself and it's probably the best primer that I can think of on the topic of flirting and dating and you can check it out today for free courtesy of this video's sponsor, Audible. When you go to audible.com slash charisma or text charisma to 500-500, you will get a free 30-day trial of Audible including one free audiobook and in this case, I would definitely recommend Models. You also get two Audible originals which are titles that are exclusive to Audible and if you decide to stay on, you get an audiobook every month after that which makes for an excellent chance to learn while you work out or you're on your way to work. Basically, time that might have been under optimized or wasted can go towards becoming the best version of yourself so I would definitely recommend checking out Models if flirting or dating or even being happier in a new relationship is important to you. And whenever I recommend this, people seem to love it so I'm happy to be able to offer it to you for free with your 30-day trial of Audible at audible.com slash charisma or texting charisma to 500-500. Either way, I want to thank Audible for making this animated video possible. These aren't easy to do. Also, thank you to the super talented Zeno, Guillerme, Eya, and Cody for making this animation come alive. This is content we've touched on before but it got this amazing fresh coat of paint thanks to their hard work and, of course, thank you to Audible for sponsoring.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Earning respect in Westeros often looks like this. Her children are b******s! Look at that. But in the real world, there are ways of gaining respect and power that are not about projecting strength but the truth of who you are. So in this video, we'll be using a dying man's speech to show how you can influence effortlessly and command respect for who you truly are. First, though, you need to understand the difference between force, manipulation, and power. In the context of this video, force is when you get your needs met by threatening, punishing, or incentivizing other people. This is the dominant mode of control that we see in Westeros, like when Daemon threatens the Kingsguard about joining Rhaenyra's cause. Do what you're told or get burned alive. People fall in line because that's not a deal they want to take. In our world, you see force at play often in the workplace with threats of firing or promises of reward if you do as you're commanded. The clear incentives of force make it extremely effective at influencing people quickly but loyalty only lasts as long as the threat or incentive does. As soon as the punishment or reward moves, the knives come out. A much more subtle form of control that lasts a bit longer is manipulation. Manipulation can involve outright lying to get people to act in your interests but usually, it involves sharing truths that make people do what you want while leaving out the parts that move them in a different direction. Otto Hightower lives in this realm as in the next clip where he's talking to Viserys about remarrying after his wife's death. He tells the truth in a way that talks Viserys out of marrying Lena Velaryon for duty but conveniently leaves out that his own daughter would be the next choice, improving Otto's standing immensely. I, uh, dearly loved my own lady wife. The pain of her passing still haunts me and to be compelled to replace her for duty's sake, you are the king but I do not envy you. When they're manipulating, people smuggle their needs into their advice to other people so they may try to convince you that something is in your best interest when their true motivation is to change your behavior to solve a problem in their life. Margaery Tyrell is an expert at this. Watch how she subtly convinces Tommen to move away from his mother while hiding that it was in her best interest and not necessarily Tommen's. It's so wonderful to have her watching over you, a lioness guarding her cub. Well, I'm a man now. But you'll always be her baby boy. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight. For most of our viewers, this is the most common form of control that you are likely to exert on and receive from others. It can look like a friend pushing you to stay out late and live a little rather than just admitting that they don't want to party alone. Or it could be you being super agreeable in a new relationship only to relax into your authentic self and create issues once you feel more safely connected. Now, you don't need to beat yourself up for this. Most of us have been socialized to get our needs met in this indirect way. But you do want to become aware of manipulative tendencies you may have in part because when people discover the self-serving nature of your advice, you lose respect and power, which is exactly what happened with Otto and Viserys. She was a calculated distraction. I only now realize how well calculated it was. That is an absurdity. Your interests no longer align with those of the realm. Your judgment has been compromised. The crown and the realm, both owe you a debt that can never be repaid. But I can no longer trust your judgment. Even if no one calls it out, though, when you manipulate, you train yourself to be indirect in how you meet your needs, which holds you back from true power. Now, true power is rare, especially in Westeros. It comes from revealing your needs and the truth of your experience without coercing anyone to meet those needs or to agree with your truth. This makes you disarmingly magnetic and this is what we see from Viserys at dinner. I wish you to see me as I am. Now, being open about your needs and your truth is easier to do when your authentic feelings match what people like to hear. We've covered this often on our channel. Being more upbeat, complimentary, and silly from a genuine place all make you super magnetic so don't stop. You've got fat. But when your truth is that you're in pain or a need that you have makes you feel weak, being open can feel much more challenging. So here's some guidance to become powerful and have people respect you for who you actually are. First, when beginning a tough conversation, perhaps about something someone close to you does that upsets you, share the complexity of your emotional truth. It's rare that tough feelings are all one thing or all another. It's often a mix of love and pain, hope and fear. Viserys begins by noting this fact. It both gladdens my heart and fills me with sorrow to see these faces around the table. Second, own clearly when you're asking someone else to behave in a way that makes you feel better. Unlike Otto or Margaery who try to smuggle their needs into what's best for the person they're speaking with, real power takes ownership of what it's looking to accomplish. It doesn't hide behind, this is what's best for you if that's not your deepest motivation. Viserys, again, states this clearly. If there is a situation where you may have a conflict of interest, say, in a sales position or trying to get your friend to stay out late as we mentioned before, you can own it and still use persuasive tools by saying something like, look, I'm biased because of this reason but I do think you'd benefit because... and then state things from their perspective. The point is to acknowledge how your advice meets your own needs so that the other person can make a well-informed decision about what's best for them and still trust your intentions. Third, power is most effective when it's consistent. A big reason Viserys' plea was ignored as soon as he left the room was because he spent a lifetime using force and manipulation. He demanded inauthenticity as to the parentage of Rhaenyra's kids, neglected his last three children even when Aemond lost an eye, and consistently threatened those around him. For power and vulnerability to move people around you, it can't just be a one-time thing so don't treat this as a strategy to immediately persuade others. Fourth, don't pretend your demands are requests which means that if you ask someone for something really sweetly but then rage when you don't get the answer you want, you are breaking this rule. Cristin Cole is a perfect example of this. He approaches Rhaenyra asking her to be with him in an apparently vulnerable showing. You could marry me. But when Rhaenyra denies him, he actively sabotages her children's training, antagonizes her new lover, and later crowns her half-brother king instead of her. Behind the facade of his vulnerable request was a demand and a threat. That is force and it leads to the bitterness that you see overtake Cristin. In order not to confuse demands and requests, our final point can be helpful which is to recognize that anytime you are obsessing over someone else's behavior or need it to be a certain way, you're giving your power away. This can happen with an interviewer hoping that you all get offered a job, a crush hoping that they date you, or even a family member hoping that they understand you. We obsess in those situations because we think someone else has the key to our happiness. And of course, it's true that other people's behavior can hurt or help you to feel good but the truth deep down is that many of the emotions we think other people inflict on us actually come from the way that we treat ourselves when triggered by other people's acceptance or rejection. For instance, Cristin was not wrong to be heartbroken as a result of Rhaenyra's rejection but what compounded that pain was the story he told about how he had nothing left. I took an oath as a knight of your king's garden, an oath of chastity. I've broken it. I've sold my white cloak. It is the only thing I have to my f***ing name. Cristin, like so many of us, could not feel who he was if it ran counter to the norms of his society. Because Westerosi custom said that he had no honor, he stopped feeling the honor that existed in his heart and could have remained in his deeds. Because his ego told him that he had nothing to his name, he overlooked all the wonderful experiences life had in store for him like the simple joy of the wind on his face as he sailed across the sea or just having really amazingly great hair. Congrats, Sir Crispin. Sir Crispin, wasn't it? Sir Cristin Cole, my prince. Ah, yes. Apologies. I couldn't recall. But this is the foundation of power. It's not having the great hair but it's the recognition of all that you currently have and are. Whereas force and manipulation believe that other people need to do certain things for you to be okay, power recognizes that other people can only trigger you to forget how okay you are deep down. When you take a deep breath, feel your heartbeat, and find your power, you will realize that being rejected does not make you unlovable. Being mistreated does not make you deserving of it. Being excluded from a group does not mean you must feel lonely nor does being accepted mean the opposite of all this. From a place of power, you'll wind up caring less about making people behave in this way or that way and more about expressing yourself authentically. You stop wanting people to see you in a way that pleases them and like Viserys, you truly mean. I wish you to see me as I am. Having the courage to meet your own needs, meet them directly, and thereby reveal who you truly are is the only way that people can respect you for who you are. Everything else is just people respecting or fearing your facade and though not every person is going to respond positively to the authentic you, in time, the people who don't respect you will filter themselves out creating space for those who do. And in time, both your inner and outer experience become supportive of your happiness. That is the essence of power and though it may feel highly uncomfortable at first, it can become the most effortless way to live once you get the hang of it. And if you're looking for more guidance on building social power quickly, you might like to check out our course, Charisma University.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Breaking Bad has one of the best character transformations in TV history. We watch Walter White go from a weak-looking pushover to a powerful presence who commands respect. A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks. While you definitely don't want to be like Walt in every way, there are four habits you can learn from him to look and feel extremely confident in any situation. You're goddamn right. And even though Breaking Bad is a scripted TV show, all the psychology covered in today's video will apply to your actual life. The first thing Walt did to stop looking weak was learn to project confidence with his body language. We see this for the first time when he stands up to a guy who's bullying his disabled son. I'll mess you up, man. Oh, you'll have one shot. You better make it good. What are you waiting for, your girlfriend? You better go. You better go. Take it. Take your shot. Even though the odds are against him, he projects that he's confident he's going to win. But be careful here. This is an area where you don't want to blindly copy Walt. You won't command respect by starting fights or taunting people. You'll just seem like a jerk. And you might get your ass kicked. What you can learn from Walt is his eye contact during conflict. Walt projects massive confidence because, in high-pressure situations, he holds eye contact. If you think that I am capable of doing this— Walt seems to have a pretty clear rule for eye contact during conflict. Don't break first. Here's an example. Stay out of my territory. Now, there's nuance to this. If you never break eye contact during conflict, you risk creating more hostility. In real life, any of these situations could easily result in you getting badly hurt. This is why most people make submissive eye contact, often breaking to look down, because they fear conflict. Walt originally had submissive eye contact, and you'll notice it gives you a very different impression of who he is. What's she talking about? Walt? If you want to diffuse tension without looking weak or creating more hostility, hold eye contact for three to four seconds and then break to the side instead of down. Beyond eye contact, actor Bryan Cranston has actually gone on record saying there was one small physical change he made to transform the impression you get of Walt. He simply stood with his shoulders back and his chest out. It seems like a small change, but those little tweaks to eye contact and posture give you a much more powerful presence. Beyond body language, you can also command more respect by changing how you speak. Part of what makes Walt look nervous early on is when he speaks very quickly, like here when he's nervous he'll get caught by his wife. Ditch it, man! Calling's sick! Listen, that is just not gonna work for me. I'm not interested in that at all and I would appreciate it if you don't call here anymore. Contrast that with these next two clips where Walt's more confident. He has a slow speaking cadence and uses pauses between words to hold attention. The pause is the moment when you're not speaking and, ironically, that's the moment that pulls people in. Specifically, if you pause at the moment people most want to hear what you have to say. In your position, I would have done the same. Jesse, you asked me if I was in the meth business or the money business. Neither. I'm in the empire business. Now, speaking like this is much easier to do if you genuinely feel confident. So, how can you actually be more confident in situations that normally make you nervous? And why is it believable to the audience that Walter White can go from a chemistry teacher with no confidence to someone who's able to stay confident while he's surrounded by gangsters ready to kill him? Why don't you start talking and tell me what you want? $50,000. $35,000 for the pound of meth you stole and another $15,000 for my partner's pain and suffering. If you haven't watched the show, Walt recently learned he has terminal cancer. Now that he knows he's dying, he feels he has nothing to be afraid of. It might not seem like it, but this is actually something we can all learn from, hopefully in a safer, healthier way than cooking meth. Because we're all going to die eventually. This is one of Stoic philosophy's most important teachings — memento mori — remember you will die. This isn't meant to depress you but to help you build Stoic courage to live life fully. If you remember your time on Earth is short, it can free you to take the risk, approach the beautiful person in the bar, ask for the promotion, quit the job you hate. Don't be reckless, but live the life you want while you have the chance. Building Stoic confidence can be as simple as setting a phone reminder each morning to meditate on memento mori for just a few minutes. Ask yourself, how would you live differently if you knew you were going to die in five years? What about one year? What about one week? You don't have to start living like you're going to die in a week, but it can help you find the confidence to prioritize what's important and stop putting off the life you really want to live. Now, while memento mori is the reason Walt can be so calm under pressure, that mindset alone wouldn't have helped him survive for long in the meth world. And especially after his cancer goes into remission, Walt definitely does not want to die. You see this in season 3, his life is threatened and he does not stay calm. If I could just talk to Gus, I know I can make him understand, please. If I could talk to Gus, I can convince him, okay? Just let me, please, please, please let me talk to him. Shut up! Shut up. The context here is that Walt's bosses have found a new meth cook. Now that they don't need Walt, they're going to kill him. But watch how the power dynamic shifts once Walt sends his partner, Jesse, to kill the new meth cook. Jess, what the hell was that? Exactly. You might want to hold off. Yeah? Why? Because your boss is going to need me. 6353 Wantebeau, apartment 6. This highlights the real reason Walt was able to be fearless for so much of Breaking Bad. He's irreplaceable. He makes the best meth and everyone knows it. You all know exactly who I am. Say my name. Eisenberg. You're goddamn right. It's Walt's confidence and his irreplaceable skill that give him power and respect in almost every situation. And while Breaking Bad is a fictional show, that dynamic is very real. If your employer or clients think you're irreplaceable, they'll do anything to keep you. This is true in a romantic partnership as well. The frustrating part for many people is what actually makes someone irreplaceable. It often doesn't seem fair. The hardest worker doesn't always get promoted and the nicest person doesn't always get the most dates. That's because for most people, getting what you want in life is actually a mix of two things — your ability and your ability to make people like you and respect you. That's the power of charisma. When you have it, the world suddenly opens up for you. If that's something you want, you may like our program Charisma University. It's a 30-day step-by-step guide to massively improving your charisma and confidence. Past members have said things like, I am way more confident now having gone through the daily action guides and I can see a big difference in the attention and respect that I get. It makes life so much more fun. I don't think it's an overstatement to say charisma is literally a gateway to getting anything you want in life, so thank you for making Charisma University. I don't have a bachelor diploma, yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills, which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured. Thank you so much for all that you have taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. Life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event that I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. The program is literally guaranteed to change your life. That means you can take the entire course and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund from right inside the program.

So in this video, we'll go through four habits you can steal from Chris that will help you to be charming in any conversation. And because Chris's charisma is so nice, we'll also go over a few nuances around flirting so you can create attraction as more than just a friend. Let's start with a couple of Chris's body language tricks. The first is to speak through a smile. This is a simple yet powerful way to influence how people perceive you. Here's a quick example where Chris gets asked about a Super Bowl afterparty. Did you meet Tom? Did you get to touch him? Because I know last time you were there, he said you didn't. Oh no, I've yet to meet him. He didn't go to the afterparty. I mean, he might have made an appearance, but he, you know, cut out Tom. He had to go rule the world. I didn't meet Tom. The key to a genuine smile is to smile with your eyes. When speaking through a smile, you'll likely notice a natural uptick in energy and movement as well. Here's another example where Chris is reacting to his Avengers clip on Seth Meyers. Notice when Seth and the audience laugh. Chris's words aren't especially funny, but he primes them with his smile, eyes, and tone. All right, I don't know much about it. I mean, I have one line in the clip. Like, typically when you come to a thing like this, you bring something to showcase, whatever. But they sent me the clip, and I was like, is this what I'm bringing to Seth Meyers? When people first try to build this habit, they make a common mistake of thinking you have to speak through a smile all the time. But the charm comes from being emotionally expressive, not from plastering a smile on 24-7. For example, watch Chris talk about Avengers Endgame and notice how he starts serious before ending by speaking through a smile. The scripts are so lock and key, but they had given me the scene where I pass the shield to Mackie. Oh, it's so nice to be able to say this. It's like therapy. I want you to lay down on the couch and just be honest. Let's talk about the Marvel secrets. Some people worry that their smile will come off as fake, and that's a great point to consider. While speaking through a genuine smile instantly makes you more charming, if the smile seems fake, it'll have the opposite effect. So don't try to put your biggest grin on for every conversation. Instead, try to guide the conversation to things that genuinely make you smile or laugh. The second body language trick you can steal from Chris is to own the space around you. The most basic way to do this is to use your hands when you speak, and Chris is fantastic at this. But beyond that, Chris does something you can steal to be charming even when you're not the one speaking. He takes up space when he laughs. Here's an example during an Avengers interview. And a lot of people are actually legitimately concerned, and they want to hear from you. If you watch most people in social situations, they look very spatially constrained. It's like they have an invisible box around them that they're scared to cross over. This subconsciously communicates to other people that you're nervous to draw attention to yourself, which instantly hurts how confident and attractive you look. This doesn't mean you have to manspread to assert dominance or anything weird like that. The simple act of taking up space when you laugh by throwing your head back or putting your hand on someone's shoulder is enough to show you're comfortable owning the space around you. Here's another quick example. Here's one more quick example. Notice the leg touch and side lean. In all three clips, you also saw Chris gives a small tagging touch to the person who made him laugh. These little platonic touches on the leg or arm are great in almost any situation. They're especially important in flirting because they let you calibrate your touch. If someone isn't comfortable with a touch on the shoulder, you know they won't be comfortable with you leaning in for a kiss. In addition to gauging comfort levels, going from a shoulder touch to a knee touch to an arm around the shoulder while you walk is an easy way to build increased physical comfort with someone. This is nice because even if a date went really well, it can feel awkward to lean in for a kiss if you spent the entire date with an invisible force field separating you. One side note about laughter in general, and specifically when flirting, don't try to force a big laugh at everything the person says. One of the cringiest flirting mistakes is to pretend that everything someone says is hilarious or fascinating. That fakeness will be a big turnoff to most people. Okay, so now let's talk about what to say. Whether you're flirting or just having a conversation with a potential friend, most people have one of two strategies. One is to tease the other person and give them a hard time hoping to make them laugh. The other is to be kind and complimentary all the time, hoping to make them feel good. The problem that most people run into is that if you only tease, you can come off as a jerk or even just someone trying too hard to entertain people. And if you're nothing but kind, you run the risk of being boring, or in the case of flirting, being put in the friend zone. What's unique about Chris is that he's comfortable bouncing back and forth between kind compliments and playful teases. This is often referred to as push-pull. Here's two quick clips so you can see how Chris balances the two. In the first, he's playing a game where he's meant to guess which Avengers cast member the photo is of. In this next clip, Chris is talking about which other famous Chrises he gets confused for in public. Chris Hemsworth is great at push-pull as well. Watch him go back and forth in this next clip while talking about Captain America. By bouncing between the two instead of just doing one or the other, you make yourself less predictable, which makes you more fun to talk to. You basically get the upside of both strategies and the downside of neither. It also makes you more attractive, especially if the person you're flirting with is someone who's used to people only pulling on them with a lot of compliments or flattery. Those are the people who are most likely to enjoy being playfully teased. But, like everything else, calibrate this to the individual person. Also, since Chris and Chris are just platonic friends, here are a few examples of more flirtatious push-pull. No, I don't. I don't. Where do we go? I have a gluten allergy, so I can't really eat. You have a gluten allergy? That's so unusual to hear from an actress. No, it's for real. You're freaking me out. I'm putting spells on you. Yeah, you've already done that. You did that when you did the knee. That's why you see me move back like that? You did. You're crawling away. No, no. The distance is hurting me. No, it's... Listen, it has to be. Fair enough. No, no. I'll just lean. I thought you were very sexy the first time I came on. I did, and then I found out you were sober, and I was like, oh, forget it. Oh, come on. The last thing we'll touch on is a mindset that will help you to make a better impression and feel more confident in conversation. Whether talking to a friend, boss, or person they're attracted to, most people try to present themselves as perfectly as they can and hide their flaws. Because of this, they become nervous about how they are being perceived. By contrast, watch Chris talk about his past work. Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you have to go ask people to come see a movie that you don't like? Well, yeah, if anyone... Yeah. I mean, if you can look at my IMDb page to know that that's happened. Rather than being nervous about how he's perceived as an actor, Chris just owns the fact that he's been in some bad movies. Here's another quick example of him talking about skydiving. When I was... I did it once when I was 20, and it was great, and you don't think twice, and you land, and you're like, I can't wait to do it again. And this time, I was terrified. I was really scared the whole time, and the second I landed, I was like, great, never again. Yeah. Admitting to being scared is something most men would try to avoid because they think it makes them seem weak or not masculine. Ironically, it's by being willing to laugh at yourself for your mistakes or fears that you show true confidence. It shows you're centered in yourself and unworried about other people judging you. In Nick's next clip, you can see in real time the impact of Chris being honest about an emotion most men would try to hide. Three, two, one. Oh, sh**. I panicked. Laughter. As soon as Chris laughs and admits he panicked, he gets a big laugh from the crew. By laughing, you show that this thing that would bother most people has no power over you. Now, whether you want to be charming because you're looking for a new mentor, more friends, or more dates, there's obviously a lot more to meeting someone than just what we've covered so far. You have to be able to confidently start a conversation, hook them in the first few minutes so that they want to learn more about you, and then build a real connection so they want to see you again. If you'd like a step-by-step guide that lays out how to quickly master those skills, you may like our program, Charisma University. It's the fastest way I know to become confident and charismatic. You can read all the details in the link below, but I figure the strongest way to let you know what it's about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So, here are a few things that CU members have written in. This first one is from a guy who joined after a breakup. He says, This next one is from a woman who works as a clinical psychologist. She says, So excited to be a member of Charisma University. And this last one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career. He says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma, yet they want me to fill this position, and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills, which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet, and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you have taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. You'll see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all had moments where we wish we could think of something funny to say but our mind goes blank. It sucks. So in this video, we'll go through easy ways to get a laugh in four different situations. When someone else is talking, when you get teased and need a comeback, when you're asked a question, and when you're telling a story. And rather than go through examples where you need to be insanely witty, these are purposefully some of the absolute easiest ways you can get a laugh. Do these consistently and people will love being around you. So the easiest way to get a laugh when someone is talking is by non-verbally overreacting to what they've said. Here's a quick example with Tom Holland. No, they don't give anyone the scripts. I did read the scripts. Did you? Yes, because they're not going to give you the script. Oh, don't walk off. Come back. This wordless walk off is stupidly easy, but it's surprisingly consistent at getting a laugh. Here's another example with Mila Kunis after Shaq says he didn't watch the LA Dodgers in the World Series. What's wrong with you? I'm a Yankees fan. If the walk off feels too over the top for you, you can also do a smaller non-verbal overreaction like Shaq here. I'm not like anti-gifts. I just don't over gift my child because... The next situation that people tend to go blank is when you're being playfully teased. Someone teases you and you want to banter back, but you can't think of anything to say. Let's look at a good example of banter with Kevin Hart. Watch how he responds after Charles Barkley tries to tease him. A thing in the show where you sit in the hot tub. Your body ain't that good when you can just walk around without your shirt off. First of all, if we're ever going to talk about bodies, I want you not to be the one to bring that conversation up. All right? If you don't get out of here shaped like a beanbag that got sat in. Did you notice that Charles didn't get a laugh at his insult, but Kevin did? That's because Chuck's was just a diss, but Kevin's was an appearance analogy, or said simply, a you look like joke. In your own life, generally avoid teasing something that's hard to change like weight or height. Instead, if someone teases you, fire back with a you look like joke about their clothes. It gets a laugh and isn't hurtful to the other person, like teasing a more permanent feature. Here's a quick example. Do me a favor, tell Chuck that nobody wear that many pieces in the suit no more. Chuck is dressed like a pallbearer. It helps tremendously to smile while you say it, so they know you're being playful. Unless you think that Kevin is the only one this works for, here's Shaq getting Kevin after Kevin tries to tease him. Give us Shaq these seven for one deals with these suits. These are group packages. There's no way these suits are sold individually. We do have to ask you. These you look like jokes about someone's clothes are fun, easy comebacks for any time someone teases you. They'll get a laugh and put you in control of the conversation, without actually offending the other person. Appearance analogies like this are an easy way to get a laugh in stories as well. Here's an example with Craig Ferguson describing a pro tennis player. He looked like a crab that had lost a fight. And you can see Will didn't laugh until the analogy. Now let's talk about one of the most awkward social situations for a lot of people, making small talk. For most people, making small talk means taking turns, asking boring questions and giving boring answers. A great habit for making small talk more fun and making people love talking to you is to get in the habit of giving an absurd answer. It's stupidly basic, but almost always gets a laugh. Here are a few quick examples and then we'll dive into how exactly you can do this. You may think this requires being quick on your feet, but the truth is most of us get asked the same questions over and over. For you, it may be where are you from or what do you do? The best thing you can do is think of the situations where you wish you could be funny, and then think of the three most common questions you get asked in those situations. Then come up with a go-to absurd answer for each one. You can improv any time you like, but this gives you an easy automatic joke to fall back on if your mind goes blank. Having watched thousands of hours of footage by now, I can promise you that your favorite charismatic celebrity definitely has go-to jokes and stories they repeat. It's okay if you do too. If you aren't quite sure how to craft a funny response, one fun framework is to purposefully misinterpret the question. Here's an example with Conan and Flula Borg. The last super easy way to make people laugh is simply to laugh as you tell a joke or funny story. The goal isn't to fake this, it's to focus on genuinely amusing yourself. This lets you take advantage of the psychology of contagious laughter. For example, in this next clip, notice that Kevin Hart initially tries to keep a straight face, but when Conan laughs, he can't help but laugh. In some cases, this is big, over-the-top laughter like with Conan, but other times, it can be as simple as laughing with your eyes, without needing to actually laugh out loud as you speak. If you want to learn more about that subtler laughter with your eyes, check out our video on George Clooney called 5 Easy Steps to Be Effortlessly Charming. I'll link to that at the end of this video. This next clip is the one that inspired this point. In it, Shaq is trying to stay mad at Charles Barkley for cutting him off, but watch how the laughter of the crew affects Shaq. Shaq tries to stay mad but can't because they're all laughing. You can see he starts to smile and laugh even though he doesn't want to. And there you have it, four simple ways to make people laugh and love being around you. If you want to learn more about how to make people love being around you, you may like our video program, Charisma University. We've had thousands of members join so far, and people often write in crediting the program for helping them get a new job or a promotion, new friends, and a better dating life.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all had those moments where we wish we could think of something funny to say but our mind goes blank. It can be frustrating, especially when you're talking to someone you really want to like you. So in this video, we'll go through four easy ways you can make people laugh and love being around you. We'll do this by breaking down some clips from the king of sarcasm, Ryan Reynolds. Some people mistakenly think this type of sarcastic humor makes you an a**hole but when done properly, it can instantly make people like you more. Let's start with the simplest habit you can steal from Ryan — exaggerate so much it's impossible to take you seriously. Watch this quick example after Graham Norton asks if Ryan was good with girls growing up. No, no, not at all. Oh, I don't believe it. No, no, no, I went through puberty at like 27. There's two situations where this type of joke is most useful. The first is when answering potentially boring questions during small talk. How old are your girls now? I have no idea. If you can transform someone's boring small talk into a funny, playful conversation, they will love you for it. That said, a common mistake with sarcasm is to say something potentially believable. This can leave people confused or even upset with you. By contrast, watch how obviously untrue Ryan's answer is in this Wired interview with Jake Gyllenhaal. You can tell Jake loves it. What does Jake Gyllenhaal... What does he eat? Well, funny you should ask — baby pandas. Now, you know the joke is coming which blunts some of its effect but in your own life, most people asking boring small talk questions won't be expecting you to give a funny response and when you do, you separate yourself as more fun than 95% of people who give a boring answer. In addition to answering questions, you can also use these over-the-top exaggerations to make people laugh during your stories. For example, listen to Ryan discuss working with a child actor for the first time. Um, you know, I was nervous. I mean, you know, when you're working with a child actor, the first thing you think is, I want to take my life with fire. Right. But, um, you know, there's that famous saying... This is especially powerful if you're being negative. In general, no one likes to listen to someone complain. By exaggerating how much he was dreading it, Ryan makes complaining fun to listen to. Here's another example from the same interview where Ryan talks about how the studio tried to get him and his 10-year-old co-star to bond. So they set up this day. We went out to the Museum of Natural History. She wanted to see the turtles and she drags me across the park, Central Park, all the way into F.A.O. Schwartz. I'm in there. I'm just longing for death. Uh, and, uh... Now, even if it's funny, if negative sarcasm is your go-to style of humor, some people may fatigue from your negativity. You can avoid this by ultimately ending your stories on a positive note. Watch how Ryan wraps up that particular story. And her mom walks up and she says, Ryan, um, bought me a, uh, a stuffed toy. It cost $300. What an idiot. And I was like, at that moment, I fell hopelessly in love with this little girl. Like, that's a smart kid. I'm kidnapping you and keeping you for the rest of my life. One thing you saw throughout that story that will help you make any joke funnier is specificity. For example, compare this next clip to if Ryan had just said his kids leave him feeling tired. F.A.O. is a challenge to kids. It's like, you know, I think of like blinking now is like tiny little breaks all day. Um, but, you know... If you're not good at this, an easy way to practice it is with the mind's eye method. Basically, when you want to make someone laugh, try to conjure up an absurd image in the person's mind. For example, Ryan was in a movie with Denzel Washington at one point who Ryan really admires. Instead of just saying he admires him, listen to how Ryan paints a fake funny image you can picture in your mind. But he knocks on my trailer and my dressing room door and he says, he says, you know, can I run this scene with you real quick? And I'm like, what? I'm ripping my Denzel Washington poster down. Like, yes, come on in. Here's a few more quick examples. Notice how he gets a laugh every time he replaces a generic statement like, they don't pay well with an absurd visual image. You care? After you make so much money, do you even care if it flops or not? How do you... I work for 20th Century Fox. What do you think I'm paid in spit and insults? This is an American-made gin. It's an American gin, a little smoother than its British counterparts, a little more drinkable. Wow, I sound like a pro. Yeah, you're actually good. I really know nothing about gin. If I ran the company, for real, it would be on fire. I used to say to her, I would take a bullet for you. I could never love anything as much as I love you. I would say that to my wife. And then the second I looked in that baby's eyes, I knew in that exact moment that if we were ever under attack, I would use my wife as a human shield to protect that baby. This type of witty humor may seem daunting at first because you have to be able to think quickly on the spot. But like any other skill, it gets much easier with a little practice. You can do that formally with improv classes like Ryan did, or you can do it informally simply by making it a priority next time you're somewhere social. If you're going to do the latter, you can set yourself up for success using priming. Simply put, if you know you're heading into a situation where you want to be witty, take just five minutes beforehand and watch someone like Ryan Reynolds, Chris Pratt, or whoever has the sense of humor you admire. This will help prime you to think like they do before you head out. The next technique you can steal from Ryan is the fake-out method. This is something you can do anytime you're telling a story, but it's especially easy if you're saying something that people expect will be sentimental. Watch this quick example of Ryan talking about how he became an investor in Aviation Gin. Eleven years ago, I remember reading a Deadpool comic and feeling like, this is a once-in-a-lifetime connection. And then a few years later, I met my wife and I was like, oh, I guess a once-in-a-lifetime connection can happen twice. And then we had our children and that's when I realized that I love gin. I took the passion. A nice trick, if you want to ensure you get a laugh, is to slow down or give a slight pause before the punchline. This lets whoever's listening to you start to fill in the blank incorrectly in their mind so they can be surprised by your unexpected twist. Here's another example. This time, Ryan is talking about how he gave Denzel Washington a black eye while filming Safe House. I banged his face very, very hard with my head, which for a young actor, that doesn't feel good. I didn't know what to do in the moment, you know. I didn't know if I should call for help, not for him, for me. Now, one common mistake people make when they're learning to be more charismatic is to put a lot of pressure on themselves to perform for other people. Ironically, the best thing you can do is to take the techniques from this video that you find funny and put those into practice. Ryan isn't just funny because of the words he says. He's funny because of his tone, his energy, and his body language. But rather than try to mimic all that consciously, it's far easier for you if you just focus on self-amusement and having a good time. If you do that, those subconscious signals will naturally improve. For example, listen to Ryan talk about how he got good enough at voiceovers to do the movie trailer for Deadpool. So you didn't just work on the things, you did the voiceovers for some of the trailers. Yeah, I did. The voiceover guy. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I love that stuff. I do it at home all the time. It drives my wife nuts. You know, it's that voice. In a world divided by fear. Depending on where you're starting from, being playful at all might feel like a stretch. So you'll have to start by going slightly outside your comfort zone. But ultimately, what you're aiming for is to find the style of joke that naturally makes you smile and laugh as you do it. This will make you have more fun in conversation and make people want to be around you more. The one piece of nuance to that is if you want people to like being around you, you're probably better off building the habit of being positive with your humor. For example, compare how Ryan and Jake react when this woman makes a joke that's just okay. Operation Jakey Jakes and Ry Ry. Oh, somebody's been reading my diary. And does my body language say anything about the line of questioning that may be about to occur? You've lost him, but you have me. He looks up and he's hydrating and ready to go. You see him? I'm just like... As you just saw, both positive and negative humor can make people laugh. But when you cultivate a positive, supportive sense of humor, it invites the other person to be more playful and continue to have fun in conversation. Make a habit of that and you'll become the person everyone looks forward to talking to. Now, making people laugh is obviously just one part of conversation. Whether you're looking for a new mentor, more friends, or more dates, there's a lot more to forming a connection with someone than what we've covered here. You have to be able to confidently start a conversation, hook them in the first few minutes so they want to learn more about you, and then build a strong enough connection that they genuinely want to see you again. If you'd like a step-by-step guide that lays out how to quickly master those skills, you may like our program, Charisma University. It's the fastest way I know to become confident and charismatic. You can read all of the details in the link below, but I figure the best way to show you what it's all about is to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few of the things that CU members have written us. The first one is from someone who was interviewing for a new job. They say, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I had hands-down the best interview out of everybody and that they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. This next one is a comment in the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their social and dating life. He says, Life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. And this last one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career. He says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma, yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills, which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you have taught me. You have truly changed my life because without Charisma University, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. You'll see more stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. I make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In this video, we're going to break down some clips of Robert Downey Jr. and Charlie Hunnam to highlight 4 different personality traits you may have that are psychologically attractive to a lot of women. We'll also go through how you can show you have these traits in a way that feels natural, rather than try-hard or braggy. You don't need every single trait in order to attract someone, this video is meant to give you a menu to choose from. Some come through in the stories you tell, others only require one sentence for you to establish. And yes, both these guys are handsome, but the techniques in this video will help anyone to be more attractive regardless of how you look. Also, it's worth noting, these are far from the only ways to be attractive. There are many other traits we can cover in future videos if this turns out to be a topic you're interested in. Okay, so the first trait is best shown through the subtext of a story. To learn how to work the story into conversation, watch how Charlie baits Kristen Bell to ask him to tell his attractive story. If it feels like you're forcing an attractive story into conversation, it's going to turn people off. That's why this method of story baiting is so effective. Now watch as he tells the story. Notice how he doesn't jump straight into how he saved the cat's life. You shouldn't rush to your punchline. Step one for good storytelling is to set the scene to get people invested in your story. Step two after setting the scene is to highlight the emotions you were going through. Storytelling isn't about describing what happened, it's about creating an emotional journey for your listener. One other quick tip if it's a dramatic story, then step three is to tell the story as if it's high stakes. Watch this. You know the cat survives, he just showed a photo of him. But he still tells the story as if the outcome is unclear. Now this next part is where you actually learn something about Charlie. The comedic timing at the end is great, but the most attractive part is the fact that he's a protector. He's willing to run two and a half miles to save a cat he just found. If he'll do that for a random cat, imagine the lengths he would go to to help a loved one. He highlights this trait again a few seconds later when he's not willing to take no for an answer. This isn't Charlie's only story that highlights this trait. On other talk shows, he's told stories of facing street hooligans and successfully fending off burglars. That willingness and ability to protect yourself and the people you love is attractive. Now that said, don't worry if you don't have any life experience like that, because this next attractive trait is extremely easy to show and it can be done by anyone. It's being a social leader. You may think demonstrating you're a leader requires being the captain of the football team or CEO of your company, but it's actually much easier than that. It's something you can show just by how you handle a conversation. Robert Downey Jr. is the king of this. There's three ways he demonstrates his social leadership. First, he's willing to be the first person to get playful in an otherwise serious setting. Second, he basically makes himself the director of any situation he's in. You may not feel comfortable being that assertive, and if that's the case, there's an even easier thing you can do to be a social leader. Take the focus of the conversation and then direct it to someone who hasn't had it. For example, watch Robert make sure to bring Robin in during his conversation with Howard Stern. You're leading the conversation because you're directing the focus, and because you're redirecting that focus to other people, especially people who haven't been able to grab it for themselves, you look better than if you were always shining the spotlight on yourself. Here's another quick example. In this next interview, Robert, Tom, and Paul had been doing almost all of the talking, so watch what Robert does when Jimmy asks Tom yet another question. And then Zoe got to talk for the first time. This method of being a social leader works for both introverts and extroverts since you don't have to keep the spotlight of the conversation on you. Here's one more example. The next attractive trait you can highlight about yourself, if you have it, is being a successful risk taker. This is another one that's best shown through storytelling. Let's look at another example with Charlie Hunnam. First, notice how he again uses the bait method to set himself up for a potential story. For context, Kristen just asked if he really rides a motorcycle or if it was just for the show Sons of Anarchy. Only once he sees that her attention is hooked does he dive into the story. It's the story of the one time in his life that he thought riding a motorcycle might get him killed. Did you notice that big pause? He purposefully waits a second before revealing all the details. This is a great trick to steal for high stakes storytelling. And again you see he's emphasizing the danger in the story. You know he survived, but telling it in this way draws people in. Being a successful risk taker isn't necessarily attractive to 100% of women because nothing is, but it's attractive to a good number of them. For some, it's because being a successful risk taker shows strength and a certain level of ability. For others, it's because it shows you have the confidence to bet on yourself to succeed when most people would be too scared, and others just find the danger of it exciting. Thankfully, most of us aren't riding 100mph on a motorcycle getting into collisions, so you may not have a story like that to tell. But being a successful risk taker doesn't have to mean you've taken life-threatening risk. It can be something like quitting a boring stable job to pursue your dream career, moving abroad by yourself, or having the courage to perform on stage. Any story where you had confidence to successfully bet on yourself is going to be attractive. Now that said, the point of the story can't be to highlight your best traits or it'll come off as braggy. You need to demonstrate them subtly as you tell a genuinely interesting story. If you don't have confidence in your ability to tell a good story, you may like this storytelling module from our program Charisma University, which I'll link to at the end of this video. Now, if you're really struggling to think of times you took a successful risk, there's another easy way to display confidence in conversation. Be playfully cocky. Here's an example from RDJ after getting asked a question at an Avengers press conference. We all know confidence is attractive, but arrogance is not. Being playfully cocky can build the attraction of being confident, while softening the risk of being arrogant. That said, some women will love this type of personality and others will not, so do it if it seems fun or if it suits you, but don't force it if this isn't your style. Robert Downey Jr. does two important things that help this go well. One, he goes so over the top with it that you can't possibly mistake it as serious. Watch this award acceptance speech to see what I mean. And if that's not obvious enough, he follows it up with jokes like this to let you know he's not actually taking himself that seriously. Here's one more example of Robert being playfully cocky, this time at the start of an interview. A big laugh and a playful smack is a great sign that you're doing this well. Now, whether it's telling stories with a flattering subtext or being playfully cocky, your biggest concern watching this is probably a fear that you're going to come off as arrogant. And it's definitely a fair concern. These tips are only meant to be part of the conversation, not 100% of it. Robert is playfully cocky, but he's also quick to compliment others. Watch this. And we've already talked about how Charlie Hunnam tells stories that have flattering subtext AFTER he baits the person into asking for it, but there's another thing he does. He mixes in stories where he's not always the winner. Also, another storytelling trick, listen to the hook he uses to start this story. For context, Kristen just asked him if he went to any school dances growing up. Similar to the bait method, Charlie hooks by making a statement that's high stakes but vague enough not to spoil the story. One thing you probably noticed, even when you know the story is going to end terribly for him, he still tells it in an attractive way. Speak slowly, not using filler words, good eye contact, this will give people the impression that even though a story didn't work out for you, you aren't embarrassed about it. Stories like that might not do much to help you build attraction by themselves, but if you mix them in with the rest of the tips from this video, it will help you make an attractive impression by showing that you're confident enough to do more than just share your victories. You can laugh at yourself and admit you have embarrassing stories from your past, which softens that potential risk of appearing arrogant. Now like I said before, if you want to improve your storytelling, you should check out our program Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program for building your confidence and charisma as quickly as possible and has an entire module dedicated to making you a captivating storyteller. Over 6,000 people have joined the program so far. Here's what just a few of them have had to say. First, life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. Another member wrote, My biggest breakthrough has been gaining more confidence. If you knew me a year ago, you'd see a socially awkward guy, but that same guy had hidden confidence and charisma that has now been unleashed. If you're reading this or listening right now, think about who you want to be in a year. This course will teach you how to be that person. And this last one comes from another guy who says CU helped his dating life. He says, Firstly, loving the course. I cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation module. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for over a year now, but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we're dating. The program comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is for any reason whatsoever. It's a 60-day guarantee even though the course is 30 days, just so there's absolutely no risk on your part at all. Either you become confident and charismatic, or you get every penny back.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Whether you realize it or not, negotiations are happening in your life all the time and they have a profound effect both in your personal relationships as well as the working world which is why, in this video, I want to give you a four-step system that you can use to maximize what you get out of any negotiation. But before you put this to use, we have to talk about where these negotiations are occurring because it's not just promotions and salary bump conversations. So the first place that these are likely occurring or they could be occurring is when an authority figure tells you that you can't. So for instance, my mom was planning to come visit me, she found out that her boss wouldn't let her so she can't come. Maybe for you, this is apparent. Whoever it is, when you're hearing you can't from an authority figure, a bell should go off. That is an opportunity to negotiate. Similarly, if you find that you're in conflict with someone that you love, you don't want to be in conflict with them, oftentimes, we get into divvying up and arguing and who's wrong, this is an opportunity for a negotiation to create more for both sides. And generally speaking, the third area is whenever you feel like you don't have enough. You don't have enough time, you don't have enough money, there's no one to blame. Oftentimes, there is someone who could help you if you go to them to negotiate. So in the back of your mind, as I go through these four steps, pick a situation in your life that's been bothering you. You don't feel like you have enough, you can't, whatever it is, and keep that in the back of your mind as you apply these steps. So four steps, the acronym here is ROLLS, five letters, because the first step is REAL OBJECTIVE. That is to identify what your real objective is prior to entering into a negotiation. When we get heated, we dig into specific positions. So if there's a husband and a wife and they're arguing about where they're going to spend the holidays, he says his family, she says hers, they dig in, right? He's got to go to his family, she's got to go to hers, there's no common ground. But if they took the time to identify what the real objective is, it probably has to do more with the feeling. Maybe the husband just doesn't feel comfortable around her family, doesn't want to spend the holidays with the in-laws. And maybe she feels like she's got a short vacation and she'd like to see her family for some of it. When you identify your real objective, you can already start to see that there's much more overlap between what two parties want than is always or sometimes available at the first blush. So for both yourself and for the person who you're anticipating speaking to, what are your real objectives? What are your real emotional objectives? And one that you definitely want to write down if you're doing this for the other person is that they want to be validated, they want to feel important. If you exclude that from the negotiation, you're probably going to have it blow up in your face. So that's the first thing, real objectives. Second thing is to make a list of all of the ways most creative possible that you can get your objectives. So let's say you're the husband here, right? You don't want to see her family. Well, you could go anywhere, right? You could go anywhere in the world. You don't have to go to your family's house, you could go to Florida, you could take a different vacation, you guys could split up, you could go visit her family, but if there's just one member that you don't want to see, you could go to a different part of the party, a different room, whatever it is. Get creative. How can you get your real objective? And do the same thing for this person, right? What's all the ways that they can get their real objective? You're going to be hypothesizing what their real objective is here when you're doing this list but when you speak to them, you'll make this concrete. For now, though, as you're thinking this through, circle the ones where you both can get what you want and they can get what they want and there's some parallels there, right? These can work in the same universe. So that's the second step is you're going to list this. The third step is that you need to fall in love, right? And what you need to fall in love with is your no-deal option. A lot of people go into negotiations from a position of weakness and that weakness is that they need to make a deal. They need that husband or that wife to come to their in-law's house so they're automatically on the back foot because they have to convince someone, a free and autonomous being, to do what they want and that's where they get to threatening and manipulating, and you didn't do this last time. You have to fall in love with the no-deal and recognize that even in personal relationships, it's possible to spend a holiday apart, right? If you ask your boss for a promotion and you don't get it, you can always not get the promotion. You could work somewhere else, you could decide to work harder, whatever it is. Imagine a scenario where this person doesn't give you what you want. What is still within your control and what can you do with that? So just to give you a concrete example, the best negotiation of my entire life was when I was leaving my job in consulting and I wanted to get out of this particular job for a long time and what I thought my objective was, was to get a job in New York City because I currently had one in Washington DC. And as I was applying and applying for these jobs, I wasn't getting it. I felt like I couldn't, I was stuck. There wasn't enough time, all of the things that I said at first were in play. But as I dug into my real objectives, I realized what I wanted to do was not to get any one of these particular jobs, I wanted to live with my friend. And so when I wrote down all the things that could work, I said, well, one, my friend could move to Washington DC, right? I didn't have to go to New York City. Secondly, I didn't necessarily have to have a job, I just wanted to live with him and technically, if my real objective was to live with him, I could move there and then get a job. And when I started doing this, all of these possibilities opened up as I listed this, I could work remote, I could do all these things, and of course, I did that for the other person. But what I had to fall in love with was recognizing that, okay, what is in my control is if I leave this particular job, not if they agree to a remote work arrangement because when I've gone through the two lists of things that could work for me and I wrote down, okay, here's what it is and things that might work for my current employer, remote work arrangement was in there but they didn't have to give it to me. So really getting to the state where before I spoke to the president of the company, I sat down and went, okay, imagine if he says, no, can you fall in love with the prospect of just leaving this particular job to move to New York City, figuring it out on your own? And I did, I imagined how good it could be and how resourceful I'd have to be and I came up with all these other opportunities to find other jobs and to earn money so that when I did sat down with him or did sit down with him, I was doing so from a position of honest power. If you don't fall in love with your no-deal option, you do not have power in a negotiation and believe it or not, it's when you don't have power in negotiation that all these dirty tactics come out that you start manipulating, being dishonest, and being underhanded. When you have genuine power and you don't need someone to move, you don't have to be dishonest, you don't have to manipulate them, you can just be completely transparent in the conversation. And that takes us to the fourth step, the S in roles, which is to speak this entire process out loud to the person. So when I sat down with the president of this company and I said, look, here's what I've been thinking about, I went through, okay, I realized something is not working, real objective. It's not that there's anything wrong with this job, it's not that I want another job, it's that I want to live with my best friend and he doesn't live in this city and I'm not happy here so I explained my real objective to him. I also said, I recognize that you guys probably, it would stink to lose a team member at this point, right? You guys wouldn't want to have to retrain someone and I recognize that that would be a bummer and I also, recognizing his other real objective to be appreciated, appreciate all of the training that you guys have done for me so far. Truly, it has been great. Okay, so I spoke that entire first step to him. I said, then I went to the list area. I said, okay, I've been thinking of ways that this could work out. I don't know if these are good for you but I could move to New York City and work. I could just leave and maybe come back once to train a new hire. Whatever it is, I want to make this work for you because, and then I did the L, whether or not we can sort of come to an agreement here, my heart is set on this and if I have to, I would just move to New York City without a job. So I spoke the entire process out to him and when he heard that and I was honest and transparent and I had his needs in mind because this process included his needs, he came back to me and started solving my problems. And what he said was, well, look, we don't want a lot of people to follow in your footsteps and start leaving for remote work arrangements after one year of work but what we could do is make you a contractor. And as a contractor, you lose health benefits, you lose the ability to... we can't guarantee you employment past this project but you'll continue to go on and you could actually get more money working remote because contractors get paid more and that is what wound up happening. I moved to New York City, I had a remote work arrangement for six months before the project ended and I lost the job because I was a contractor but the point is by simply speaking this out to him, it got him on my side. He actually came up with the solution of contractor because I had been so transparent in my process. So that's the final step is to speak this process and work with them. I want to give you three do nots while you're actually engaging in this negotiation process that people always do wrong. First one, do not bluff. A lot of times, people come in from positions that aren't truly powerful. They're not happy with the no deal and so what they do is they threaten that, you know what, then I'll go to my parents and you go to your parents and when they get that, they're upset about it and they're bitter about it or they threaten, you know, if this doesn't work out, I'm gonna have to leave the job. The boss says, okay, sorry to hear that. Now they're out of a job so do not bluff. You want to rather take the time to fall in love with the no deal step. That's a bad thing to do if you do it the reverse way. The second thing that you never want to do is you never really want to screw the other person. I see this in negotiations. People are constantly thinking that there is a fixed pie and that the goal is to have this 100% pie and take 80% of it for yourself while leaving the other person with 20%. This is the wrong mentality. First off, if you do that, they're going to drag their feet in the execution phase. While I was researching this video, I spoke to people who were negotiating in relationships and I heard a story from one person, rather it was through the grapevine, about one person who negotiated that their boyfriend would come to a concert with them. And what happened was she negotiated, she got him to come, and he was so miserable and upset in this concert that she wished he wasn't there at all. So don't push people over a barrel, get them to do what you want. If they're not happy with the deal, you're in trouble. And a better way to think about this pie where you're trying to get 80 and 20 is rather than dividing up a pie that has 100 units, go bake a new pie that has 150 units and then everybody can get more. That's the whole process of creating this list. And then the final thing is to recognize, coming back to the no deal, is that your relationship does not need to be contingent upon you agreeing and forming a deal all the time. Now this is particularly an issue in relationships though it can be the case in the working world. When I left this job, I actually improved my relationship with the people there because I didn't make the relationship that we had contingent upon us agreeing in this particular area. If you're arguing about where you're going to get dinner or where you're going to go for any sort of vacation, the relationship that you have does not require you to agree all the time and the more you can get used to having negotiations, coming to a no deal solution, and not being mean, vindictive, or manipulative about it and just splitting up for a period of time, I tend to believe the stronger the relationship will be because you don't have to cajole, coerce, and make two people behave as a single unit all the time. So that is an overview, hopefully, a helpful one of how to negotiate. Obviously, all of this is going to be much more useful if the other person likes you. If you've got rapport, it's going to count for a lot more. So if you're interested in learning about how to create rapport, you may be interested in our course, Charisma University. Charisma University is a step-by-step guided program that is guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in 30 days and it's structured with a daily action guide so you don't have to guess when it comes to learning these habits. You follow the guide and you get the results. Now you can read all about the details in the link below but I figured the best way to let you know what this is all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written in via email or in the course comments. Now the first comes from a woman who just got back from a speaking tour. She says, Last year, I joined CU right before two public speaking events. Though I didn't do anything too terribly embarrassing while on stage, my lack of confidence was obvious to everyone in the room. Fast forward to this weekend, I owned the stage and spoke to over 2,000 business owners. It was so powerful that even my marketing assistant was completely lost for words. Now this next one comes from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I, hands down, had the best interview out of everybody and that they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. Thanks so much for creating Charisma University. This is a game-changer. That changed how I approach my boss, my peers, and strangers. It gave me the guts to stand up for myself and others, start a business, and engage with others. Even after the 30-day program, I still feel like there is so much track to run on and I am just getting started. Now you'll see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course and if you do, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all and it's 60 days even though the course only takes 30 to complete because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value out of the course. So if you'd like to check the course out, go ahead, click the link on screen now or below in the description. We have had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it. I'd love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 787}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"If you're an introvert, you may think that you're destined to suffer socially but one of today's most popular celebrities is a self-proclaimed introvert. I think they know this but I'm a very shy introverted person. Even more amazing, Zendaya captivates people without pretending to be extroverted which can feel exhausting and fake. So today, you'll learn four easy tricks to be charming as an introvert without changing your personality. Our writing assistant and resident introvert Hadley will walk you through them. Take it away, Hadley. So the first mistake some introverts make in conversation is forcing themselves to be outgoing all the time. Doing this will drain your social battery fast. So instead, learn to front load your enthusiasm. This means using your social energy in the moments that matter most, entrances and introductions. For example, watch how Zendaya starts this interview. Now this doesn't mean you need to go dancing into every room. You can do this by being a big hugger or even just a big smiler. Bring energy and enthusiasm to those first few minutes of conversation and later you can transition to whatever energy level feels natural to you. Now, when you do become a bit lower energy, it can be tough to get a word in over those louder extroverts. But there's a trick you can use to get people to listen to you without raising your voice. Use hand signals to capture attention. We talked in the past about how Keanu Reeves will move his hands a few seconds before he speaks to grab attention despite his quiet voice. Zendaya does a variant of this to stop people from cutting her off. She holds her pointer finger up to show that she's not done speaking. Doing this, this, this, this thing where I'm basically up in the air and I spin down and I get caught and I heard a fart. Now wait! We all heard the fart. Hold your pointer finger up while pausing mid-sentence and you can really captivate people without needing to be loud. Here's a great example you can model from Steven Yeun. I think he started doing that because of you though. This simple trick can help you captivate people and avoid getting cut off without needing to raise your voice. So now that you've got their attention, let's cover a super easy trick to make people enjoy talking to you even more. And that's speak through a smile. Watch how endearing Zendaya is as she smiles while she speaks. Did the new movie, he speaks English and it weirded everybody out. Yeah. Did you know that Nanny Pot was gonna be a thing? Now if you're not the talkative type, you can still make people love being around you just by being a likable listener. One fantastic habit for making conversation more fun for yourself and for making people like you, is to listen with the intention of laughing. Zendaya laughs easily in conversation and it makes the people she's talking to feel amazing. Madrid is also in Spain, right? Slytherin. All day. Sometimes the thing that makes people like you most is not when you are funny, but when you make them feel funny. Watch how Tom can't help but smile as Zendaya cracks up beside him. Oh my, it's definitely- You'd have to take avocados. Yeah. You'd have to, like from a pure logistical standpoint, it'd have to be avocados. Yes. If you've ever had a friend who laughs at literally everything you say, you know how amazing this feels. Now, one quick warning. Never fake a laugh. Doing this will backfire and make people immediately distrust you. If you've ever suspected someone of faking a laugh around you, you've probably felt like this before. She's got a fake laugh and a real laugh. They are very close. Yeah. And it took me one day of working with her when I was like, that's bullsh**. Like I literally was like, I wasn't that funny. So rather than fake laughter, you want to cultivate the ability to laugh freely whenever you do find something funny. If you currently struggle to laugh when you're in conversation, that's totally fine. Laughing is a habit that gets easier the more you do it. So a good practice is to watch something you know will make you laugh right before going out. This prime will help you be in a better state to laugh when you're actually in conversation. And that's four tricks to be charming as an introvert. Now, if you enjoy these videos, but find it hard to put it all into practice when you're actually in conversation, you may like our program, Charisma University. It takes just 20 to 30 minutes a day, and each day comes with a daily action guide so you know exactly how to put what you're learning into practice. If for whatever reason you don't like the program, you can get a full refund just by pushing a button inside the course. I could go on and on about the program, but rather than tell you what I think, let's take a look at what some of the members have said about their experience after the program. Thank you, you changed my life. It's so much easier for me to connect with people. All my relationships have improved and I'm able to make new friends anywhere and in any situation. I never expected such remarkable outcomes from a simple online routine. This course completely changed my mindset on how to approach people and think about myself. It has undoubtedly made a significant impact on my life.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Four and a half years ago, I made a video predicting that long-shot candidate Trump would beat Hillary Clinton to become president. I talked about how he had better slogans, better media strategy, and better zingers. I am not making that same prediction this year because Trump's campaign savviness is nowhere near where it was in 2016 but, in my opinion, the race is not as far apart as the polls show and the messaging in this final stretch could turn the tide. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen two more beatable candidates than I did in the first debate, which is why, in this video, we are going to cover the persuasion, political strategy, and dirty politics Trump could use to beat Biden. I also want to show how Biden can use the same to counter Trump and put him away. So don't worry, no matter who you support, there will be something to love and hate in this video. Before we begin, none of this analysis has to do with policy. Furthermore, these are the moves that I believe could win the election for each side but it doesn't mean that doing whatever it takes to win is honest or that it's the right thing to do. Some of this is dirty politics. So let's start with Trump's position coming into the election. He is down in the polls and between coronavirus, civil unrest, and tax returns, there are a lot of attack vectors that he has to face but he isn't the first incumbent president to have a difficult road to re-election. Back in 2004, George W. Bush was in just as bad a spot, if not worse. He was going up against John Kerry after leading the U.S. into Iraq under pretenses that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction. But that turned out to be totally bogus just in time for his re-election campaign. The president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception. So how did Bush win again despite plunging America into an unpopular war that since then has cost over $2 trillion? Well, he changed the frame of Kerry's attack. Instead of addressing Kerry's criticism that he misled the nation into war, Bush often framed Kerry's criticisms not as being about the decision-making but about the American troops in combat. And now, there's 30 nations involved standing side by side with our American troops and I honor their sacrifices and I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave, brave soldiers. You cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us. As our troops fight a ruthless enemy. He repeated this message often. Determined to destroy our way of life, they deserve to know that their elected leaders who voted to send them into war continue to stand behind them. And it worked. It was close but Kerry was unable to effectively hold Bush accountable for his decision-making. Instead, Bush made Kerry come across as wavering in his leadership of those troops. Now, Trump has the opportunity to reframe incoming attacks in the similar manner. Instead of responding to the criticism of his leadership during the pandemic and the subsequent civil unrest, he can frame Biden's attacks as a critique of doctors or first responders or Fauci. I'll repeat again that this isn't the moral move but in researching past elections, I can't deny that it has worked. Bush won. If Trump does this or anyone in your life mischaracterizes your criticisms of them, a very effective technique to counter is to predict the dodge. Imagine while you're giving the criticism that you expect the other person to dodge the issue in their response. When you call this out in advance, it makes the dodge much more obvious to the audience and tougher to pull off. Had Kerry done this, it would have greatly improved his odds of being president and if Biden combines this with the strategy that he had in the first debate of speaking directly to the audience via the camera, it can make dodging criticisms much more difficult to do. But, of course, this isn't the only reframe that made Bush win and it's not the only thing that Trump could do which brings us to our second point. Trump has a huge opportunity to attack Biden as a political opportunist. The Bush camp frequently did. Take, for instance, this joke from Mitt Romney with Bush by his side. He's been on both sides of most issues. He's been on both sides of what to do in Iraq. He's been on both sides of how to deal with free trade, both sides of the gay marriage issue more recently, and he wondered whether he could pick someone with views different than his own. He selected himself to do that. Biden, like Kerry before him, has a long public record that has him on both sides of many issues, and sometimes those positions changed following American culture rather than leading it. Let's try to avoid nuance, Senator. Do you support gay marriage? No. Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage. We do not support that. Men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying men are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And, quite frankly, I don't see much of a distinction beyond that. Trump can hit Biden here with the same criticism that Bush had for Kerry—that his positions are held from political convenience and not of internal strength, and, therefore, nobody really knows what he thinks, only what he'll say to get elected. Now, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often because he does. You know, for a while, he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein. He saw the wisdom until the Democrat primary came along, and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions. Trump effectively used this frame to put away Lion Ted, as he called Ted Cruz, in 2016. So how could Biden respond? First off, with almost any insult that isn't completely fabricated, you don't want to fight within the frame that has been dictated by your opponent. You don't say that you haven't changed your mind like Kerry did. I've never changed my mind about Iraq. I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat. I always believed he was a threat. Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president. I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary. And you don't deny being a political insider like Hillary Clinton did in 2016. I cannot imagine anyone being more of an outsider than the first woman president. I mean, really, let's think about that. Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. Instead, you reject your opponent's frame. In this case, Biden could reject the frame that changing your mind in light of new data is a bad thing. He could reframe flip-flopping to being mature enough to update his worldview in light of new evidence. And even if Biden responds like this, this is going to be a contentious point which is why it's still a good angle for Trump. And that takes us to the third point — each candidate needs to dictate the core issue that this election rides on. And the core issue needs to be one that satisfies two goals. First, it automatically feels like you win because it's undeniably a strength. And second, it needs to galvanize undecided, uninspired voters. Candidates sometimes make the mistake of choosing a core issue simply because they're stronger than their opponent there, neglecting that undecided voters and those who may or may not show up are not emotionally connected to every issue. So both sides need to avoid what I call red herring attacks. These are attacks that feel like wins in a debate but they don't win more votes. For instance, the electorate has already accepted that Biden does not appear as high energy or vibrant as Trump so it's a waste of time for Trump to push the point. Similarly, the electorate expects Trump to do everything that he can to reduce his taxes — that's who we think he is — so it's a wasted attack lane for Joe Biden. Bush Jr. understood this and he focused on the one important issue that his personality conveyed more than Kerry's — steadfast firmness to keep America safe from terrorism. All progress on every other issue depends on the safety of our citizens. The most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. If our country shows any uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. This is not going to happen on my watch. And of course, with this framing, it led to Bush being the only reasonable choice. I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics. Be consistent when you're the president. There's a lot of pressures and you've got to be firm. So let's start with Trump. What is the core issue that can emotionally inspire the uncommitted electorate to vote for him? Now this might be contentious so let me know in the comments if you disagree but my read is that it's what his recent executive order called the scapegoating of any race. His strongest position is to stand against critical race theory ideology that teaches that white people or any people are inherently racist or inherently contributing to the oppression of others. He can frame the issue not as a pushback against diversity but against any ideology that treats skin color as a determinant of one's character, competence, or culpability. I believe that he wins the election if he makes this the key issue and takes a strong stance. For Joe Biden's part, I believe that he really needs to avoid focusing on several red herring attack lanes, taxes, accusations of fascism, the Affordable Care Act. These are unlikely to bring out any new votes or rile his base to get out on election day. The issue for him needs to be something that hits the heart of America emotionally much like Bush did with safety and in Biden's case, that sole issue should be the year 2020. All he needs to do is ask Americans how 2020 has been for them under Trump's leadership and funny enough, after I wrote this, he did so in the first debate. If Biden wants to ensure a victory, I believe he needs to spend more time here and a particularly strong attack for him is around the word chaos. The angle if I were advising him is that Donald Trump is very good at ensuring that he personally thrives in the chaos that he creates, it's just that everyone around him doesn't. This will resonate given all the high-profile firings and arrests that have been made in his inner circle. Now, before we get to our last point, I want to show how easily Biden can defuse one of Trump's red herring attacks just because this is an awesome moment in election history around Ronald Reagan. Reagan was the oldest candidate in the history of the U.S. and he stumbled over some of his words inviting speculation into cognitive decline. Does that sound familiar? The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said. So rather than trying to explain all this away in the second debate, Reagan took a much stronger route. He joked it away like this. I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience. That was it. Mondale has since said that he knew in that moment that Reagan had won and keeping his characteristic sense of humor up, Reagan continued to joke about this throughout his presidency. One of my favorite quotations about age comes from Thomas Jefferson. He said that we should never judge a president by his age, only by his work. And ever since he told me that, I've stopped worrying. Just to show you how youthful I am, I intend to campaign in all 13 states. Donald Trump used a similar tactic in 2016, completely defusing an early attack on his treatment of women and you might remember this moment. You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals. Your Twitter account... Only Rosie O'Donnell. Just a reminder that literally responding to every attack isn't always the best political play. Nothing makes people move along like a joke that can get them to burst out in laughter. The same is true in your life but we have other videos for that that I can link to at the end if you're interested to learn more. But the last point here for both Trump and Biden, they both need to speak in sensory language. That's because words that create images, sounds, and feelings in people's minds are much more likely to move them emotionally. So the candidates must ensure that people have sensory images in their head both in their criticisms of the opponent and in their vision for the future. A key component to get an image in someone's head is specificity. Compare John Kerry here talking in abstractions. That was the objective. And if we'd used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq and right now Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead. That's the war against terror. To Barack Obama, who, funny enough, was campaigning on Kerry's behalf at the time but much more effectively. Workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay $7 an hour. So Trump needs to paint a picture of a prosperous 2021 under his leadership — images of Americans healthier and happier than they've ever been, smiling in surprise at the performance of their pension funds rebounding from a difficult year. Now, we saw a bit of this in the first debate but he will need more. Joe Biden needs to paint a similar prosperous vision of 2021 under his leadership but I believe even more important is that he described the suffering in 2020. He asked a few questions that conjured visuals in the first debate but the more he does of this, the more he makes Trump feel like the worst choice. The following example is not nearly broad enough so Biden needs to paint a picture for the people who don't know someone personally who has died but who still have suffered in their mental or economic health. You folks at home, how many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you were in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them? You had a nurse holding a phone up so you could, in fact, say goodbye. His own CDC director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year and he held up and he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. So, now, for the moment of truth, the prediction. Four years ago, when Trump had just won, I bet my brother that he would, for sure, be a two-term president. I wasn't even sure who the Democratic candidate would be, I just couldn't imagine anyone beating Trump's media genius and if you're not sure what I'm talking about, definitely watch the videos that I made on him because his approach is fascinating and far deeper than most people give him credit for. But this year, I have been very surprised at how Trump has bungled campaign opportunities that I think he would have knocked out of the park in 2016. So while I think that both Trump and Biden could still lock it up with the strategies that I laid out in this video, my guess is that Biden will win simply because neither candidate is killing it charismatically and it's been a rough year for most Americans. If my thoughts change prior to election day, I'll update you but that is my guess for now. One thing that you might not know is that I've actually been talking about politics as well as charisma and philosophy for a while on our podcast channel and if you feel like you learn new things here on Charisma on Command, you will probably really like the podcast. We chat about how to be a happier, wiser, and more thoughtful person and the comments and reviews that we're getting are even more enthusiastic than the ones that I see here and I'm genuinely touched by how many people say that it is their new favorite podcast. I'm going to link you to a recent episode that people said was one of our best so just so you can get a taste, you can click here to check it out. Also, a reminder for those of you who didn't see our R-rated OnlyFans video, Ben and I will be personally matching donations to Charity Water through the link in the description. It's a birthday campaign and if you want to help someone who doesn't have clean drinking water and have your contribution go twice as far because I'll be matching donations, take a look at that link. We've raised water for 3,400 people and I really appreciate all of you who have donated for that. Thank you so, so much. Either way, I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 937}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Geralt of Rivia, from The Witcher, is a man of few words but despite his quiet nature, he is an absolute beast and we see that not just through his swordsmanship but through Henry Cavill's commanding physical portrayal of Geralt. And that's why, in this video, we're going to be breaking down four body language tips that you can use to instantly make your body language come across as more confident. We'll be comparing and contrasting to what you might see in the animal kingdom since the word beast didn't just crop up out of nowhere. So the first thing that you see from Geralt is that he has slow, languid movements. And when he isn't in a fight, he's almost never in a rush. Very scary looking swords. I know who you are. This is true not only of Geralt's larger movements but also as to how quickly he responds when he's spoken to. Leave. To Miriam. Never return. This even extends to how long Geralt blinks. The guy is a slow blinker compared to most. Now, this slower motion can be contrasted with the herky-jerky movements that you might imagine when you're feeling awkward, embarrassed, or otherwise nervous. And it has parallels in the animal kingdom into two styles which, broadly speaking, can be categorized as predator movements and prey movements. Predator movements are carefree, slow, and relaxed much like Geralt. Prey movements are more rapid and jerky and the difference comes from the different realities that they live in. Predators can afford to move more slowly because they don't need to be constantly fearful. So when you can move slowly and comfortably, it sub-communicates to other people that you do not feel scared or pressured and, in most circumstances, that is going to be perceived as confidence. Now, we do need to consider that confidence can also show itself in expansive explosive movements. So rather than being just slow or just explosive, deep confidence is about being able to move at a pace that is self-determined rather than environmentally determined. So identify the direction that you tend to go when you're feeling nervous. Is it hyperactively sped up or is it locked down and more hesitant? If it's the first, for instance, when you're talking to a higher-up or a person that might make you feel nervous, take a deep breath and open up your body language in that situation to give yourself a chance to slow down. If, on the other hand, you shrink and get more quiet in those circumstances, take a few quick breaths to energize yourself, maybe even stretching your arms to extend your comfort zone. Either way, the goal is to break out of a fearful pattern into one that feels more comfortably energized. In the same vein of predators and prey movements, you see that Geralt usually has people's eyes on him while he is very comfortable turning his back on others, even those who are supposedly a threat to him. Now, when it comes to animals, turning your back on something is a sign that that thing is both unthreatening and, for the time being, unimportant. And it's why you might see lions grabbing a drink at a watering hole while zebra gather behind them but never the reverse. If the lions aren't hungry, the zebra don't really matter to them but the lion always matters to the zebra. Now, you might think that because of this, the confident powerful move is going to be to turn your back on people and it is true that in life, the person who ends a conversation and walks away is usually the one with more power in a given situation but that doesn't mean that you want to start using this as a technique because what gets received by the other person is they are unimportant like the zebra. And, unfortunately, Geralt kind of lives like this. ...that would make the sun itself blush with a single comely smile and rivers of the sweetest of drinks from the rarest of... So the most confident and social thing that you can do in modern society is to not be like Geralt in this case and, instead, give people the opposite of a back turn. So when someone enters a room, you could turn your head and wave but warmer is to stand up and greet them head-on with a handshake. Similarly, if there's someone on the periphery of a conversation at a networking event, turning to bring them into the circle shows that you can both read these cues and are a leader enough to incorporate someone new. And this brings us to our third point and I'll admit that this one isn't totally body language but it's close and it's that confident people and powerful animals can afford to handicap themselves from a survival perspective. So before we get back to Geralt, ask yourself, why does the peacock have its feathers? They provide no obvious benefit to the peacock's survival and can even turn out to be a hindrance when escaping predators. Well, one theory is the handicap principle. The peacock's feathers are attractive to other females because they hurt the male peacock's survival chances which means that only a strong peacock can support such a waste from a survival perspective. Not optimizing for its own survival signals just how fit that peacock really is. Consider then this moment from Geralt who tells the truth despite it harming his own reputation. There was no slaying. I had my ass kicked by a ragged band of elves. I was about to have my throat cut when Filavandrel let me go. And paradoxically but totally in line with the handicap principle, in this case, it is received as a confident move. Any man willing to paint himself in the shadow of his failures will make for far more interesting conversation this night. Come, witcher. Take a seat by my side while I change. The reason is the same for the peacock's feathers and it holds true in modern society. When someone tells the truth that hurts their own reputation, we assume that they must be strong enough not to need people to like them. We see them as having supreme confidence. Geralt continues this habit, speaking plainly to royalty on multiple occasions. Fairness. Hey, I can't help you. So perilously direct. As queen, I could command it. If I were one of your subjects. I need your promise you won't come back. If I hear Ciri's in danger, you know I can't do that. Now, true to the handicap principle, although it signals deep confidence, telling the truth doesn't always put Geralt at an advantage. In fact, it gets him thrown into jail at one point. But when we see him do this as an audience, we understand how confident he must be in his own abilities to hold honesty above political advantage. And you can do the same thing in your own life just by being more honest. Even and especially in those places where you think it might set you back socially. For example, if you have a nerdy hobby that you think other people might judge, you're often better off speaking about it with enthusiasm rather than downplaying it. Take Henry Cavill here talking about his gaming and notice how it makes you feel about him. Are you guys surprised to find out that he was a gamer? No. No? No. Not at all. No, I wear my geek on my sleeve. Right, right. Yeah. In sum, being less socially calculated and instead, more honest in your self-expression, whether it's about a geeky hobby or an embarrassing story ultimately winds up making you come across as more confident and likable since you're not so worried about people's responses. Now, the last point is that Geralt is extremely non-reactive. He doesn't easily adopt other people's emotional tone. For instance, he stays calm as Yennefer chastises him here. Who let the djinn escape? Who knows what havoc it'll wreak now that it has no vessel at all? There's no more havoc than you. And djinns are only dark creatures when they're held captive. How can you be so sure? And he maintains his line of questioning when he's being screamed at by Ostrit. What are we doing here? What's happening? How can I lift the curse? Carry me out. I order you. Tell me how to lift the curse. You can contrast Geralt's relative calm with how Ostrit handles Geralt's questioning of him. Geralt speaks within seconds, betraying his own lack of confidence in what he's saying. What would I be doing in a daycare's bed? I smelled what you were doing. Fortest had no right! This all highlights one of the key indicators and creators of confidence— the ability to have a sturdy emotional center. The world will, of course, throw stresses, irritants, frustrations of all kinds at you. And when we see someone immediately succumb to a negative emotional state of another person, we see that they lack that grounded center. But when we notice that people are resilient and that their calmness is not easily pierced, we view them as more confident and capable. Their low reactivity signifies that whatever is coming at them is a problem that they can handle. Now, this principle plays out dramatically in the animal kingdom where a strong emotional mastery can trump physical strength in dominance battles. And I think, and I'm sure, if I would have even flinched once and would have dropped the camera or would have run or turned around, Adrian would have said, well, this is obviously not the right man to make this film. You see it again here as these calm tribesmen steal a kill off of a lion all through a solid non-reactive front in the face of danger. Now, of course, there will be things that create emotional shifts and part of being confident in the modern social world is the ability to express your emotions with honesty and vulnerability. This point is just to say that you want to cultivate a more firmly grounded internal calm so that you aren't always in constant reaction to the world. And we discussed tips for this in our video on Don Draper which you can watch via the link here in the corner. But what I want to add here in this video is the importance of recognizing your specific triggers. Some events and people are going to set you off pretty easily compared to other things so, literally, make a list. It might include family, a person that you might like to impress, or being involved in competition. In Geralt's case, he might recognize if he did this exercise that Yennefer sets him off quite easily. Every time I'm near you, I say more in five minutes than I've said in weeks and I always regret it. Writing your own triggers out can jog your memory in these moments where your cool is about to break and help you snap out of it in real time. Geralt, of course, doesn't do this and then he behaves in a way that he almost will definitely regret and it's safe to say that if he were always like this, he wouldn't have as many fans in this world or his own. What a day. I imagine you'll probably... Dammit, Jaskier! Why is it whenever I find myself in a pile of shit these days, it's you shoveling it? That's not fair. The child surprise, the gin, all of it. If you're someone who lacks confidence, these tips will definitely help you to appear more confident and make a stronger impression on the people that you meet. That said, ultimately, what you'll want to strive for is unshakable inner confidence. When you make deep confidence, your natural state of being, all these body language tips will happen more naturally. Now, having genuine confidence makes everything else we talk about on this channel easier whether your goal is to make more friends, get more dates, or build more meaningful connections at work. And if you want to build this inner unshakable confidence as quickly as possible, I recommend checking out our course, Charisma University. Charisma University is a step-by-step online program guaranteed to make you more confident and charismatic in just 30 days. Over 5,000 people have joined the program and here is what just a few of them have had to say about it. First, before CU, I sucked at having conversations and I had low confidence around people but I am way more confident now having gone through the daily action guides and I can see a big difference in the attention and respect that I get. It makes life so much more fun. I don't think it's an overstatement to say Charisma is literally a gateway to getting anything you want in life so thank you for making Charisma University. Another member wrote, after completing only just a few CU modules, my biggest breakthrough has been gaining more confidence. Just starting the course gave me the confidence that I can improve. If you knew me a year ago, you'd see a socially awkward guy but that same guy had hidden confidence and charisma that has now been unleashed. I can't wait to see how much more I can grow as I complete the other modules. If you're reading this or listening right now, think about who you want to be in a year. This course will teach you how to be that person. And this last one comes from a guy who says CU helped his dating life. He says, Hi, Charlie. Firstly, loving the course. I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation module. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we are dating. CU also comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason whatsoever and it's a 60-day guarantee even though the course is 30 days just so that you can go through making sure that there was absolutely no risk on your part at all.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"How do you become a man? Cultures around the world have long believed it doesn't just happen with age. Certain steps need to be taken and recently, the topic has gotten even more complicated with concerns of toxic masculinity on the rise. So in this video, I'll be using Cobra Kai to break down what I see as the four stages that men go through in the road to, quote-unquote, manhood. We'll talk about where guys go wrong and what you can do to get to the next phase of growth. And if you're curious, some of the lessons can be adapted to apply to women but since it's such a theme in Cobra Kai, I'll be speaking mostly about masculinity. Spoilers through season 2 of Cobra Kai to follow. So the first stage for all of us is boyhood. This is the stage we find Miguel, Eli, and Dimitri in at the beginning of season 1. They are uncomfortable, awkward kids who don't fit in, in large part, because they don't have strong role models to teach them. They think that none of that is ever going to change. Middle school life is their destiny. Dimitri is the mouthpiece for this worldview. You pretty much signed away all hopes of losing your virginity before college. It's probably for the best. It was starting to boost your confidence. Isn't that a good thing? No. What has confidence ever gotten anybody except for a black guy in their backpack throwing the trash? What is the best superpower anyone could have? Super strength. Wrong. Invisibility. A distant second would be super speed. To run away fast. In this phase, being bullied is very common, but so is being directionless which is what we see exemplified in Robby Keene. But what every one of these boys shares in common is that they lack strong male role models. They feel stuck without a game plan to overcome bullies, make good friends, and other challenges of growing up. Adolescence for them is painful. In some cases, their caring mothers try to step in to protect them but it only makes things worse because it reinforces that they cannot take care of themselves. I'm not gonna name names but the other day, a mother called me up because her son was crying after some kids online made fun of his facial deformity. And as far as these boys know, they're stuck. That's just life until they enter stage two. The mentor arrives and the boy becomes an eager student. You're gonna be my karate teacher? No. I'm gonna be your sensei. The mentor can be a book or a person or a way of living but whatever the form, it's the knowledge and guidance of a man who has come before you — a man who has figured out the solution to the problems that plague your life. Though the advice that this man gives is often challenging and stretches your comfort zone, when the boy follows it, things start to get awesome. In Miguel's case, he stands up for his friends in the face of a bully, defends the girl, and becomes one of the most respected kids in school not to mention that he winds up dating that girl who, of course, he has a crush on. You know this may be the best date I've ever been on. Eli follows a similar path, going from the kid that everyone picks on to Hawk, the quintessential confident bad boy that never gets picked on and girls swoon over. Hey, where you going? Oh, look at this freak. Oh, shit. What kind of girl would ever kiss this shit? This new life path works so well that young men often become evangelical in their adherence to these new rules of masculinity. They try to convert as many of their friends as possible, often believing that their role model, book, or life path is flawless. He's not a loser. If you knew him, you'd see he's a great man. Because this role model seems perfect, every piece of advice about being a man is taken to be law. Some of the advice is useful like being aggressive when it comes to achieving your goals. Hey, I like your hair. Thanks. I like yours too. It's spiky. But other bits of this law of being a man can be ridiculous. For instance, when I was going through middle school, wearing tidy whitey underwear meant that you weren't man enough — it had to be boxers. Wearing Axe brand body spray meant that you were definitely cool but then in high school, that rule got flipped and it meant you definitely were not. And none of this was being passed down by successful men who had come before us but instead, by slick advertising campaigns that knew we would do anything to be manly because we were lost. And in every case of prescribed manliness, we followed and enforced these rules on each other without even thinking if they made sense. But the biggest problem is not these ridiculous rules. It's that some of the rules that you were told about being a man actively hurt you and those around you. And this brings us to the third phase — when you start to recognize that blindly following every rule that your mentor or book gives is damaging to your life. When that happens, you become a wanderer. In this phase, you realize that your mentor isn't perfect whether he's deeply wounded like Kreese and Johnny or just run-of-the-mill imperfect like Daniel LaRusso. You realize you can't blindly accept everything that's been told to you. What worked for one generation in one context doesn't necessarily work for you today. You slowly begin to realize that you can't live by a set of rules that's been handed down from on high and it's a very scary period. The first season shows that Johnny is entering this phase. It starts small when he changes from insisting that using computers will make you a nerd and shouldn't be bothered with. Have you seriously never owned a computer before? Yeah, I'm not a nerd. But Johnny shifts his opinion when a viral video saves his financial life and Facebook lets him check up on old flames. The true culmination, though, of his realization comes when he sees his own son fall victim to the no mercy, win-at-any-cost mentality instilled in him when he was the eager student. He finally sees that some of the rules of manhood are destroying the things he cares about most. Sweep the leg. You have a problem with that? No, Sensei. I know we want to win but it's got to be the right way. We have to fight dirty. Dirty? There's nothing dirty about winning, Sensei. You taught me that. Miguel enters this phase in season two when he discovers that Hawk has vandalized Miyagi-Do and stole Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor, all under the sanctioned Cobra Kai rules of conduct. I even took Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor. In your own life, this phase comes when some problems don't go away or get worse even when you do things the way a man is supposed to. And as uncomfortable as it can feel to have your rules and way of life upended, it's essential to your growth. Otherwise, you'll wind up like Kreese, living by a code that made sense for a time but now just holds you back. So to help you out, here are a few of the lesser questioned beliefs about masculinity that I see messing up lives today. First, believing the only acceptable negative emotion is anger. So you get furiously angry or covertly depressed rather than experiencing pain in the form of crying or asking for help. Second, believing your value depends upon pleasing a partner. So men sometimes keep jobs they hate, sacrifice friendships, or shape their personalities all to be acceptable to their romantic partners. Third, believing that certain interests make you unmanly whether that's liking Dungeons and Dragons, poetry, dancing, or something else that's not considered manly enough. Fourth, believing fixed traits which you didn't choose can make you unmanly like being shorter than average or being gay. And fifth, putting your pride, ego, or manly reputation as highest priority which makes you snap and sabotage your goals like Hawk does in the tournament. I could rattle off more examples but the common thread is that it's at least worth questioning any of the unspoken rules you hold about what you need to do to be a man. Some you'll keep but some are middle school holdovers that have serious downsides to your success and happiness and this brings us to stage four — the free thinker where you're wandering stops being so circular and you form your own path. You've lived enough to know that there were valuable lessons in that second stage of being a student but they need to be adapted to your life's circumstances. You've learned that people will tell you to be a real man in order to control you and get you to do what they want and that is echoed in the advertisements that want to convince you that you can buy manhood with their product. Unlike Johnny, you've learned to ignore that. Sir, it's time to settle your tab and move on. Light beer is for pussies. Do I need to call the cops? In stage four, instead of trying to become a man or prove your masculinity, you're secure in the fact that what you are isn't defined by what other people say or think. You realize that labels like nerdy, girly, or lame were mostly mechanisms of control that just got you to shut up and do certain things and labels like badass, manly, or cool made you do other ones. It was a mechanism of control that got you to ignore your own interests. So you let go of caring so much about the labels and start caring about what you actually like. And by letting go of being perceived as more masculine, you naturally adopt the confidence and self-assuredness that has marked masculinity throughout history. Instead of looking to the world for signifiers of manhood, you simply are — you do your thing and you know that's enough. So whether you're a guy or not, I hope that when you watch this channel, you keep all of this in mind. While the advice we offer has worked for me and many others, the ultimate test is how it impacts your life. Test the guidance we give sincerely but don't let the rules we share trump your own experience. Even if you're in that eager student stage where you're following our advice and things are awesome, keep in mind that eventually, you will do things your own way and that will be even better.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': 'Narcissists don\\'t behave like most people — they take advantage of the social rules that we expect people to follow and their manipulations are shockingly effective if you\\'re unprepared. That\\'s why, in this video, we\\'re going to cover five tells that you\\'re dealing with a narcissist — one who is likely lying in an attempt to gaslight you. That way, you\\'re going to be more able to catch them and defend yourself. We\\'ll be using Jussie Smollett as an example. For those of you who missed out, in 2019, he claimed to have been the victim of a hate crime but his story quickly fell apart in ways that are instructive for catching narcissistic liars in your life. The first sign to keep an eye out for is the inclusion of details that only serve to establish a desirable persona. For instance, at Jussie Smollett\\'s sentencing, he shared this. I am not suicidal and if anything happens to me when I go in there, I did not do it to myself and you must all know that. Now, obviously, Jussie is not someone who\\'s going to be targeted for assassination inside prison so this outburst makes no sense as a protective measure but as an attempt to establish his own importance, it makes perfect sense. In a similar vein, during his Good Morning America interview, he emphasized this. I want them to see that I fought back and I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought back and it does not take anything away from people that are not able to do that but I fought back. They ran off. I didn\\'t. To catch these tales in real time in your life, ask yourself, why is this person sharing this story or this detail? If there\\'s no other purpose other than giving them a reputation they\\'d like to have, that is a red flag. Concretely, this often comes in the form of unsolicited name-dropping or stories of success that have little to do with the topic of conversation. But to be fair, we all tell self-aggrandizing stories from time to time and sometimes, those can be necessary to include for the sake of a story so this first point alone isn\\'t enough to determine if someone\\'s a narcissist which takes us to our second point in a much more telling giveaway. The way a narcissist describes other people is as if all their motivations relate back to the narcissist. For instance, ask yourself what kind of real human being would be prepared to do the things that Jussie describes. Who says, \"[Bleep], Empire, \"[Bleep], this MAGA country, \"[Bleep\"] ties a noose around your neck and pours bleach on you. Real people can definitely be motivated to commit heinous acts due to racism but very few MAGA-loving racists are probably watching Empire and even fewer of those people would walk around with bleach and a rope at 2 a.m. looking to assault Jussie without taking his wallet or getting some kind of benefit for themselves. In a narcissist\\'s mind, though, it makes sense that other people would be totally obsessed with them. That\\'s just the narcissist protecting his own worldview outward. He is so obsessed with himself that he can\\'t imagine anyone else not feeling that way and it shows up in stories of other people whose motivations revolve entirely around him. A great example of this is Jussie\\'s guess at what would motivate these supposed attackers. I come really, really hard against 45. I come really, really hard against his administration. Again, the idea that Jussie\\'s criticism of Trump was so remarkable that Trump diehards tracked him down at 2 a.m. is absurd. It requires caricatures of human beings who ignore the much more famous people criticizing Trump and also ignore their own desire to not freeze in sub-zero temperatures. So in your life, if someone tells you stories where everyone else puts them at the center of their universe, you\\'ve got a good sign you\\'re being lied to by a narcissist. Now with these tells in mind, you might start to raise suspicions at which point you should keep an eye out for the third tell and that is someone making skepticism evidence of a character flaw in the disbeliever. When most people tell true but tough-to-believe stories, they\\'re capable of seeing that what they know happened is difficult for other people to instantly believe. So they say things like, look, I know it sounds crazy but I swear it\\'s true. Those who tend more towards narcissism, though, struggle to view things from other people\\'s perspectives. Doubt is met with aggression as if skepticism wasn\\'t a reasonable response to an unreasonable story. For instance, here\\'s Jussie when he\\'s asked how he feels that people didn\\'t instantly believe his story — that strangers carrying rope and bleach recognized and assaulted him at 2 a.m. on a freezing cold night. It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim or Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. Jussie makes reasonable skepticism evidence of their moral failing. So if you find yourself constantly defending your character when asking clarifying questions, that\\'s a strong sign you\\'re being gaslit by a narcissist and it\\'s helpful in these situations to recognize that belief or non-belief is not a choice you make. It\\'s simply a result of how the facts line up in your mind. You actually have zero control over what you believe. Like when you stop believing in Santa Claus, that wasn\\'t a choice — it just stopped making sense and you couldn\\'t choose for it to make sense again. So the only control you have when you\\'re suspicious of someone is whether or not you ask for more details to try to understand their claims. Anyone who calls you out for doing this is criticizing you for being as supportive as you\\'re capable of being. Don\\'t allow anyone to make you feel guilty for this. On to the fourth sign — when most people are caught in a lie, they break down and admit it. But with narcissists, there\\'s not always an, oh, you got me moment. In the face of overwhelming evidence, they tend to dig in deeper. I did this and it means that I stuck my fist in the fears of black Americans in this country for over 400 years and the fears of the LGBTQ community. Your honor, I respect you and I respect the jury but I did not do this. Most people can\\'t imagine denying the truth when caught red-handed and it makes them second-guess themselves when they see another person do that. What if they\\'re telling the truth? After all, it\\'d be crazy to deny in the face of overwhelming evidence. But it makes much more sense when you realize that the more narcissistic someone is, the more important cultivating and preserving their images. So that image will be defended until the bitter end. This is the highlight that, unfortunately, you might never get the closure of the narcissist fessing up and you\\'ll probably be stuck with lingering uncertainty — were they really lying? Why would they even risk that? Which takes us to our fifth point — a cost-benefit analysis of a narcissist\\'s lies will probably make zero sense to you. Like, why would Jussie risk his budding career to fake a hate crime? Why would he pay to get punched in the face? We always ask these motive-seeking questions when determining if we\\'re being told a lie. With narcissists, we often detect no motive that we can relate to and this leads to a saying, well, nothing here adds up but they\\'ve got no reason to lie so I guess I believe them. Unfortunately, this isn\\'t necessarily a sign that they\\'re being truthful but a sign that their lies are narcissistic in nature. A lie that helps a narcissist move closer to a desired image is worth a big risk. Image is paramount and what makes them dangerous is the extreme lengths that they\\'re willing to go to build or maintain that image. So a highly suspicious claim that has no clear motive is a strong red flag for narcissistic manipulation. And here\\'s a bonus sixth tell that relates to all of us — narcissists tend to be perpetually unhappy due to that image-focused nature. Sure, they might put on a veneer of happiness since that\\'s what their persona demands but because their worldview revolves around other people\\'s perception of them and not the things they actually like, narcissists struggle to feel joy. And though they can appear highly confident, it really is just a cover for a deep lack of self-esteem that demands other people\\'s admiration to prop it up. So don\\'t envy the fake confidence of a narcissist and try to restrain those image-focused behaviors in your own life. They will not lead you to happiness, confidence, or real connection. So hopefully, you found some of these tips helpful for identifying and removing narcissists in your life and if you\\'re interested in actually building deep self-confidence that isn\\'t reliant on what other people think, you might like our flagship course, Charisma University. It\\'s a step-by-step program for building your confidence and charisma as quickly as possible. Over 9,000 people have joined the program so far and here\\'s what just a few of them have to say. Loving the course. I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation module. This one lesson completely changed my life. I\\'ve liked a girl for over a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was just too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we are dating. Another member wrote, I\\'ve already watched a lot of the YouTube channel and loved it but Charisma University\\'s action guide really helped me put this stuff into practice and changed my life. Insane social experiences I never thought I\\'d have and work-wise, I ended up getting a best-selling author as a mentor. I am so glad I joined. And this last one comes in saying, I am significantly more confident in all social situations. The connection I feel with strangers and close friends and family alike have increased dramatically. I transitioned from someone who never got asked to hang out regularly to multiple people texting me on a daily basis. Many people have openly expressed their admiration for me and I get a lot more positive attention. I have grown so much because of this course. I can\\'t thank you enough. Now, the program comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is for any reason whatsoever. It\\'s a 60-day guarantee even though the course is just 30 so there\\'s absolutely no risk on your side.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"This is hard. So, I was on the internet today, specifically YouTube, and I noticed something interesting. As I scrolled through the feed, I saw that there were several videos with Bill Gates in them, with a lot of views, but with a terrible upvote ratio, like in the red. And as I click on those videos, I see that they either have comments turned off, or the comments are absolutely awful. So, for instance, here I am on his Instagram right now. Are you reading this comments while having those baby's blood as dinner? Satan showed what he did, and he said today there's no superiority. So, a lot of Satan, the world says no, down with the system, the false prophet, despise the free lunch, no to Bill Gates, we do not consent. And if you do it on YouTube, there's a lot saying that he's the antichrist, devil, Satan incarnate. If you're interested in the specifics of why people are saying this, that's on you. That's not what I wanna analyze in this video. So, what interests me the most is, what is it that Bill is doing that make him so hard to trust for a lot of people? I really am just interested in what we can learn from a charisma perspective about why these rumors stick to him. I think that what is most upsetting to people actually is the way that Bill Gates portrays himself. It has to do with his body language, the way that he speaks, and we're gonna dive into that. But let's just start right here. So, here's Bill Gates on Ellen. So happy to have you here. This is the first time having you on, so thanks. So, I know you were. I'm gonna play that back. Here he is, Bill Gates, first time he meets Ellen. She says, great to have you here, first time I've seen you, and he does this. So happy to have you here. This is the first time having you on, so thanks. So, I know you were nervous. So, right off the bat, he seems to be uncomfortable, which I think, if you look up people like Mark Zuckerberg and you think back to his Senate hearing, I'm seeing some commonalities here. Thank you for doing this, and how is the family? How are you? Well, I think everybody's lives have been completely upended by this social isolation that we're doing to get the disease numbers way, way down. So, a completely different routine. He smiles as he's talking about very, very depressing statistics, and people, I think, take this as a disconcerting thing, whether or not they logically registered or not, that makes them not trust him. It's been termed duper's delight. The duper's delight is when somebody smiles in this particular, in this situation where they shouldn't smile because they're getting away with a lie, and unfortunately, I think that can often be confused with any sort of smile because someone is uncomfortable. It's also completely possible that when Bill Gates is smiling at these awkward times, that what he is is just socially uncomfortable, or perhaps earlier in his life, he didn't emote at all and was told, hey man, you need to smile more, so now every time that he's uncomfortable, he starts smiling more, and this is something that I'm seeing. He's just, he doesn't seem to have picked up on a lot of the unspoken social cues that a lot of people get. My question is, you warned everybody about this in a TED Talk in 2015. You predicted this would happen. And again, so what we're seeing, we got this shrug going on right here. So you predicted this would happen. You would expect someone in this kind of circumstance to recognize that this is a really sad thing, even if they didn't feel sad themselves, show that in their mannerisms, their body language, and you don't often see that from Bill Gates. Well, the goal of the 2015 talk and the detailed article, over the last five years, the foundation and others. He says um a lot. Now, I'll say um, you'll see me on this video. Everybody says um, but when somebody is as smart as Bill Gates is and we see them hesitant in their speech, it communicates that they might be trying to hide something. And that doesn't necessarily mean, of course, that that is true. You're gonna see something else here, which is where he swallows. So take a look at this. Even a vaccine, all of those things dramatically faster than what we're going through. So everybody swallows. They have to, that came across the wrong way. At some point, if you're speaking and you start to get a lot of saliva in your mouth, of course, you have to swallow. When you see someone do that, it is showing you that whatever's going on, they're probably not totally comfortable with because their speaking cadence and their breathing is such that they can't time the swallow in a way that isn't in the middle of a sentence. I did make investments in things like a coalition called CEPI that will. Here he is again, just a few seconds later. This is part of what I'm talking about. Swallowing once during conversation. Okay, maybe you had too much saliva in your mouth. Twice within about 15 seconds. That is a fairly strong indicator of discomfort. But it also can mean lying. You don't know what you're gonna say. You're choking back the truth. All of those things can be associated with, correctly, by the way, with swallowing. But this is part of the problem, I think, with reading body language and with the way that people make assumptions about other people. It's that one, you cannot one-to-one take any sort of body language cue and associate it with lying or not lying. It's very, very tough to read into this. And the reason is because there's many different reasons why people might do one thing or another. Discomfort, nervousness can very, very easily be conflated with deceptiveness. And we see the same sort of thing in Mark Zuckerberg. If you look back at his Senate speech, the way that he sipped the water was just strange and uncomfortable. You see the same thing with Bill Gates. Both he and Mark Zuckerberg appear uncomfortable in their own skin. So you take that, you take the fact that he's got these strange body language things going on, the fact that he's very introverted, you add to this that we're in a climate where billionaires are being reviled right now. Rightly or wrongly, they are not public friend number one. That's not to say that being a billionaire is immediately gonna be the thing that makes people hate Bill. I think if you take a look at somebody like Mark Cuban. So here's a handful of Cuban. What, he wore the mask. Representing, baby. He's a businessman all the time. So right off the bat here, you see him just being much more comfortable on his own skin. He's loud, he's gregarious, he's got an amazing tan line going on here. But he makes Kevin Hart laugh, straight off the bat. Poorly, basketball. Amen. I think I could probably go over. And you see right there, what you don't get from Bill are those encouraging smiles as you say the types of things. How good to have you, he loves basketball. And Mark Cuban is, amen, he's all into it. He's just immediately got that vibe of a big smile. He's comfortable on his own skin. It makes him much more trustworthy and likable. I love that you didn't bring the black guy from the show here. I got questions for him. Dave is a good dude, man. He is a good dude, but he don't buy enough. He buys nothing. He buys nothing at all. Nothing. I wanna know what's in his account. I don't think he should be on the show anymore. No, you gotta have Damon. Damon's my guy. I'm watching Mark Cuban, I'm realizing one of the other things that just to summarize that Bill Gates is missing is the positive effusive emotion. So you see Mark Cuban here really compliment Damon from Shark Tank. You see him laughing unrestrained. You see him with just a big smile as he is talking to Kevin. He seems to be really enjoying himself. And Bill Gates always seems much more reserved. If you don't see those positive emotions from people, again, I'm not saying that this is appropriate. I am saying that this tends to be the initial thin slice that people might have of you is one, just not gonna be one where they're super attracted to you even in a platonic way, but second, that it does come across as a little bit less trustworthy if you can't enjoy your time and laugh with someone. He really reminds me, and some of the reception that he is getting reminds me a lot of Mark Zuckerberg. I wanna look just in terms of these disconcerting, small facial tics that he tends to have. You can see Zuckerberg has ones that just, they're not evil, they just don't line up with what you might expect or hope. Senator, yes, there will always be a version of Facebook that is free. It is our mission to try to help connect to everyone around the world and to bring the world closer. So Bill isn't as bad as Mark here, but Mark has almost no movement in his dynamics, meaning the volume of what he is saying or in the pitch of what he is saying. And so when you do that and you are talking about what your mission is, when people are passionate about something, they tend to get louder or they may vary their dynamics or they might speak with a tone that has a little bit more to it. It goes up and it goes down. So here's what we get instead from Mark when he's talking about his mission. Version of Facebook that is free. It is our mission to try to help connect to everyone around the world and to bring the world closer together. In order to do that, we believe that we need to offer a service that everyone. So when you see that from someone, what you know is that they have likely practiced what they are saying, which is the case. And what gets read into that additionally is that they do not mean what they are saying. So interestingly, he is much more likable when talking about things that he's passionate about. So there's this one, it's a fiction book called Infinite Jest, but I'm trying to decide if I start it or not because I watched the movie, The End of the Tour. I loved it. David Foster Wallace comes across as a super interesting broad. So this is the most enthusiastic that I have seen, Bill. And it's very interesting. Thinking in person. If the book was like a two or 300 page book, there's no doubt. He's got, he's modulating a little bit more and he does sometimes, but he's moving forward. As I watch that movie, I dive in, but it's quite long and complicated. I don't wanna make an exception. It's my rule to get to the end. This really does touch on something that can help and it's to find a way to segue the conversations that you're into without hijacking them, to perhaps have a handful of phrases that open up the door for you to really talk about the things that you're passionate about. Because when I see him talk about the things that he's passionate about, he is much more likable. So what is it about Bill that makes him so much more of a target than Richard Branson? It's not the money, because they both got money. I do think it comes down to charisma. And I want this to highlight how important some of this stuff can be in your own life for two things. One, you do wanna start to learn some of the things. So if you wanna click some of our body language videos where we go into deeper what might help if this is something you struggle with, go ahead, I'll link to a playlist or some videos in the description and in the corner over here. Also, I wanna encourage people out there. If you've done your research and you've decided that you hate him, fine. But if you've watched a YouTube video or if you see that the social consensus is on the side of not liking him in whatever circle you're in, I would ask you to hold off on making a judgment. And not just for the sake of Bill Gates, but for the sake of everybody who might struggle to portray themselves in a way that is instantly charismatic and likable. So I think one of the worst things that I see in this is dehumanization. And when I look at the things that are being said about Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, while some of them find memeing and jest, it really is that they're lizards, that they're robots, that they are Satan incarnate, they are not human. And I think what is really occurring at a deep level is that there's a lot of frustration, resentment, and anger for the way that things have been going in people's lives. And that is occurring at the macro scale. We're all stuck inside right now. People are losing their jobs. But also it could be on the micro scale within one's own family. There's some anger that they haven't worked out with their friends or their parents or their brothers or their sisters. And I think that inner anger looks for an escape route. And this has happened all throughout human history and some group or some person becomes the subject of it because they are different. And the reason that they make such good targets, if you think throughout history, is because they are other, they are different. And we can say that the world's problems are coming from this class of people. If you think that it's the billionaires, if you think that it's the immigrants or the poor or the Republicans or the Democrats, I would really, really urge you to pause, take a deep breath, look inside, find where maybe some of that frustration is coming from and assume that while some people are doing kinder, nicer things than others, there isn't a class of person out there that isn't a human. And so just be careful what you say. Be careful what conclusions you jump to. And I don't think it helps. So anyway, I'm gonna get off my soapbox now. That's it for this video. I hope that you guys liked it. It's been a bit of a different style for me. I'm not totally, I feel a little bit like Bill Gates myself. This is my bedroom, actually. And I haven't quite got a lay of the land. I don't know what to do. But I do have this thing right here. Take a look. So if you guys have a preference of lighting, ooh, that's kind of nice. Why didn't I do that one? Let me know which ones you guys. So that's green. That's blue. We had like an orange or a red going on earlier. I think I kind of like the green. That looks pretty nice. Maybe the shadow's harsh. But let me know what you guys think of the setup. I'm getting more and more comfortable on camera in my bedroom. It is a strange thing to shoot like this. But I do hope to do more videos like this that I can get out faster when something topical happens. And it allows me just to give you guys my thoughts that are a little bit faster off the top of the dome. So hope that you guys enjoyed this video. If you liked it, please subscribe.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"A sad irony of the Joker is that it's only after his descent into madness that Arthur appears happy and confident. ♪♪ But of course, turning on the world isn't the only way to feel mentally strong and that's why in this video, I want to use Arthur's story to talk about five habits that kill your mental fortitude and your confidence and what you can do instead to build mental toughness. And I fully recognize that Arthur is someone with atypical neurology whose mental illness has a slew of causes outside of his control but these habits aren't helping him and I think they make an excellent jumping-off point to reveal tweaks that any of us can make to feel better in our own lives. Joker spoilers will, of course, follow. First off, we see that Arthur often engages in fantasy, imagining first that Murray would love him as a son. You see all this — the lights, the show, the audience, all that stuff — I'd give it all up in a heartbeat to have a kid like you. And then later, he fantasizes that he could just stroll into his neighbor's apartment after committing a triple homicide and make out with her out of nowhere. We've talked about the power of visualization in past videos, particularly on Conor McGregor. Vividly envisioning a desired outcome can make you more likely to achieve it but it's important to note that Arthur's fantasies do not have the same positive impact as the visualizations that we discussed. And the fundamental difference is that visualizations include the work necessary to achieve a goal whereas fantasies focus just on the crowning moment of glory. Arthur doesn't imagine practicing his stand-up routine with improved timing. He doesn't imagine properly introducing himself to his neighbor or asking her on a date. He skips right to the unearned payoff. Now, you definitely want to avoid this trap in your own life otherwise, you're conditioning yourself to be a dreamer that never quite makes it. So make sure that your visualizations include not just the moment of success but also some of the realistic effort that is going to be required to get there. That will inspire you to take the appropriate actions rather than simply waiting for miracles to occur. Which takes us to the second point — Arthur and his environment undermine his own self-efficacy. He doesn't feel as if he can take steps to change his life and we see an example of when he's falsely accused of stealing a sign from work he barely protests. ...never even returned his sign. Because I got jumped. Didn't you hear? If you don't return the sign, I got to take it out of your paycheck. Are we clear? This unwillingness to self-advocate may come from Arthur's upbringing. His mother reinforces the idea that Arthur is incapable of changing things by constantly insisting that the only path to a better life is for Thomas Wayne to come out of the blue and rescue them. Why would he help us? Because Thomas Wayne is a good man. If he knew how we were living, if he saw this place, it would make him sick. Arthur's lack of self-confidence and self-efficacy is further compounded by her insistence on a fixed mentality when it comes to skill acquisition. For instance, when Arthur talks about doing stand-up, she doesn't encourage him to practice but instead treats his talent as something that is completely limited and fixed. Everybody's telling me that my stand-up's ready for the big clubs. But, Happy, what makes you think you could do that? Me? Me. Don't you have to be funny to be a comedian? Now, she has a point. Arthur's jokes probably won't go over very well but rather than talking about being funny, a better frame would be to talk about the need to practice writing jokes. One implies a helpless world view — you either are or you aren't and dreams can never be achieved if you aren't. And the other implies that dedicated hard work can make an impact but instead, Arthur feels helpless with the exception of the one thing that ever gave him power — violence. Now, your circumstances may not be as dire as Arthur's but the lesson remains — if you want to feel confident, don't undercut your own self-efficacy. Take steps, even small ones, to affirm that you can improve your life be it by exercising, striking up conversation with people that you encounter during your day, or standing up for yourself when you feel that you're being treated unfairly. We have videos that can help you specifically with starting those conversations and on the best ways to handle conversational aggression but the mindset that you can achieve and are worthy of an excellent life no matter where you start from is absolutely true and that's what I want to emphasize to you here. Now, the third thing that I want to talk about is a problem that many of us face which is that Arthur has no outlet where he can honestly express his emotions particularly the most challenging ones. All I have are negative thoughts. The one supposed person who is to be an outlet, Arthur's social worker, doesn't even listen to him or, at least, Arthur doesn't feel that she does. You don't listen, do you? I don't think you ever really hear me. Bottling up your emotions is the common prescription in modern society — suck it up, tough it out, keep your chin up, we say — and this all has its place like when you need to power through a difficult day without breaking down but there needs to be a release valve for the tension that gets built up because if you don't, what Carl Jung called the shadow can overtake you. That is to say that all of your repressed feelings will find a way out often in a destructive fashion. Arthur can't express and integrate his difficult emotions and eventually, he becomes his shadow, the Joker. The solution for Arthur and for the rest of us is to find some sort of healthy outlet for challenging emotions. Arthur was on to something here as creative outlets like journaling and stand-up can be great ways to transform inner turmoil. Other people prefer vigorous exercise or hitting a punching bag to give their aggression an outlet. However you do it, integrating your shadow side will make you feel much more mentally sound and likely more confident since you're no longer denying aspects of yourself which highlights the next main point — Arthur inadvertently disowns aspects of himself sometimes by labeling his emotions away. Give me your... No! No! I'm not talking to you until you stop being angry! Okay. I'm not angry. Please. And other times with all-encompassing language that doesn't acknowledge the true complexity of his emotional life. I've never heard him cry. He's always been such a happy little boy. I haven't been happy one minute of my entire f***ing life. Now in conversation, there's nothing wrong with saying that you're not mad to calm yourself down or calling yourself a happy person but it's important to realize that our emotional lives are complex and they do not fit neatly into the language that we often use to describe ourselves. When we feel forced to make our emotions conform to the way in which we describe ourselves, for instance, by living up to our happy reputation, we engage in self-denial and if that's done over a long period of time, it can cause the eruption of the repressed shadow. A particular thing to keep in mind if you're an introverted fan of this channel is that you don't always have to push yourself to be charismatic, social, and extroverted — honoring the part of yourself that just wants to be alone sometimes is totally healthy. And this brings us to our last point — everything that we have discussed results in Arthur's total hatred of the world. I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody is awful these days. It's enough to make anyone crazy. Not everybody and I'll tell you this — not everyone is awful. You're awful, Murray. People don't care about Arthur and so, in return, he doesn't care about them. If it was me dying on the sidewalk, you'd walk right over me. I pass you every day and you don't notice me but these guys, what, because Thomas Wayne cried about them on TV? Now this belief enrages Arthur to the point of murder and it's certainly true that we see people treat Arthur terribly without ever considering his feelings but it's also true that we don't see Arthur follow his own advice. He doesn't put himself in the other guy's shoes. For instance, he doesn't consider that maybe Thomas Wayne wouldn't take kindly to the man who stuck his fingers in his son's mouth and strangled his butler. He doesn't consider that Randall's lying about the gun was probably motivated to save his own job the same way that Arthur lied about the gun in an attempt to save his job. I love this job. It's a prop. Part of my act now. That's bullshit. Bullshit. Besides, Randall told me you tried to buy a .38 off him last week. Randall told you that? Were Arthur more able to think what it's like to be the other guy, he might find forgiveness or simply compassion for his deeply disturbed mother. He might think about a better way to contact Thomas Wayne so as not to put him on the defensive. Now, obviously, Arthur has trauma and serious untreated mental illness so this point isn't so much about what he should have done but about what we can learn from him. Perhaps you can think what it's like to be the other guy at some point today maybe even if it's someone that you feel has wronged you. This empathetic perspective makes you far more socially effective and it makes you less likely to become caught up in negative spirals which, addictive as they may feel, really only serve to make you feel frustrated or weak. One thing that really aggravates Arthur's problems is that he doesn't have a strong support network. He doesn't have friendships at work or outside of it and his relationship with his girlfriend exists only in his imagination. Now, I imagine that you are probably in a better situation with Arthur but based on the comments in past videos, it seems like many of you would enjoy having more strong friendships, better relationships at work, and a better dating life.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"I said it last year, we're not here just to take part, we're here to take over. It's Conor McGregor! Whether you love him or hate him, it's undeniable that Conor McGregor's charisma made him incredibly popular, with five of the top six pay-per-views in MMA history. So in this video, we'll break down some common patterns from his most savage moments, why they made him so popular, and even how you can adapt some of the psychology into your own life. The first common theme you'll see in many of Conor's most popular moments is he projects a self-confidence that many fans admire. Some might see Conor's popularity as evidence that people are drawn to jerks, but that isn't the case. What people are drawn to is that he has self-generated self-esteem. That's easy enough to say, but as an example, watch his reaction when he hears one of his opponents say they don't like him. Most people worry about being liked, sometimes even hiding parts of themselves hoping to make a better impression. In contrast, Conor is unapologetically himself. His speech after winning the lightweight belt is a great example of this. In your own life, being unapologetic 24-7 is a recipe for disaster, but many people will say I'm sorry for things that aren't their fault or that they don't think were wrong just to try to people-please or avoid conflict. It's an exaggerated scene, but sadly, too many relationships look like stews from The Hangover. Taking ownership when you've screwed up is a great way to keep relationships and even earn respect, but apologizing just to avoid conflict is a surefire way to lose respect from people. Another reason some people love Conor's trash talk is because he'll say and do things they wouldn't have the courage to do themselves. The absence of fear when most people would be afraid tends to earn you respect. Conor projects fearlessness in three ways. The most obvious one is he talks about it. This is the easiest to do but also the least convincing to other people. Conor also does things most people would be afraid to do, like stealing the belt from a man that hadn't lost a fight in 10 years. The third way to convey fearlessness is with your body language. In the face of confrontation, Conor keeps his shoulders back, his head up, and his eyes locked on whoever is challenging him. This is a nice habit to build because in addition to making you look more confident, getting yourself to stand up straight with your shoulders back and your chin up will actually make you feel more confident in the moments that would normally make you nervous. Another thing that Conor does that projects confidence when trash talking is maintaining the spotlight until he decides to let it go. For example, watch him here with Chad Mendes. Chad tries to cut him off multiple times, but Conor keeps talking as if Chad isn't there. He's too small. He's too small. It's as simple as that. The power to go along with the precision will absolutely demolish him. You're cutting too much weight. He has a few scrambles in him and then he will break. Then I'm going to pick him apart. Cutting someone off is a subtle display of power. If it's allowed to happen, the person who got cut off is deferring to the person who interrupted them. Here's another example with Cowboy Cerrone where Conor's talking about moving up in his weight class. This does not mean you should go around shouting over other people, but it does mean you'll generate more respect and show more confidence if you don't let other people cut you off. The best way to handle this is to finish your sentence without trailing off whenever someone tries to cut you off. That way you can still have a free-flowing conversation and people can interrupt, but you aren't instantly yielding the floor anytime someone interrupts you. The last way Conor projects confidence in his trash talk is by giving specific predictions for his fights. That's what I see the fight player now. I feel him overreacting, overextending, and then being KO'd unconscious. I said I'd knock him out in the first round and I knocked him out in the first round. You can call me Mystic Mac because I predict these things. And Mystic Mac predicts I'm going to KO you inside one round. Most fighters, when asked to predict their fights, say something vague like, I think it'll be a great fight, or I think I'm going to knock him out. There's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't make a statement. Conor's predictions built a mystique around him and made people want to watch to see if he was right. This is something Muhammad Ali was famous for, and since Conor is a huge Ali fan, I think it's probable that Ali was his inspiration for making these types of predictions. Well, Henry Cooper's nothing but a tramp. He's a bum. I'm the world's greatest. He must fall in five rounds, but if you talk about me, I'll cut it three. We're not encouraging you to do this, but it's worth noting, making bold specific predictions is all upside. If you get it right, people think you're a genius, but if you get it wrong, people don't hold it against you. That's why political pundits, sports analysts, and stock pickers do this all the time. So don't trust someone just because they got a guess right about the future. They likely have a bunch of misses you haven't seen. Mystic Mac himself was way off on both of his Diaz predictions, but predictably, it didn't hurt his popularity at all. Now, it's worth mentioning that at the height of his fame, Conor's confidence actually started getting him into trouble because it morphed into a false sense that he could do no wrong. When you can rack up $400 million in revenue for the company and back-to-back events, you can do whatever the fuck you want. I'm living the whatever the fuck I want life. That's the life I live. Whatever I want. This eventually led to a downward spiral for Conor where he threw a dolly at a bus, sucker-punched an old man in the side of the head, and got into a bunch of civil lawsuits. The second common theme from Conor's most popular savage moments is he is an expert at using humor to his advantage. The obvious benefit of this is that fans like him because he makes them laugh. These custom-made suits aren't cheap, you know what I mean? This solid gold pocket watch, three people died making this watch, you know what I mean? But his humor has another benefit. By making other people laugh at you, he's hoping to get in your head and make you lose composure in the fight. One way he'll do this is by throwing a spotlight on your insecurities. His chin, his chin is deteriorating. Every single contest he gets in, he hits one knee. He does a gust of wind and he does the chicken dance, you know what I mean? Once he finds a weakness that seems to hit home, he'll often double down on it. I'm really coming along as a fighter and I feel like I'm hitting my stride right now and it couldn't be better. You get wobbled in every fight, Dustin. Every fight. You get dropped to one knee in every fight. Every single fight you get dropped to one knee. Another common tactic Conor will use to get his opponent angry is to trash talk where you're from. If this was a different time, I would invade his favela on horseback and kill anyone that was not fit to walk. But we are in a new time, so I'll whoop his ass in July. Don't get me wrong, I like the kid. He's a quiet little hillbilly from the back ass of nowhere. You know, I have nothing against the guy, you know what I mean? I'm sure he grew up in a circus or a fair. You know, he's a nice little kid. Both of these are standard bullying tactics and most people will look down on you if you're not a prizefighter. That said, Conor does this on purpose because he thinks it makes his opponents fight worse. Here he talks about the toll of this mental warfare on Jose Aldo. Every single movement I make will get an overreaction off of him because he's emotionally invested in it. There's too much in it for him. It's all piling on him. So I feel if I just go, he will react a million times. In fighting, winning is everything and while winning, Conor's worst behaviors were forgiven. But most of us aren't fighters and unlike Conor, we want people to like us. So in your own life, do the opposite of Conor and aim to take shots that will make people laugh along with you. The best way to do this is to tease something the person isn't sensitive about. For example, watch Floyd Mayweather's reaction when Conor compares the two of them. Floyd has made over a billion dollars so he isn't worried about how he was doing at 28 years old. Now all that said, Conor does have another way he uses humor that can work well for anyone almost any time. He uses humor to dictate the frame of a conversation. Here's a quick example after Conor is asked a question at a press conference. Obviously, he's trying to establish the frame that the best fighter is the one that hits hardest. And you can tell from his little smirk at the end he's thinking, I got Conor on that one. Watch how Conor responds. Conor uses humor to completely dismiss Jeremy without having to address his argument. The best part is, Conor later admitted this reframe wasn't even true. When you're being insulted, taking control of frame to dismiss the other person is great. But when talking with or about people from your friend group, your other option is to go with a positive reframe. Here's a great example where Eddie Alvarez tries to insult Conor's coach. By having positive reframes, you'll get the benefit of making people laugh and make the subject of the joke like you more. So more often than not, you're better off making jokes that have a positive punchline. This is true for jokes about other people and for jokes about yourself. One quick thing it's important to remember when talking about Conor's savage moments, a major factor of Conor's appeal was he backed up his trash talk with dominant victories and exciting fights. Some of his most savage moments happened to be in the Octagon. It's also important to recognize that Conor wasn't disrespectful all the time. He was always respectful after the fight, which gives the impression that a lot of the pre-fight stuff was just for show. Showing respect after the fight framed his trash talk as a fun act, rather than a real representation of Conor as a person. That changed a little bit with the Khabib fight when Conor's trash talk had a lot more anger in it. If he'd won, he might have revealed it was an act and been humble and respectful, but we'll never know. And as is, it soured some Conor fans because his funny, lighthearted jokes started to blur the line into arrogance. But in his next fight, he was back to showing respect. This template is a solid one to follow in your own social life. At the start, it's great to be fun and funny, focusing on poking fun and making people laugh. But if you don't switch over to being genuine at some point later in the interaction, you're less likely to form real connections with people. Beyond his trash talk and flashy wins, Conor's incredible success is also due to the fact that he advocates for himself and explicitly asks for what he wants. Here are a few quick examples from throughout his career. By contrast, look at what Thiago Santos said through a translator after losing a close split decision to Jon Jones that many people thought he won. That level of gratitude is fantastic to have. It makes him extremely likable and is probably great for his happiness. Unfortunately, because of it, Thiago lost out on a ton of money and another chance to fight for the belt. He didn't have to go full Conor and insult Jon, but it would have helped him a lot to call for a rematch after such a great performance. This has huge real-world parallels. Payscale surveys show only 37% of workers ask for raises, but 70% of employees who do ask for a raise are given one. And in dating, obviously you're much more likely to go out with someone if you have the confidence to ask them out. If the idea of advocating for yourself and asking for what you want makes you nervous, I recommend checking out our course Charisma University. In my opinion, it's the absolute fastest way to build deep confidence. We actually guarantee it'll make you more confident and charismatic in just 30 days or you can get your money back. Over 5,000 people have joined the program. Here's what just a few of them have had to say. Before CU, I sucked at having conversations and I had low confidence around people, but I am way more confident now having gone through the daily action guides and I can see a big difference in the intention and respect that I get. It makes life so much more fun. I don't think it's an overstatement to say Charisma is literally a gateway to getting anything you want in life, so thank you for making Charisma University. Another member wrote, After completing only just a few CU modules, my biggest breakthrough has been gaining more confidence. Just starting the course gave me the confidence that I can improve. If you knew me a year ago, you'd see a socially awkward guy, but that same guy had hidden confidence and charisma that has now been unleashed. I can't wait to see how much more I can grow as I complete the other modules. If you're reading this or listening right now, think about who you want to be in a year. This course will teach you how to be that person. And this last one comes from a guy who says CU helped his dating life. He says, Firstly, loving the course. I have cherry picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation model. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for over a year, but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we're dating. CU comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason whatsoever. And it's 60 days, even though the course is only 30 days, just to make sure there's absolutely no risk on your part at all. Either you become more confident and charismatic, or you get every single penny back.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': 'A few recent Brie Larson interviews have caught the attention of Marvel fans. Right, guys? Yeah. Isn\\'t it fun being there for all my extra takes? People have asked if the cast doesn\\'t get along with Brie and even as an audience member, it\\'s tough to sit through some of these interviews without cringing. So today, I want to talk about what you can learn from these situations and how to prevent yourself from doing specific behavior patterns that can make people dislike you without you intending or even realizing it. And I want to make this clear — there are interviews that I can show you where Brie is extremely likable. You\\'re gonna see a few clips of them in this video. I\\'m addressing these two more recent interviews because they\\'re topical and because they provide great insight into charisma mistakes that I see many people make. The first issue that you want to avoid is reading negative intent in an ambiguous situation. Brie\\'s Wired interview has this repeatedly. Go to college. No! Would Brie Larson work out? Like, hypothetically, would I at some point? Is that like a personal attack or something? Is that a request? Do you think I should? Yeah, I work out a lot. Thanks for asking. We\\'ll come back to this idea of interpreting negative intent because it is possible that she wasn\\'t doing that at all and was actually aiming for sarcasm in these situations. The problem is that sarcasm requires a tell. You must go over-the-top either in your word choice, body language, or tone or people will not recognize sarcasm where you might have intended it. Without that, Brie\\'s defensiveness appears sincere. Left-handed? Why do you need to know? Can Captain Marvel beat Superman? I can\\'t believe you have to Google that. Duh. I mean, why? To be clear, you can add sarcasm to this type of a joke. For instance, Aubrey Plaza gives similar responses in her Wired interview but people responded much better and it\\'s because she\\'s communicating that she doesn\\'t mean what she says. In this case, by narrowing her eyes and changing her tone slightly. Does Aubrey Plaza have a sister? I have two sisters. That\\'s none of your business. That\\'s my family. Since it is so subtle, this level of sarcasm will be missed by many people and I know that British people are going to hate this recommendation but at least in America, a good rule of thumb is that when you are being tongue-in-cheek, do not be flat in your delivery especially if a literal interpretation of what you\\'re saying would make you sound like a jerk. Go over-the-top in changing your tone, your gestures, or your facial expressions. This helps people distinguish between normal conversation and a character that you are playing for the purpose of a joke. This next clip is a great example of Brie playing like she\\'s upset while making it clear that that isn\\'t truly how she feels — she\\'s not really offended. Now watch for the change in her voice tone and her over-the-top gesticulating. That\\'s a problem? Well, I feel inferior but it\\'s okay. Go for it. Why would you feel inferior? Well, look at it. First of all, and second of all, I have nothing. Oh, no, no. Right there. Look, you got a little... Oh, great. There you go. But back to the first point — it is possible that Brie might be sincere in her frustration with these questions. Now, obviously, we can\\'t read minds but there is no absurdity, no smile to release the tension, just flat statements as if she is interpreting what she was being asked as an attack. Is that like a personal attack or something? Regardless of what was happening in Brie\\'s head, in your own life, you would benefit tremendously from reading positive intent into ambiguous situations like these. In fact, even when people are undeniably being rude to you, reading positive intent can be an excellent way to gain control of the situation. It\\'s part of what made Russell Brand so admirable in his MSNBC interview from several years ago. That entire interaction deserves a breakdown on its own but just watch here where the host takes aim at Russell\\'s accent. He could get flustered in response but instead, he assumes positive intent and cracks back a friendly joke. ...on satellite radio in the car. I can\\'t understand a single joke. You can\\'t understand it? Can you understand me? Yes, but I\\'m telling when I\\'m driving in the car and everyone\\'s laughing in the audience of the radio, I\\'m like, I have no idea what he\\'s saying. The best you focus on your driving, Brian. You\\'re a man, you don\\'t want to be distracted by humor, you might crash into a pedestrian. So it\\'s a good thing? I think it\\'s probably for the best. Jokes like these that interpret positive intent can go a long way to winning the person over who is being rude to you though it didn\\'t actually work in this particular situation. And if you\\'d like a breakdown of this entire interaction, just let us know in the comments. Just so you guys know, due to your overwhelming response, we are working now on a video that covers attachment theory. But moving along with this video to the third point, you should not jump on every opportunity to call praise or attention to yourself. Now in this next clip, Chris Hemsworth is talking up his stunt double and he\\'s putting himself down to do it. This is a nice common move for somebody who is kind of on top and in this case, Hemsworth is clearly athletic and powerful and famous so it\\'s kind of him to take that trainer and put him above him even if it means denigrating himself to do it. He just gets injured and I don\\'t. He does all the hard stuff and makes me look cool and then, but now I\\'ve told you, it doesn\\'t make me look cool, does it? If you\\'re in a situation like this sitting next to someone who has just done this, it\\'s a great opportunity to further spread the praise. In this case, you might want to spread it to other stunt doubles, to the visual effects team for making the impossible appear real or just your castmates in general. It is perhaps the worst opportunity to insist on your own specialness because it contrasts so starkly with Chris\\'s humility and it also puts him on the defensive since he was putting himself down and now we\\'re taking that seriously. Unfortunately, that is the route that Brie went. So you don\\'t do... I do all my stunts. I did my stunts because I thought that that\\'s what everyone did and then... Again, this is another situation where voice tone matters massively. If Brie had said something like, ,\"Wait a second. You guys got stunt doubles? I thought we were supposed to do all that crazy stuff by ourself,\" people probably would have just laughed at that but without anything over the top, without playing a character, she appears sincere in her attempt to call positive attention to herself and it doesn\\'t play well. A now defensive Chris pokes her back doubting that she does her own stunts and he mentions Tom Cruise as a contrast. I did my stunts because I thought that that\\'s what everyone did and then... Tom Cruise, I mean... And again, rather than taking this opportunity to praise Tom Cruise\\'s legendary status in the industry as one of the A-listers who truly does his own stunts and put himself on the line, Brie insists on distinguishing herself further. No, I\\'ll be the first me, not the next Tom Cruise. Thank you very much. Well, I mean, he does his own stunts, you know. No, we all do stunts. If you\\'re in a situation like this, the charismatic move, the confident move is to spread the praise. Don\\'t worry so much if you\\'re getting yours. When you give it freely, it comes back to you freely. Watch Chris Pratt illustrate this point perfectly. The Avengers cast are asked who the most charming Chris is. Look at how he handles it. Who\\'s the most charming Chris? Why don\\'t you love yourself, man? Come on. Because he\\'s humble. Sorry. I lost for a moment. No, I get it. It is exactly his own willingness to raise somebody else up that is what makes other people vote for him in droves. She\\'s so happy about it. He\\'s my soul brother. This all takes us to the fourth point of the video which is you should not try to win each moment of banter. This makes it harder to feel comfortable joking with you because things always become competitive. Take as an example when Brie says that she\\'s the strongest character in the movie which, though dry, could be considered a playful jab at her co-stars. Chris, predictably, jabs back and the high-pitched voice is an indication that he\\'s being playful as are the extreme head movements and eventually, he gets a laugh from the people around him. Is there any competition between the different sex, the different groups? There\\'s no competition for me because I\\'m the strongest so it\\'s just kind of like a different— Oh, yeah. You should let her think that. It\\'s not. As I\\'ve said before, it\\'s just a fact. It\\'s not a personal opinion. It\\'s not a reflection on what you can\\'t do but it is also kind of a reflection on all that you can do. It\\'s just that you\\'re just not that strong. Now with that laugh, Chris has quote-unquote won this round of banter but in order to let Bree say face, he adds that her character is really smart. ...really smart and, you know, right. Should we have a fight? Bree shakes her head no, fidgets with her earring and then when Chris says that we should have a fight, she doesn\\'t interpret it positively or playfully. She seems to feel as if she is being laughed at so rather than saying, Oh my god, we should totally have a fight in the next Avengers or making some other joke, she says that she feels like she\\'s been fighting with him all day and you get the sense that she\\'s being honest. Should we have a fight? I feel like we\\'re fighting now. I think it\\'s been an all-day thing. I suspect that is a real representation of her feelings. She probably does feel like these exchanges are fights and that can be exhausting. If you\\'ve ever felt like this, here is a way out. Sometimes, it is better to stop fighting. Don\\'t try to win every laugh from the audience. Instead, go with the joke even if it feels like you\\'re the butt of that joke and then amplify it. By not taking this kind of insulting joke seriously, you diffuse its power and you turn the crowd from laughing at you to laughing with you. Here is Brie doing it in another interview with Craig Ferguson when he teases her name. That\\'s a lovely name, Brie. Is that really — are you named after a cheese? Yes, I am. Really? I\\'m named after a cheese. I get confused all the time. I walk into rooms and people are like, Ah! I didn\\'t know it was going to be a human. I thought it was going to be a cheese. No. No! And here\\'s another example of Chris Pratt taking one on the chin in good spirit. Is Chris Pratt the worst Chris? It should just be this. Is Chris Pratt the worst? Kind of. I\\'m kind of the worst. This is all much easier if you interpret positive intent per the first point. So, now, the last thing that I want to touch on is how to handle a compliment. You should avoid responding to compliments with banter that are put-downs in nature even if you\\'re joking like this. Panic attack? Oh, Chris. That\\'s really nice. I\\'m still stronger than you, though. You\\'re not, though. Instead, you can give a sincere thank you emphasized, perhaps, with sustained eye contact or a touch. You\\'re toying with me. I like your bejeweled epaulets, by the way. That\\'s very nice. It\\'s like you\\'re a sort of commander of fabulous. Alternatively, you can spin it back around to the other person and playfully find a way to give them back an even bigger compliment. Well, I think you should take a lot of it. Thank you, Fifi Lox. And I have just spoken to Jonah and he said you should, too. Jonah said? Yes. There you go. They love you. I\\'ll give Jonah credit, then. It\\'s only honorable, isn\\'t it? Jonah can have credit. Okay. Either way, whatever you do, do not punish people when they give you compliments otherwise, they will not be so forthcoming. When in doubt, a sincere thank you and a smile or just a return to compliment will take you much farther. So I hope that you guys enjoyed this video.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Paul Rudd is almost universally well-liked and after watching his most recent Hot Ones interview, I realized he makes an excellent example of some of the most fundamental and easy-to-implement charisma principles that nonetheless, most people just skip. So in this video, we will be covering those five core principles and what you can do to make sure you're not one of the people who are getting it wrong. Our first point has to do with touch. As we've often discussed in previous breakdowns, physical contact is a direct way to communicate that you care about someone but too often nowadays, we pass up on the initial chances to make that sort of contact, skipping a handshake or a hug to opt instead for a fist bump or a wave. It may feel proper the first time that we meet someone but before long, we've known someone for months and still feel awkward about any sort of friendly touch. Paul Rudd though shows what happens when you don't let that pattern play out like here. I wish that someone would lean on my shoulder like that someday. And here with Jeremy Renner. Look at this. Yeah, with you too. Stop it. Okay, this is great. This is perfect. Now those are obviously big and more intimate moments of touching but the initial point stands — in order to get to this point, don't pass up on the chance to initiate friendly touching in those first interactions. So stand up out of your chair when someone walks into the room, give a handshake or even a hug and then as the relationship develops, that can develop into shoulder squeezes, back pats, or even full-on hugs and we have a ton more about touching in our video on Chris Hemsworth and Oprah which I will link to in the description. But these clips actually show another element of Paul's charm which is that when given the chance, he chooses to joke positively about other people. For example, let's go back to that clip of Paul leaning his head on Scarlett's shoulder and take a look at what happens next. It didn't feel as real as that. I know. You know why? It's because of that weird angle. I couldn't use your shoulder. I need a beefier shoulder. Now, after Scarlett teases herself, Paul has two options — he could either follow it up by teasing her in turn or he could go the opposite way by turning the joke around and, of course, he goes for the option that elevates Scarlett by shifting the fall towards himself. I gotta start lifting. No, you don't. I just need a beefier head. Yeah, you need a much beefier head. Here's another example. Notice how Paul chooses to validate the two hosts in response to Conan's self-deprecating joke instead of accepting the joke's premise as a joke. Instead of accepting the joke's premise as its stance. I want to congratulate you. You are in the Sexiest Man Alive issue. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. That's okay. We stepped aside this year so that you... And again, here's Paul responding to a joke about only being there to promote a movie by expressing his affection for the host. So you're being a team player. You want to promote this film. You want to get it out there in the proper way. I hear you, Paul. You know, it's about you, Rich. The point of all these clips is that while playful teasing can be charming on occasion amongst friends, opting for more supportive forms of humor makes people more drawn to your positivity and your friendliness. So the next time a clever joke is on the tip of your tongue, ask yourself, does this elevate someone or does it put them down even if it's just in a joking manner? If it's the latter, try instead to comically exaggerate that person's positive attributes which can get you the same amount of laughter while making them like you even more. Now, this takes us to the next point which also has to do with raising others up through humor but this time, it's about supporting other people's jokes. No matter how good or lousy a joke may be on its own, having two people play off one another creates a back-and-forth dynamic that can turn even a simple joke into a hilarious running gag. Even so, most people tend to focus on coming up with their own jokes missing many potential opportunities to build on the jokes of others. Paul, though, seems keen to jump on the end of jokes that don't go over so well to make something of those jokes like here with Sean Evans. Cauliflower wings. I'd like to point out yours is much neater than mine that's falling off the board. I like it. It looks like an abstract painting. Well, if you want to see an abstract painting, I'm gonna do a Jackson Pollock when we're done shooting this segment. Paul prevents the joke from falling flat and validates Sean for coming up with it. Now, of course, it's always easier to joke around with people that you know well so the best example of Paul supporting other people's jokes come from the press junket for Avengers with Jeremy Renner. The dynamic usually consists of Jeremy making a joke and then Paul building on it like here. So I'm very excited to see this movie. Me too. Can you see it on my face? This is my excited face. I can see it. I've hung out with him a lot. You can't even taint him right now. You can see that people really crack up once Paul takes that joke to the next level and sometimes, all it takes to do this is to mirror someone's position for a bit of physical comedy like here. It's been... Tell me. It's been... I gotta say... This is my Oprah question. Building on other people's jokes makes you a fun person to be around but that's not the main reason that it is such a charming habit. It's because having our jokes fall flat can be quite embarrassing even humiliating at times so when someone supports even the most dud of a joke that you might make, you will really appreciate that person which means that when you're out with people you spend time with like friends or colleagues, instead of focusing on one-upping their jokes in order to get attention for yourself, look for opportunities to build on their jokes and make them feel good. You can even save a joke that is failing in front of a group which will make them appreciate you a ton. But of course, the most straightforward way to validate people and make them feel good is to compliment them and that brings us to the next thing that we can learn from Paul about direct and genuine compliments. Now, obviously, compliments can, on occasion, make people feel self-conscious or embarrassed and in previous breakdowns, we've talked about breaking that tension that might be created by adding a joke afterwards like this... You look nice. I like that dress. Thank you. You laid with such a flattering foot. Well, I'm a creepy, pervy guy. That might have given you the impression that you can't just give a genuine compliment but that is definitely not the case. Simple direct compliments can be very well received especially when they are earned, specific in nature, and pertain to something that the other person identifies with. Watch here as Paul compliments Sean Evans after his Hot Ones interview. I must say, though, it's a great idea. It's a great construct for an interview. Thank you. I think you're an excellent interviewer. Let's go through that checklist. This compliment is earned since it does come after the interview. It's fairly specific since he's complimenting Sean's interviewing skills though mentioning a particular question could probably make Sean feel even better and it relates to Sean's identity because he created Hot Ones and presumably works very hard on it. If Paul had genuinely complimented his choice of clothing, that might not have meant a lot to him though it would in the case of someone who spends a lot of time thinking about fashion. The point is that when complimenting someone directly, you can get the most bang for your buck if you check these three boxes and the best way to put this into practice is by simply getting in the habit of complimenting someone out loud whenever you think a positive thought in your head. It'll give you great opportunities to practice during the day and it'll help push your comfort zone. Now, this isn't to say you always have to check all three boxes. In fact, an area where less specific compliments can still be highly appreciated is when speaking about someone who isn't present like here. And then he gave me a pair of headphones. Wow. I love him. I love all of these people. That guy cracks me up. He's the best. He's the best guy. No joke, I mean... When you talk about people who are absent in a positive way, you avoid that tension from the direct compliment entirely since the recipient isn't there. But more importantly, you're showing that you have positive things to say about people even when you're away from them — that you're not the type of person who is only going to be gossiping as soon as someone turns their back and trust me, the people who are present will notice. Now, this takes us to yet another way that Paul makes people feel good and that's by turning questions around. As a celebrity, he often finds himself as the center of attention especially during interviews but instead of just going with the flow, he likes to invert that social dynamic by sometimes turning the interview around and asking questions of his own to the interviewer like here. Can I ask you some questions? Whatever you want. Because I think that you are the most fascinating character in this setup. How many of these have you done? Where are you from? Chicago, originally. Right, that's where you started. Are you a sports fan like Bears? Got any brothers or sisters? I do have a younger brother named Gavin. What does Gavin do? Now, Hot Ones is a more open interview format but you also see it with Paul from time to time on standard television appearances... I have a question for you. Yes, go right ahead. ...and in radio broadcasts. What's one of yours? What's an unpopular opinion that you... Of course, this doesn't only apply to celebrities during interviews. When you find yourself at the center of attention, try to see if someone in your social group is being left out of the conversation and then ask them a question. It could be the one that was just asked of you. When you're inclusive towards other people, it shows that you're willing to share the spotlight and that makes people enjoy your company more and you can apply the same principle to people in service roles who might be expected to ask about you and instead, you just turn the question on them — to your barber, doctor, waiter, or waitress. Now, this brings us to the mindset that ties everything together. So far, whatever we've talked about has been about showing consideration towards other people be it through affectionate touch, supportive humor, complimenting them, or putting them into the spotlight and we all kind of know these things but might find it hard nonetheless because we see being special as a zero-sum game. Of course, we all want to be special and because we might not feel it often enough, we can become quietly competitive in conversation — steamrolling other people's stories, baiting for people to compliment us, or withholding kindness until someone has given it to us. We subtly fight for recognition and the validation that we crave. Now, none of this needs to be overtly hostile but it all comes at the expense of others since we can't all be in the spotlight at the same time. As paradoxical as it may seem, one of the best ways to get other people to think you are special is to find ways to put others in the spotlight. The examples in this video are a great start and perhaps the best way to get the positive feeling that comes from being special is to drop the need to feel special in the first place. That's what genuine confidence looks like. It's feeling good about yourself whether you just made the whole room crack up or someone else did. Then, you won't be tempted to have covert competitions in interactions. Elevating others becomes natural because it costs you nothing. Even better, it doesn't detract from your position but quietly enhances it. And if you're interested in the fastest way that I know of to build this social confidence and charisma, I would definitely recommend checking out our program, Charisma University. It'll give you the step-by-step daily guidance on how to become more confident and charismatic in just 30 days time. Now, you can read all about that in the link below but as usual, I like to let you know what the course is about by letting the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few things that past CU members have written in. First, thanks so much for creating Charisma University. This is a game-changer that changed how I approach my boss, my peers, and strangers. It gave me the guts to stand up for myself and others, start a business, and engage with others. Even after the 30-day program, I still feel like there is so much track to run on and I'm just getting started. This next one comes from a guy who says Charisma University helped his dating life and he says, Hi, Charlie. Firstly, loving your course. I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation section. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked someone for over a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was just too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now, we are dating. And this last one comes from someone who started a new job saying, I wanted to let you know that I nailed those first days at work. Everything that I needed was right there at the moment — the confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset, and with all your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it could just not go wrong. And he finishes by saying, I wanted to emphasize that what I did the previous days would not even have come to my mind if I had not discovered that charisma is a skill that can be learned thanks to your YouTube channel and university program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"A recent Ben Shapiro interview has gotten a lot of attention. In case you haven't seen it, Ben got into a heated argument with BBC's Andrew Neil and eventually walked out of the interview. I, you know, I'm not inclined to continue an interview with a person as badly motivated as you as an interviewer so I think we're done here. I appreciate your time. All right, well, wait... Now, Ben is no stranger to these kinds of arguments so it was surprising to see how many people felt like he lost or was even, quote-unquote, destroyed. So in this video, we're going to break down what went wrong for Ben and talk about four things that you can do to avoid any embarrassment in an argument like that. So, getting started, we first need to talk about body language and speech patterns because even though we don't often think about it, this kind of behavior is one of the most important factors in shaping a conversation. There's two main types that you will see in your life — argumentative and collaborative behavior. Argumentative is when you're trying to win against the other person. Collaborative, where you're striving towards a common goal. And in the Ben Shapiro interview, we see several examples of this argumentative style. I just asked you a question. And I asked you a question and you failed to answer a single one of mine. Frankly, I find this whole thing a waste of time. Let's start out with Ben's posture. Throughout the interview, he often leans forward and tends to lower his head. Contrast this with Jordan Peterson in the Kathy Newman interview where he leans back in a more relaxed posture. Now, leaning back appears more collaborative because it signals that you are not in fight-or-flight mode. You don't perceive yourself as threatened so the other person can relax because nothing bad is going to happen. Now, leaning forward, especially after things have gotten heated, signals that the other person needs to keep their eye on you — you are on the ready. Now, this isn't always a bad thing. Without all the other signals, just leaning forward conveys that you're interested. But if you're in a conversation that shows these signs of becoming heated, assuming a more relaxed posture can help steer it away from an argument. Another thing that you'll notice about Ben's body language is that he frequently smirks. New policies — the Medicare for all, $15 minimum wage, Georgia, new abortion laws. Ben Shapiro destroys transgenderism. In a genuine smile, the eyes will show tension while just about everything else in the face with the exception of your mouth is relaxed. Sometimes, your jaw will even be open. And we interpret these genuine smiles positively because, first, the tension around the eyes is hard to fake so you know it's real and, second, it's incredibly open — you cannot really hide a smile. A smirk, on the other hand, is a partial contraction and this is something that might happen when you're trying to restrain laughter. It can often be interpreted by other people as if you think that you are superior and when someone is on the other side of a smirk, they often don't appreciate it. And you can smirk at me and you can laugh at me. I'm not smirking. So if you're in a situation where the other person is upset, do not smirk. Try not to restrain any emotion — show it clearly on your face. If you're going to smile, smile and if not, keep it really tight. The smirk is likely to upset them. Now, the next thing that can promote more argumentative versus collaborative behavior is the way that you answer questions. You can do it literally or you can be playful. And there's nothing wrong with answering questions literally especially when things are going well. But when you're in an argument, being playful is often much to your advantage because it shows the other person that you aren't singularly focused on winning points with every single exchange. You draw focus away from those contentious points as Russell Brand shows in this next clip. Gandhi, go. I hope that's not your message to Gandhi and the people of India. You know, it's funny though because I travel a lot. Well, these people are at work, are they? Yeah, they're working. They're just at work. Work more quietly! And by the way, based on all of your feedback, we will have a full breakdown of that Russell Brand interview on the channel soon. The higher level point here is that if someone is making a remark at your expense or if things start to get heated, try to go in a joking direction like Russell did. Imagine if Ben had gone with that same attitude in this next exchange. Why are you picking out random YouTube videos put up by people who are not me? Are you attributing the titles to me? Ben could have playfully teased Andrew for not really knowing how the internet works and if he'd done it in a light-hearted way with a genuine smile, it would have put some separation between the frustrating points they had in that moment which is likely to make everything that comes after go more smoothly. Now, continuing, we also see from Ben frequently that he often speaks very quickly. If you want to read the book and critique the book, why don't you read and critique the book? If you want to critique me, you can think whatever you want of me. Frankly, I don't care. I don't frankly give a damn what you think of me since I've never heard of you. There's nothing necessarily wrong with speaking quickly in and of itself. Combined with everything else, though, it might take you in a direction that you don't want to go. The advantage of speaking slowly in contentious situations is that it gives people time to absorb your ideas. They don't feel like they're being foisted upon them but always speaking fast makes it seem like your ideas are being forced on other people. They don't have time to absorb, reflect, or react and when they don't have enough time to respond, it can make them feel stupid as Joe Rogan points out. Ben talks super fast because when he talks super fast, it's really hard to keep up with him and he sounds smarter than you. He's very smart and articulate and he talks fast. It's like, woo, it's hard to handle. And it should go without saying that when somebody feels stupid in your presence, they're more likely to not want to work with you. Now, in addition to speaking fast, Ben's voice also remains fairly flat in terms of its intonation. Yes, I would vote for Mr. Trump if it were a race between Biden and Trump because I think that the damage that President Trump has done to the country on a character and rhetorical level... Again, this is a very common habit of Ben's. There's nothing wrong with it but it does serve the purpose that he is normally doing which he sees in an argument going back and forth. He's not using softening inflections to change his pitch. Now, we do those softening inflections when we're enthusiastic or when we're joking or when we want others to feel comfortable around us like you might have felt in that last sentence. A pitch change can also be used at the end of a statement to completely change the feeling. Listen to how Jordan Peterson responds to Cathy's question here. You don't believe in equal pay. No, I'm not saying that at all. Imagine if he had said the same thing like this instead. No, that's not what I'm saying at all. That would have come across as much more argumentative because that downward inflection at the end indicates that it's a command — you're telling someone how you're feeling and you're probably not feeling too good about it. When we use an upward inflection instead, it sounds more like a question or an invitation — kind of like this. The problem here is that you don't want to just go with one or the other. There are, of course, times to use the upward and the downward. Most of the time, it's going to be instinctual but when you are in an argumentative situation, there is an advantage to using that upward inflection if you're trying to de-escalate things. All that said, it is important to note that Andrew Neil was also displaying a lot of the same argumentative body language and tonalities throughout this interview. Is this so hard for you? Why can't you just be honest? Seriously, it's a serious question. Mr. Shapiro, if you only knew how ridiculous that statement is, you wouldn't have said it. Both men pushed the conversation forward in a way that predictably escalated into what you might call a heated discussion and when you're on TV, this can be advantageous. It might give you a chance to humiliate your opponent and get famous on YouTube but for most of us, the best way to resolve an argument is to find common ground before it gets too heated so lean towards that collaborative style and dismantle it before you get to where we're headed. Now, what determines if something that gets heated winds up as a full-blown verbal fight is the mindset that is going into it, namely, whether both parties feel like they're on the same or different teams. When you have the mindset that you're on the same team as the person you're talking to, your goal is to try to find common ground. It doesn't matter necessarily how you get there but when you perceive that you're on different teams, the goal is to win. They have to be destroyed or come to your original position. And if you're not sure of someone else's mindset, I recommend that you assume for as long as you can that you are on the same team. Part of that means that you need to be charitable when you're trying to assume their motivations. Don't read their mind and insist that you know why they're doing what they're doing as Ben does here with Andrew. Why don't you just say that you're on the left? Is this so hard for you? Why can't you just be honest? Because Ben won't take Andrew at his word, he gets frustrated perceiving this as another example of the media being biased against his positions which is something he feels like happens frequently but this host has actually had a long history with conservative news and if you look at other interviews, you see that he uses the same type of prodding questioning with those on the left. Ben was actually wrong and this is a good reason why you shouldn't assume malintent or read minds. You will very frequently as certain as you are be wrong. Now, one downside of this is that it alienates people regardless as we saw in the video that we did with Brie Larson. Is that like a personal attack or something? Worse, assuming malintent when you're dealing with someone else in an argumentative style reinforces the frame that you're on different teams. You're perceiving it that way, you're putting them in that bucket and it moves the discussion towards a full-blown verbal throwdown which often leads to insults. Now, the difference between an insult and an argument is that the insult is about the individual instead of their content and it's aimed at proving superiority rather than finding common ground as you see here. The fact that I'm popular and no one has ever heard of you. In addition to just offending people, insults actually make things worse for you because they don't give other people a way to save face if they've actually had their mind changed to your side. You are much benefited by creating a path back to civil conversation, a path to seeing things in your own way without the other person feeling ashamed. Now, Russell Brand does this by not calling the host out directly in his interview with MSNBC, at least, not at first. He talks instead about people who purposely misinterpret him in the third person — firing a warning shot that gives the host a chance to change their tact while not overtly feeling shamed. Challenges in all of those different disciplines — the thing I enjoy most is stand-up comedy because you're direct with your audience. You can't be misinterpreted, people can't get confused. You know what happens if you work in media — people like to change the information so that it suits a particular agenda. If you're in a room with people, then what you're saying is clear. If you say something that people are confused about, you can explain it to them then. If you say something because it's a joke, people can't pretend that you're saying it seriously. So I like having direct communication with people because I believe people are very, very intelligent but the information gets manipulated a lot and people like to cause fake stirs and stuff. Contrast that with Ben who does start using insults and try to imagine someone coming around to your side of things after you say this. You know, honestly, this is a giant waste of time. All that to say, even if you feel like you have a real zinger, don't use insults — they don't benefit you. But let's say it's too late — insults have already been thrown around, now we're in a verbal fight. And this is where Ben really lost. This is why people feel like he was destroyed and it actually has nothing to do with the merit of the points being debated because when you are in a verbal fight, schoolyard wisdom prevails. The quality of the argument doesn't matter. What matters is who acts like they are winning and there are several traits that we look for as audience to judge this. First off, we're trying to see who is least emotionally affected. Typically speaking, the winner of any altercation is going to be calmer because he's happy with the position that he's in. So when we see someone who's upset, we assume that what was said against them must have some merit — they must be losing. Ben reveals how much Andrew is affecting him with his emotional outbursts. I don't frankly give a damn what you think of me since I've never heard of you. Now, some people use emotional outbursts to actually control a situation kind of like Conor McGregor who seems to switch from calm to very upset back to calm but that's actually part of it. He's not genuinely upset and the ability to get heated and then quickly calm down is incredibly valuable if you want to look like you're winning in an argument. Quentin Tarantino displays it really well in an alter interview. First, getting into a heated argument over a question about violence in his movies — It's my job to try and ask you to — And I'm shutting your butt down. And that's entirely your — but then when the host gives up and moves on to a new topic, he moves on as well — doesn't seem to bring it up again or be affected by it. Well, I think I'm still in the sweet spot. Well, I hope. You know, that's up to everyone to decide. So keep your emotions in check or at the very least, bring them back to baseline as fast as you can. Now, the second thing we look for when deciding who is actually winning is who doesn't resort to attacking or taking things off subject. When you pull away from the current topic of conversation, it appears to an audience as if you don't have a solid answer. And when Ben dodges questions and turn the back on Andrew, we get that same impression. You're lecturing me on Judeo-Christian culture after you called the pro-life position barbaric? We're also looking to see who is fidgeting less. Now, Ben actually does a pretty good job here of steadying himself. He takes a deep breath but we do see some hints of discomfort come through at the end. Compared to Andrew, though, he is far more uncomfortable with stillness. ...to produce. That's my point that you write about, you know, Judeo-Christian culture and so on but so much of what you've said in the past would seem to turn its back on Judeo-Christian culture. In a contentious Robert Downey Jr. interview, the host is extremely fidgety and Robert even calls him out on it. I'm not agreeing. Your foot's starting to jump a little bit. You better get to your next question. The fourth thing that we're looking for is to see who comfortably talks more over the other person, who is ceding power willingly. Now, Ben allows himself to speak and then continually be interrupted by Andrew while he plows over him with his words. Society is turning its back on Judeo-Christian values. What are the values it's turning its back on? It's not a rational rule of thumb but when we see someone dominate a conversation like that, we assume that they're winning so a good rule of thumb for you is to only speak when you fully intend on finishing your sentence. Otherwise, stay quiet and wait for the right opportunity to come in strongly. So I hope that helps you to understand what kind of went down in the Ben Shapiro interview and how you might avoid a similar fate in your own life. There's also a number of related videos that we have to this topic. The first one covers that Robert Downey Jr. interview in depth if you want to check that out. The second one, that recent Brie Larson interview which covers mal-intent interpreting and the third are Ben's tactics when they're at their best because at least in the eyes of the internet, he's often on the other side of the destroying. Also, we have that Russell Brand video with MSNBC coming. So if you want to make sure that you do not miss it, go ahead and click Subscribe now.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"It has been a minute and it's good to be back. So today, what we're going to be doing is taking a look at the man, the myth, the legend, Tony Robbins. And we're actually going to be trying to figure out some habits to change your life for the better because quite frankly, some crazy times right now. You've probably been feeling it. I've been feeling it. And anything that can help you feel better on a regular basis is worth looking into. So let's dive into Tony Robbins and what he's got to say. People come to me all the time and they'll come up to me like this and they'll go, I don't know what it is. I just feel down all the time. Why do you think I feel that way? So I feel so up. Why do you think I feel so up all the time? I don't know what it is, but for some reason, I'm angry all the time. Do we get in habits of using our body, our face in a certain way over and over again? Yes or no? Once you're in that state, you'll behave in a way that creates more of that emotion. This is a hundred percent the truth. Anytime that I'm ready to give a speech or anything like that beforehand, I get out there and I jump up and down. I bang my chest. I make sure that I'm communicating a lot with all of the people backstage beforehand so that I go on and it looks like I can turn it on, but quite frankly, I started turning on five, ten minutes prior so that when I hit that moment where I need to perform, and for you, this can be an interview, this might be a date that you're going on. One of the things that you can do if you find yourself in a situation where you have a nervous phone call coming up, be it with a boss, someone that you're excited to talk to, whatever, is to get moving prior. So I like to often do those phone calls when I'm on a walk outside or at least be moving around my apartment, preferably if I've had a conversation shortly before that so I'm in the mode of communicating, it helps a ton. And I think that there's a lot to this two-way street between the way that you feel and the way that you move your body. I watched this the first time. He is so intense compared to Russell Brand in this one. You know how people negotiate, well, maybe I'll do it tomorrow, I'm going to do this, or let me wait two more minutes till I'm ready. There's none of that shit with me. For decades, I go, I say, we do. I'm not here to discuss this shit with my mind. There's mind and there's soul and spirit. And soul and spirit, my soul knows. And when I say jump, you jump. So I think this is really useful information, this idea of no discussion. We're going to do this thing that I've pre-resolved to do. I'm going to stick to my commitments. There's a lot of value in that for a lot of people at various points in their life. But I will say this is something that I don't totally disagree with. If you're a type A person and you've got this and you've internalized, you got to go, go, go, go, go. I actually think getting in touch with the part of you that doesn't want to do the thing and finding out what's going on in that emotional area where you don't want to jump in the cold plunge, you're not committed to optimizing every area of your life, that part needs to be listened to. Not because it's a complainer or it's dragging you down but because it often has some very, very important things for you to hear. You want to come back now? Make a decision. What makes you hate yourself? Is it the red shoes? What? Is it the red shoes? No. Are you sure? Because they're f***ing red. You smile like that too much, you don't want to stick around. You've been so hard on yourself. I love that you have such high standards. But those aren't high standards, that's called perfection. And most people overestimate what they can do in a year. So I think what's actually fascinating about this clip is there's almost a hypnotic sense to what is happening here. So look into it. I think a lot of people believe that hypnotism is fake when they see it on stage, it is not. You can induce people into trances, they become more suggestible and you can use that to help them, do all sorts of things. If Tony had come up to him and said all of this to him in a different setting without that sort of preamble, that warm-up to that heightened suggestibility, there's nothing about these words that is necessarily going to break through that guy's defense mechanism. And I think what Tony Robbins events do extremely well is they take people out of their comfort zone, they get them moving around, and it puts them into a state where they are open to change. And quite frankly, this is what all of the best organizations at creating change do to people. In one way or another, they put them in a state where they're receptive to change. If you look at boot camp, they keep you extremely tired. That is not an accident. It's not because they just don't want you to sleep. It's because that is what enables them to, as they say, break you down and build you back up into a soldier. A decision is the first step. Decision is like a war. I got to do this or that. All right, I'm going to make myself do this. But commitment is when you now, after you've decided, you commit to do this for the long term. Whether it's hard or easy doesn't matter. You're doing this. It takes it from this moment, and it carries it into the future even when things are difficult. So I don't know if he's going to say it here, but one thing that he said, gosh, I don't know, it must have been 8 to 10 years ago, that stuck with me and really affected me was never leave the site of a decision without doing something that carries you forward to the next time. So oftentimes, I'd find that I resolved to, at that time in my life, it was go to the gym more or eat healthier or whatever it was, and I'd have these frequent moments of inspiration, but they wouldn't stick. And that one idea that, okay, as soon as I make this decision, what I need to do right now is, for instance, if I'm going to eat better, I have to go to my kitchen and throw out all the junk food right now. Whatever it was that I could do to commit myself— Hey, lady, it's okay. Whatever I could do to commit myself forward counted for a ton at that time. It's okay, lady. The only thing that changes your life is making a decision. So while you're in this passionate state, that's where you make decisions, you know? I'm going to interrupt right now. My dog has come to say hello. She's pretty sad right now. Listen to Tony Robbins' voice. While you're in this passionate state, that's where you make decisions. So one habit that I don't think he's going to say outright, but I know he's practiced, is the way that you speak, my gosh, if you're going to do as much public speaking as Tony Robbins does, you need to learn to speak from your diaphragm. If you want to find out there's basic singing lessons, I can link to a video, but if you're speaking primarily and it feels like you're speaking from your throat, you will chew up your vocal cords. And if you listen to Tony's voice over the course of his life, it has deteriorated greatly. So just to keep in mind, one thing that you absolutely need to do if you're going to be doing a lot of public speaking, look into basic singing lessons, looking to speaking from your diaphragm. I'll show you the difference real quick. And now when I speak from this, you can hear that my voice is naturally lower, versus when I start speaking up here, which is my natural voice sometimes if I haven't done these practices and I can do this for short periods of time as can everybody, you'll start to chew up your vocal cords. It's something that he's done. I know he regrets it. So keep that in mind. I'm not here because I believe in positive thinking. If you think that's what I believe, you don't know much about me. I'm not one of those people that believes you're supposed to go to your garden and chant, there's no weeds, there's no weeds, there's no weeds, Yeah, so this is one that I've gone back and forth on in my life, but I'm in agreement. I think that positive thinking shouldn't be thrown out the window, but quite frankly, I think that people that all the time feel like they have to say the most positive thing, do the most positive thing, do their gratitude exercises all the time, that stuff has a place, but what it sometimes stops you from doing is investigating some of the things that are consistently frustrating, annoying, and upsetting to you, and what you put on top of it, and I think sometimes Tony stuff can be a little bit guilty of this, but it can be a thin veil of positivity. And so, yeah, I'm 100% about being real with the problems in your life, and I think that makes a ton of sense. I should work harder, I should make more calls, I should, I should, I should, I should. You know what? People don't do their shoulds, and they get mad at themselves, and they what I call should all over themselves. They beat themselves up about it. What changes people is when your should becomes a must. I agree, and this is a big one. I'll give him credit. This might be one of the number one or at least the top things. 100% agree. Now, I think he's going to elaborate here on how to do this. Let's see. It's like if you want to take the island, and you're the head of the army, and you want to take the island, the most powerful way to take the island is burn the boats because if there's no way to go back, it's amazing what happens when it's a must. If you're a younger person, and you're in your 20s, or at any point in your life where you're trying to build something, this is fantastic, fantastic advice. But if you're at a point where you have been a type A achiever for some time, I don't necessarily think that raising your standards is the answer. Now, I think there's an interesting tension between this very Western ideal of like achieve, you have to go get it, and how does that blend with this Eastern philosophy of allow life to come your way, recognize that ultimately, you cannot control things, and if you try to control the world around you, you're really just going to let your emotions be dictated by things outside of your control because you will never be able to one-to-one mold the world the way that you think it ought to be no matter how high your standards are. So, I hope that has been helpful, a handful of habits for you to change your life, and as you kind of saw in this, there's a handful of points where I am not 100% in agreement. Not to say that Tony's stuff is bad, I think it's absolutely fantastic, I'd recommend it to tons of people, I've sent family members to his events, but I think there's something to acknowledging and exploring your emotional reality, especially if you're a type A person that raised your standards and doesn't accept no for an answer, and it's go, go, go, what are you going to achieve, what's next, what's bigger. I find that in my own life, that has caused me to move the goalposts of happiness such that my standards are rising, I'm achieving at a higher level, I've got everything on the outside going the way that I wanted to, but the internal state of how much happiness am I experiencing or joy hasn't necessarily changed, and if I'm honest, when I've been in that state, what's been driving me is anxiety, what's been driving me is a fear that I need to do more, more, more. So, with that in mind, the part of the reason that I have been gone, and quite frankly, the whole reason that I've been gone is because I've spent the last several months redoing the emotional mastery course that I had before, which was intended to sort of approach this problem and start to find a different way of handling things rather than achieve, achieve, achieve. And the idea of the course, redone completely, I'm extremely proud of it, is that it's a 24-day course to help you feel more positive emotions and be less controlled by those negative ones. And again, it's not just the positive thinking, it's not about avoiding it in 90 seconds to changing it, it really is about going into it, finding some of the root causes of feelings that you might not even be acknowledging, addressing subconscious drivers that are controlling you, limiting you in your life, and getting them out of the way. So, I'm extremely, extremely proud of this course. It's not necessarily one that I think fits with what most people are looking for, but it is the one that I think has the most positive impact, at least that I am capable of creating. So, if you want to check that course out, it is up live now. If you had previously joined emotional mastery, it's completely included. The update is 100% new. All 24 days are brand new. The old stuff is still there as well. So, I hope that you decide to check emotional mastery out. Like I said, I'm super proud of it. It comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, and I hope to see you on the inside. Either way, I'm back. You'll probably see me a little bit more on the channel. I have appreciated Ben filling in for me. In the meantime, either way, I hope that you enjoyed this video, and I will see you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 679}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Our minds are littered with booby traps and if we're not careful, we fall into one of those traps and all of a sudden, it becomes harder to feel happy and to develop yourself further. And that's why in this video, I want to give you five tricks that your mind is playing on you all the time and what you can do to escape those today. So the first one is the free trap. The free trap is when you think that because something has no monetary cost, it therefore has no costs of any kind and you've seen this before. This is the people who line up for two hours outside of a new restaurant that's giving out $10 worth of food and they're doing it because the food is free. Now, unfortunately, what has happened is because they hear that word free and they go crazy, all of a sudden, they think their time is worthless. Now, it's likely that you do this too. I know I do. You sign up for a free email newsletter not thinking about the space in your inbox and how it's going to slow you down in the future or even really if you're interested in reading it. Your friend is throwing something out. They say, do you want this? You say, sure, and all of a sudden, it gets put in your closet just to clutter up your space. Or somebody has tickets to a sporting event that you don't care about, a concert for the band that you don't really like, and you take them. You're super excited and then you're waiting in traffic for an hour to go to an event that you're not that interested in, you didn't have fun at, but you do it all over again the next time you get the free tickets. The way out of this free trap to stop wasting your time and mental space on things that don't make you happy but you're just compelled towards is the $1 solution. It's very simple. Anytime something feels free, you're signing up for that newsletter, ask yourself, would I pay just $1 for this? Would I pay $1 for this email newsletter? If it's yes, sign up. But if not, it's probably not worth the dollar and therefore, it's not worth the time. Your time is so much more valuable than that $1. So going to the $1 solution will save you a lot of trouble, it'll keep you mentally clear, and quite frankly, make it easier to be happy spending time doing the things that you love. The second thing, much harder to catch in ourselves, is projection. Now, projection, you've seen this on television, it's the person who is screaming about homosexual behavior, how it needs to be curbed, stop, they have conversion camps, and then in the news, three months later, it comes out that they're engaging in all of these same behaviors that they have screamed out against. Projection is when we have something inside of ourselves that we can't deal with internally and in order to cope, we have to externalize the problem. We say the problem isn't coming from inside of me, it's out in the world and therefore, I can fix it out in the world. Now, this is tough to catch in yourself. It's very easy to see other people who have a problem and think, oh, everyone else is angry, everyone else is a jerk. But with yourself, the way you can start digging into this is to ask yourself what your most common judgments are about the world and people at large. So if you think that the world is really sad, news is so sad all the time, or if you think that people are idiots, god, they're always doing dumb stuff, it's likely that you haven't integrated those aspects of yourself so you're seeing them in something as big as the world because quite frankly, there's 8 billion people, they're not all stupid, you could focus on any aspect of it. The aspect that you choose to focus on in the world which is full of beauty or in people which are completely varied is the aspect that is coloring your lenses of viewing that world. So when you dig in, you go, wow, I think that the world is sad all the time or whatever it is, it's likely that you haven't integrated your own sadness. If you think that people are stupid, it's likely that you're having trouble integrating the fact that you can be boneheaded some of the time. Now, this is tough to do but if you ask yourself this question when judgments arise, number one, self-righteous anger goes out the window, it can deflate you very quickly but two, you start to grow in the ways that are most important to you. These are your biggest blind spots and projection can actually be a great tool for catching them. Now the third one is social proof. Social proof is a great thing. You hear that all your friends are eating at some restaurant, it's really good, you go try it, you like it, social proof worked, excellent. The problem is when we begin to put social proof and authority in front of our own experience when it comes to determining what we do. So this is an example I talked about on the podcast if you haven't seen it. We have a podcast on another channel on YouTube and I was telling the story of a family in my neighborhood where I grew up and they're having a wedding for their daughter and the day after the wedding, they're having this big event with bocce ball. It's going to be a big expensive thing and sort of a Hamptons-esque area and they're going to play bocce ball and I thought that was interesting because bocce ball, if you haven't seen it, you throw one little ball and you got to get a bigger ball close to it. We've all played it in my neighborhood growing up once and everybody played it once because nobody really likes bocce ball. It's not that fun, it's kind of like horseshoes with balls and quite frankly, people have better things to do. But they're going to spend probably strong five figures in order to have this at their wedding event because it is socially cool. It's going to make for a good Instagram photo and they've seen that the well-to-do have done this at their weddings before. This is a strong example of social proof and authority coloring what we would like to do because these people I happen to know would probably never have picked bocce ball as the event that they would do on any other day of their life and they're not going to enjoy it on that day. So pay attention particularly to what you're consuming in social media because what social media tells you will make you happy is pretty-looking meals or walking on the beach in some foreign country and especially if you're looking behind at a disembodied person whose hand you're holding while you smile. If you've ever seen those people out traveling, they are not having a good time while they focus on their photos and if you focus on your own experience like me, what you'll probably see is that the day-to-day things that contribute to your happiness and those are what you want to aim for. It's my walks in the afternoon that I would never take a photo of that most fill me up. So don't find yourself waiting at clubs to be in VIP tables where no one's happy because you think that's the case. Refer to your own experience and you will make choices that make you happier in the long run. Now the fourth thing, this one is very counterintuitive because we all want to live in integrity. The problem comes when our identities become so strong that we choose integrity over honesty. I'll give you an example from my own life. When I see people in relationships that aren't good for them, it's very easy being on the outside for me to say, oh wow, they should just break up. I know it's scary but that's what you should do and I said this many times about many different people and I believe that that was the right advice. Well, what happened in my life is that I got into a relationship and then it turned not so good and all of the advice that I had given the other people was starting to apply to me. So what did I do here? Did I take my advice and leave? Well, no, I couldn't. Did I admit that it was more difficult? No. What I said was that no, my relationship is not like the other ones that I was commenting on for XYZ BS reasons and this is what we all do. We struggle so hard to remain consistent with the things that we've said that we sacrifice honesty. We put integrity so we have to match what we said before with what we're living and we just give up on the fact that we're not even collecting the right data. Now the way out of this is going to sound crazy and it's to allow yourself to be hypocritical. A lot of people think that hypocrisy is a sign of being less developed and quite frankly, recognizing your hypocrisy is a huge step to becoming a more thoughtful self-aware person. We are all hypocritical in our own ways and it comes down to admitting it and allowing yourself, in my case, to say, look, everything that I said about those other couples I believe is true. I believe it applies to me and I'm not going to follow my own advice because it's too scary and it would hurt too much to do so and I'm going to pay the price at some point but here I am. That step is massive, massive, massive so allow yourself to give up being perfectly integrous with your principles and the values and all of the things that you want to live up to and instead, start from the bedrock of honesty. Where are you today and what ways are you failing those values and principles and actually, that puts you on a path to, over the long run, starting to achieve them in a meaningful way. Now the fifth thing, we often try because we lack imagination and we don't recognize how abundant the world can be. When we lose something, when we lose love, when we lose money, we try to recapture it in the same way that we lost it. This is the guy at the casino who lost $100 and he's trying to win it back at the casino rather than going to something that might work but for instance, I have, in the past, there's been gyms, for instance, that have overbilled me for a month. So say I lost $50 at this gym and I want to get that $50 back and I'll know that they're going to make it a headache so I'll argue with them on the phone, I'll go in, I'll talk to the manager and before you know it, I've spent 3-4 hours trying to recover $50 when a much easier thought might have been, Okay, I'm bummed I lost $50. Do I have anything that I've been meaning to donate or sell that I could put on Craigslist to recover that $50 and be made whole without having to track down these crazy managers who do not want to give me my money back? I'm not saying that you should never fight for money. I'm saying that you should ask yourself in any situation, are there alternative routes to get to what I want to make myself feel whole again? When I had the breakup, eventually, after that relationship that I mentioned, I started trying to date again. I wanted to date that particular woman and then I wanted to date other people and one of the things that worked best and made me feel the best after this relationship was buying a new video game to play with my brother who happens to be sitting here right now. That video game was Divinity. It was amazing and it made me feel connected. I had a great time with it. So the question is whenever you feel like you've lost something, a friend, money, a job, whatever, it's not how do I get that particular thing back, it's what else could I do that might be more interesting and fun to make myself feel whole again? And oftentimes, you get better solutions than the thing that you lost. Charlie from the future cutting in here, I forgot to mention that you should check out our new podcast. So if you haven't seen it, it's called the Charlie and Ben Podcast. It's a chance for me and my co-founder, Ben, to go deeper into topics that we cover here on the channel as well as a lot of stuff that we can't always cover here — so philosophy, deeper things about psychology, sometimes politics. So if you'd like to check that out either here on YouTube or on Apple, Spotify, wherever they have podcasts, you can do so by searching the Charlie and Ben Podcast or just click somewhere around the screen right now and I'll send you to a clip so you can see if it's up your alley. I hope that you decide to do that because I'm having a ton of fun with it. Either way, I hope that you enjoyed the video and I will see you in the next one.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"With his popular new YouTube channel, Some Good News, John Krasinski is showing how powerful it can be to combine humility, positivity, and humor. So in this video, we'll be covering five ways John is able to make people laugh that you can use in any situation from school to work to dates that will get people to instantly like you more. At the end, we'll also cover a major mistake most people make and how you can avoid it. The first secret to John's charm is that he uses go-to stories. When he finds a story that gets a laugh, he uses it again. Watch as he tells the same story on both Jimmy Kimmel and Graham Norton. And he said, um, it says here that you're an actor. And I said, yeah. And he said, would I know you from anything? I went, you know, we redid the UK version of The Office. Oh, I love that show. He says, who are you visiting here? I said, my wife. And he says, is she an actress? And I said, yeah. He said, would I know her? I said, I don't know. And he said, what's her name? And I said, Emily Blunt, as he was writing something. And he went, you? You? You married Emily Blunt? And I go, yeah. And he goes like this. Okay, go. So the next time you tell a story that gets a great reaction, make a mental note to yourself. Having a handful of stories you know get a laugh will instantly boost your confidence in conversation. Just be mindful you don't use the same story over and over with the same audience. Beyond that, John does something very specific during the jokes in his stories that guarantees he gets a laugh. He acts out his characters. Watch as John tells the story of how he and his wife met President Obama. He was so nervous to meet him that he said, oh, hey, how you doing? Oh my gosh, I really love what you do. God, I love all your movies. And she went, and I said, Emily, and she was like, wait, wait, and so I was like, you're acting very dumb. And he goes, can't forget about this guy. I love The Office. And I went, playing the characters in your stories is one of the fastest ways to take a bland story and make it laugh out loud funny. And it's much easier than it looks. There are two key things to play with if you want to play a character, your body and your voice. For an easy example, watch how John makes use of his hands in order to add absurdity to this next joke. You are a proper fan of it. Oh, I was full stalker status. Yeah, I was just like, hey, you want to go on a date with me? Imagine if John told that joke without using his hands. It wouldn't have been nearly as funny. You'll see in this next clip how John can use his entire body to get a laugh, too. Hazel's teacher says, hey, Violet, want to come in the classroom and talk for a bit? That was the first time she knew it was about her. And she turned to my wife and went, oh, my God. John takes his physical comedy even further by altering his voice as well. And I was like, oh, you know, I was like running on some rooftops. And then like a guy jumps into the Thames and he was like, really? That's absolutely wonderful. Good for you. Fantastic. Fantastic. Now, we aren't all actors like John, but specifically with funny stories, the good news is that your impressions don't even have to be good. Just clearly move and speak as someone different than yourself and you will get a bigger laugh. If this seems like it would be hard to remember on the spot, then one easy trick is to set a phone reminder before your next social event, reminding yourself to play the characters in your jokes. It may sound strange, but it'll make your night way more fun. And you will notice people start to be drawn to you as you tell your stories. One common theme you'll notice in John's jokes so far is he's not worried about making himself look good. By making jokes about stalking his wife or crying in front of Obama, John shows he's comfortable using self-deprecating humor to get a laugh. Watch as he talks about taking his wife to the gun range for the first date. We were experiencing it for the first time, which was pretty great, except I, I think, yelped the first time. I was like, Most people in conversation are trying to make themselves look good. By making a joke at your own expense, you immediately separate yourself from that pack. Now, some people worry that self-deprecating jokes will make them look bad by calling attention to their flaws. And this can happen if you don't do it correctly. So there's two good rules to follow. One option is to make a self-deprecating joke that is obviously not true. Take this example of John with Ellen. Name the celebrity who hasn't returned a text you sent. Name one who has. And the second option is to make a joke that may or may not be true, but that you aren't insecure about, like this example of John talking about his wife. And how's your wife, the beautiful Emily Blunt? Fantastic. We love Emily. That reaction means I married up, and don't I know it. Don't I know it. In most instances where self-deprecating jokes go wrong, it's because someone is trying to make a joke about something that they're genuinely insecure about. They're hoping that if they bully themselves first, it will make other people bully them less. Instead, make fun of yourself for things you don't care about. A good way to know is to ask yourself, would I care if someone else made this joke about me? John is a master of the flip side of self-deprecating humor as well. He tells jokes that elevate other people. Watch this clip where Ellen is congratulating John for being honored as one of the sexiest men in America, and John turns it into a joke elevating Brad Pitt instead. To be really honest, I thought Brad Pitt was the sexiest person every year. I mean, like, he must get the phone call and he just goes, yeah, no, guys, somebody else is here and they're like, great, we just had to ask and now we'll go to somebody else, but he has to be. Most people tell jokes that put other people down, and while that may get a laugh, it also runs the risk of making people resent you. If instead, you focus on making jokes that elevate other people, you get the laugh and you strengthen the relationship with that person. The danger here is that if you do it wrong, you can end up looking like a suck-up. Nothing turns people off faster than if they think you're trying to get close to them with flattery. Because of that, there are two key elements to make a complimentary joke go well. First, your joke has to be genuine. So before attempting to jokingly elevate someone, ask yourself, what do I truly admire about this person? This will naturally help your delivery. Second, exaggerate the compliment. John doesn't just say Brad Pitt is handsome. He says he's so handsome that he gets a call from People Magazine every single year. Here's another example of John describing what it's like to meet Tom Brady. I met him and I think I realized there's a computer chip put in you, even though he wasn't playing yet. They put a computer chip in you that when you meet Tom Brady, your computer shuts off. So he was like, hey, how are you doing? I was like, pretty good. That's all I remember about meeting him. That exaggerated absurdity will make sure your compliments get a laugh. And even if the person you're talking to isn't the person you're complimenting, the positivity and confidence that you show by hyping someone else up will make them instantly like you more. There's also a second much easier technique John uses to jokingly elevate others around him. He doubles down on other people's jokes. Watch John build on Ellen's joke here and take note of Ellen's reaction. Did you write with a pen? Like a quill? He does it again here with Conan O'Brien and gets a big laugh. A lot of times, mostly in life, if someone pops out of a door and says, do you want to meet them? You say no. And then they just do this and you slowly go to bed. Doubling down is nice because you're essentially complimenting the other person by saying, hey, I like your joke. Let's keep it going. This is a great way to make people like you and it can be super fun if you start to go back and forth with each other like Graham Norton and John do here. So next time you're in conversation, instead of trying to grab the spotlight, let other people go first. Then when someone tells a joke, rather than trying to figure out how you can bring attention to yourself, ask, how can I double down on their joke to make it even funnier? If this is a skill you want to improve and you aren't quite sure how, a great first step is to watch improv shows like Whose Line Is It Anyway? Improv is based all around the idea of building on other people's jokes and simply by watching it, you will start to absorb their thought patterns. Now, this video has focused a lot on John's humor, but it's important to note he doesn't play the role of a class clown who can't be serious. When the opportunity presents itself, John will be genuine and share his emotion, specifically emotions that other men might be embarrassed about, like here where he admits to being a crier. Oh, absolutely. And I'm a crier. I have no hard time saying that and I cry at everything. Or here where he admits he was scared the first time he approached his wife. Was she intimidating at all to you? Yes, incredibly intimidating. I was scared out of my mind to even go up and say hi to her. These are feelings most people have but lack the confidence to share because they fear the judgment of others, but hiding these feelings is a big mistake. When you share emotions with people that they themselves have but try to hide, it has two positive effects. They'll admire you for sharing something vulnerable and they'll feel closer to you because they have those same feelings. If you feel like you don't have the confidence for that, I recommend checking out our program, Charisma University. It's the fastest way I know to build your charisma and confidence. It's literally guaranteed to work in just 30 days and it's structured with a daily action guide, so there's no guesswork when it comes to learning these habits. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below, but I figured the best way to let you know what this is all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written in via email or the course comments. The first one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career and he says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills, which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. Now this next one comes from another person who started a new job saying, I wanted to let you know that I nailed those first few days at work. Everything that I needed was right there at the right moment — the confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset, and with all your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it just could not go wrong. And he finishes by saying, I just wanted to emphasize that what I did the previous days would not even have come to mind if I had not discovered that charisma is a skill that can be learned thanks to your YouTube channel and university program. And this last one is a comment in the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their social and dating life and he says, Life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. And there are more success stories like those in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. And it's 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because I want to make sure that every single person truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course. Otherwise, you can just refund. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it. I hope that you decide to join if this is an area of your life that you're looking to improve. One other quick note, some of you may have noticed it's a different voice today. This is Ben from the podcast and I will be making some videos for Charisma on Command this year. So I hope you liked this one and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 612}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"There are no classes on flirting in school and unfortunately, what that means is that when you go out into the world to do it, sometimes, some weird things can escape your mouth which is why, in this video, I'm going to give you five things that you should never say when flirting you may have in the past because they're very common — no more after this video. So the first one can occur in a lot of situations. You're looking at someone's Instagram, you see they have an attractive friend, you think they might like them or you're talking alone with them and then all of a sudden, boom, competition shows up or you hear that they have this celebrity crush. In any of these scenarios, it's easy to feel threatened and what we sometimes do when we're threatened is we lash out. Guys will say, oh, that guy is too handsome, he looks gay. Sometimes, when we use the S-word, whatever it is, we think that what we're doing is disqualifying that person. You can't date them because of this. What we're really doing is disqualifying ourselves because we're showing how insecure we really are. Much better in the scenario where you start to feel insecure, you're not sure they like someone else A, you could say nothing or B, you can give a genuine compliment to that other person. This shows, one, that you're secure in your sexuality, two, that you think that there's more to you than just your looks, right? You can deal with a bit of competition on that front and the three, everyone isn't an enemy in the world to you. That's how secure you are. You don't need to be best, better, perfect in any way. You can dish out compliments and still have value on your own. It makes you much more attractive and confident. The second thing here is a very different angle. This is the scenario where you're looking at someone and you really like them and you have those rose-colored glasses on. Everything they say is perfect. So they're telling you a story, you know, I went to Jamaica with my family, that's amazing. And then we went to this restaurant, that's amazing, and I had this delicious steak, oh my gosh, that's amazing. When you hear yourself saying, that's amazing, that's so cool, that's so awesome, repeatedly, stop yourself because you are alienating this individual. I certainly encourage enthusiasm. I do it all the time on this channel but not everything in life is truly amazing. And when people hear that you think everything that they do is even when it's not, that's going to make them go, okay, this person likes me a little bit too much, it's needy, and I don't want to continue with them. So much better here is to honestly say things are amazing when they truly strike you as amazing and to not do it when they're not. In those situations where there's something this person really is truly amazing and you don't know what to do other than keep repeating it, some playful sarcasm is very powerful. So they're telling you this honest-to-god awesome story, you can go, hold on, wait a second, let me guess. You also volunteer with orphanages on the weekend and probably practice rocket science for fun in your free time. That is a playful way of saying you are really really cool that isn't just repeating you're amazing, it makes them laugh and it decreases the tension. So the third thing here comes when you're finally ready to spend some time with that person in maybe a more romantic setting. So you want to ask them out and you work all this courage up and you say, do you want to go out sometime? And to your surprise, they say, yes, and you go, great, and you're out of there, right? This is terrible. You may have had a scenario in your life where you've met an old friend on the street, you both go, oh my god, so good to see you, we should hang out sometime. Totally, you split, and what happens? Can we go out sometime means let's hang out never, right? So don't leave any sort of plans that you want to make on can we or should we go out sometime. Much better is to make concrete plans so you can say, instead, hey, Wednesday night, there's this concert, I know you mentioned that you liked it, would you like to go with me? I think it starts around 8 p.m. Now you're getting a yes or a no for a real thing rather than the fake yes or even the completely vague no that you would get from let's go out sometime. So fourth, very similar to this one, I think this is popularized by movies, is can I get your number? This has a lot of problems and the same thing occurs with can I get your Snapchat, can I get your Instagram handle? It treats the trading of contact information as the goal of an interaction when if you're trying to see this person again, the goal is to actually see them again so that's one weird thing but the second thing is imagine that someone's just out of the blue and there's no concrete plans asking for your phone number. Your head is going to go to what does this person want? Are they going to text me all the time? Are they going to call me when I'm at dinner? Like why would I give them my phone number? It can actually make someone who is interested in you way more leery about spending time with you so instead of asking for Instagram, Snapchat, that stuff's a little bit easier because we trade it, or phone number, instead, make concrete plans and once those are made, you're going out, you know, she says yes or he says yes, you're going out at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, say, awesome, what's your number? You're not asking for the number, it's just facilitating that contact between you. And the fifth one has a lot of different flavors but it starts with, you would look better, prettier, more handsome if you cut your hair, worked out, changed your shirt, and one that I feel like is very popular, unfortunately, for men to say to women is if you smiled. So I think this comes from not knowing what to say, they see someone who doesn't look like they're having fun at a party and they want to give a compliment, they say you'd look prettier if you smiled, that person will never smile at you. You just made them so self-conscious about the fact that they are not smiling, you put yourself on opposing teams, they're not going to warm to you so cut that one out of your vocabulary. All the other ones, you'd look better if, I mean you can imagine this, I don't know why we do it other than just nerves, but we're telling someone they will look better if we're saying today is not so good, right? That's going to make them associate bad feelings to you. So unless it's a very particular scenario where they're asking what should I do with my hair and you could say, oh, I'd like it better in this scenario, don't do this, just leave it out. So those are five things that I hear all too often that you should cut out of your flirting vocabulary. Now I actually have two announcements for the end of this video, very exciting ones. The first is that we will be having two videos this week. The next one is coming out on Thursday. It's a bit of a departure from our normal style of video. It is a cringe compilation reaction slash analysis and so it's a new style of video, I'm testing it out. Please check it out, let me know what you think because we're going to be trying to expand into a number of different things and I want to know what you guys like. The second announcement is that I have to thank for that video our sponsor, Simple Habit. They, in part, make it possible for us to experiment like this. Simple Habit, if you haven't yet checked it out, is an app that has guided meditations. Now I've used this in the past for meditations on joy, for feeling more gratitude, but what I would recommend it for if you're interested in this topic is confidence because I've actually gone on and recorded my own meditation for boosting confidence and you can listen to it before you go out in a dating, a social, some sort of career scenario to really put yourself in a confident state. So if you want to check that out completely for free, you can go to the link below simplehabit.com slash confidence to get your one-week free trial. And if you like it beyond that, you can just pay $11.99 a month to continue it. I know that I certainly have and I, at the very least, recommend checking this one-week trial out for those of you who are interested. I have two meditations that I've recorded — that first one is on confidence and I also have another one on self-love and self-acceptance. So I hope that you guys enjoyed this video. I look very much forward to seeing you in the next one on Thursday. Let me know what you think of it then. Take care.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 447}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Bobby Axelrod from Billions has more money and power than most of us can imagine and it's not just because he's a good investor. Bobby is a brilliant negotiator capable of getting people to give him almost anything he wants. Buy them all. Every single last one of them. That'll be expensive. Well, then it's a good thing I'm a rich man. So in this video, we're going to cover five tactics Bobby uses in almost every negotiation and how you can use them to negotiate better whether it's at work, in your romantic relationships, or with friends. The first secret to Bobby's success is he nails down what people need before he negotiates with them. For example, watch how Axe negotiates after initially agreeing to pay this family $25 million for their building. Which is why I am presenting you with a check. $25 million minus $16, which leaves you with $9 million. This is bullshit. We will walk out of here if you don't honor the full amount. No, you won't. How is Axe so confident that he can chop almost two-thirds of his initial offer and still get what he wants? After reviewing your holdings, your business interests, your debts, I know that this check is the only thing standing between your family and bankruptcy. Axe sets himself up for success by doing his research and when he can't find out on his own what someone needs, he'll just ask like here. What do you want? I want back in. It's a simple thing to do but most people don't do it. Instead, most people assume that the person we're negotiating with wants what we would want in their shoes. This is a major mistake and one Bobby's rival Chuck makes often. Watch Chuck try to blackmail one of Bobby's employees by threatening to reveal that he's cheating on his wife. Getting the photo stream in her inbox, all those happy pictures of you and Carson and Anna, well, I might just break her. Unfortunately for Chuck, he starts negotiating before fully understanding what Bill values and it blows up in his face. I knew you'd come with that. I wrote a letter to my wife. The whole story. I just sent it. So in your own life, rather than guessing what the other person wants, take the time to find out for sure. For example, let's say you want more money. Instead of just guessing what your employer wants and silently working at those assumptions, set up a meeting with your boss to let him or her know you're interested in earning a raise. Then ask them, what is a reasonable time frame to earn a raise and what would I have to do to earn it? You can even start by asking, what is a reasonable time frame to get a raise? And then ask, what would I have to do to earn a raise faster than that? Now you have clear targets to hit and when you hit them, you'll be in great shape to negotiate for more money. Once Axe knows what the other person wants from a negotiation, he'll use his body language to manipulate your emotions. If Axe wants to capture the attention of a room and convey that he's the one with the power, he'll stand while others sit. This literally forces people to look up to him. But there's one number that really matters to me. 16. You've been brought back to life. As promised. But it's not free. He does this because we tend to respect and fear people who tower over us. It's no coincidence that Fortune 500 CEOs are on average two and a half inches taller than the average man. So if you're going to give a presentation to people who outrank you, stand. When people physically look up to you, they will subconsciously feel your position is stronger and take you more seriously. This does not mean to stand all the time. In fact, if Axe is certain that he'll have everyone's attention without needing a height advantage, he will set himself up to be splayed out sitting while others are forced to stand. This splayed out sitting position makes you think he's confident and that he feels unthreatened. Going forward, you might want to consider vetting your information a little better. Splaying out over the couch works for Bobby because he has a captive and desperate audience, so he can sit there comfortably and make them come to him to hear his pitch. Positioning yourself like this at a networking event or party wouldn't be nearly as effective because without a captive audience, the person sitting while others stand is likely to be ignored. Now, while both of these strategies have their place, they're inherently a bit adversarial. So Axe has a third position he uses when he wants to make someone feel like they're on the same team working towards the same goal together. And this is the one you'll want to use most often. He sets them up at eye level and side by side with him, like here with Wendy. I drew a boundary and you respected it. Are you ready to trust me again? It's a start. This is called same side, same team, and it's the best way to handle a one-on-one negotiation. So if you notice someone is looming over you and you start to feel uncomfortable, invite them to sit next to you or stand to be at their level. And especially with team members or even on dates, position yourself to be sitting next to each other or on adjacent sides of the table. Once Axe has done his research and set the tone of the negotiation with his body language, it's time to strike a deal. Axe tries to get the most he possibly can from people by using exploding offers to create panic in the other person. Axe loves these now or never traps. Offer 63 million cash. Take it or leave it on the call. No negotiation. I'm counting to five and then it's off the table. One. We'll do it. If Axe gave people time to consider his proposals, they might be able to go out and find better options. Instead, he limits your focus to just two choices — get what you want or miss out and regret it forever. When I walk out that door today, we are friends for life or you don't exist to me ever again. This style of negotiation is incredibly effective. You see it often from companies giving job offers that explode after 24 hours so you don't have a chance to find another job or even in romantic relationships when someone says they'll stop seeing you unless they get a commitment that they want. But this tactic comes with a cost. The other person may end up resenting you for placing time pressure on them. As tempting as it is, you should avoid using this tactic. You'll get yeses from people who wouldn't have agreed if they weren't under time pressure and those aren't the business agreements or relationships you want in your life. And you may scare off good people because they don't like your aggressive style. On the flip side, Axe never allows someone to time pressure him into a deal. No matter how bad his situation seems, he's always willing to walk away from the table, especially when someone tries to change the terms at the last minute because they think they have leverage on him. Watch what happens when an investor tries to sneak something in at the last minute. I need total transparency. And you're going to give it to me because you got nothing else? I can't do it. I won't do it. Go. I pass. Axe is willing to kill the only offer he has and bet on himself to find a better option. Here's another example where Chuck tries to change the terms on Axe's settlement. Put the money in the trust, fine, but you never trade securities again. Not for institutions, not for individual investors, not even for yourself. In both instances, the other person thinks they have Axe in a bad spot and they try to add a last-minute term after having already agreed to a deal. This is a huge red flag and one that should trigger you to immediately walk away from a negotiation. If the new deal ends up being the best you can do, you can almost always come back to the table again after you've had time to assess things. Now in your own life, it can be extremely tough to do what Axe does and walk away with nothing. So whenever possible, try to line up multiple options before you enter a negotiation. That said, one huge mindset that will help you a lot in business and in your personal life is realizing there are infinite options available to you at all times. So if you ever feel stuck taking an offer you aren't truly excited about, remember that just because you haven't seen the better offer doesn't mean it's not right around the corner. One year from now is much more likely that you regret agreeing to a bad deal than that you regret saying no to a deal. The last thing Bobby brings to every negotiation is this mindset. Bobby wants to win and he wants to win by giving as little as possible. Like when he cut his offer from $25 million to $9 million, or this funny example negotiating employee compensation. I should not throw out the first number because I have a tendency to undervalue myself. I'd like to make you a PM. Portfolio manager? I would have gone Prime Minister but there you go, undervaluing. And the money? Meet the new salary. Same as the old salary. I'm a PM. It's worth noting that in the long run, this tactic actually hurts Axe more than it helps him. It may maximize what you get in the short term but life is long and you run the risk of offending the other person like he does here with Taylor. $15 million. You weren't going to start with a performance review or? Hell of a year. $15. I was thinking $50. I'm thinking that the final number will be something just shy of half of what you're looking for. I don't agree. This isn't heavy betting on the Oberlin campus. We don't both have to agree. I say what it is you take it. Taylor just ran Axe Capital for a year and made Axe $700 million. Given that, would it really matter if he gave them $50 instead of $25? Axe's mistake here is thinking of this as a one-time game. Yes, for this one day he makes himself an extra $25 million by disappointing them, but he also sets himself up to eventually be betrayed by his most important employee. Unfortunately, this is how many people think about negotiations. They try to get the best possible terms for themselves on any particular deal without considering if it will make the person want to work with them again. Instead, think of any negotiation as an iterative game. There will be future rounds. So if you can get yourself more in the long run by giving someone more in the short run, do it. If you want to learn more about negotiation, I highly recommend Chris Voss's Never Split the Difference.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"You probably saw GameStop's stock go wild recently, but you may not have realized that the psychology behind its explosion is fascinating. That's why in this video, we're breaking down the seven biggest psychological lessons that will help you understand group dynamics and make wiser financial decisions than 99% of the population. But first, here's a brief recap of the rise of GameStop. Plenty of channels have gone deep on this, so we'll just do a quick overview and then get into the mental aspect. Some Wall Street hedge funds viewed GameStop as a dying business and made big bets that its stock would go down. Some people on Reddit forum called WallStreetBets realized that if the stock went up instead, the hedge funds who bet against it would be forced to buy the stock as part of their bet. This would cause a bidding war between the hedge funds, driving the price up an insane amount. They put their plan into action and between a combination of regular people buying in mass plus the hedge funds being forced to buy, GameStop skyrocketed. Now, most of the time, WallStreetBets is just a bunch of individuals trying to make themselves money. So how were strangers on the internet able to band together to pull this off? The first thing unique to GameStop's situation was the existence of a common enemy. This is obvious in politics and seems used almost daily these days. A common enemy lets you unite people in an us-versus-them mentality. But this is a rare to experience event in the stock market. The hedge funds that shorted GameStop created a unique opportunity to know exactly who you were betting against. This was strengthened further by the villain trope. Simply put, you'll rally together harder against a common enemy if you perceive them not just as other, but as powerful, evil, and unfairly using power to disadvantage you. In that sense, the public perception of hedge funds makes them a near-perfect common enemy to unite people. That's why you saw comments like, I'm buying GameStop, I don't care if I lose it all, and I will continue to invest in companies being shorted by hedge funds until they are all bankrupt. In a bit of irony, people were buying a stock just to participate in an anti-Wall Street movement. The unity and appeal of the group was strengthened even further by the use of heroic language and mythology. This may seem hard to believe, but seeing yourself portrayed in memes of Spartans from 300 or The Scottish from Braveheart incepts your reptile brain a bit, even if you know in your front brain it's just a joke. So now, buying the stock doesn't just give you the chance to make money, you get to feel like part of this group of brave men and women charging into certain death with the chance for glory. This is why it's important to be cautious when someone tries to give you an us-versus-them mentality, especially if they dehumanize or villainize the enemy as uniquely different and morally inferior. It's an extremely common tactic, and if you see it, you're likely being manipulated by someone who wants you to do something. As we'll see later, this can lead you to make decisions that are quite bad for you. Beyond the people who got in early and held, there was another group of people actually buying in at $300 and $400 a share. On the surface, this seems crazy. Why would you buy a stock you know almost nothing about after it's already gone up 100x in a year? In addition to the reasons we already discussed, one obvious reason is recency bias. The fact it had been skyrocketing every day makes you think it'll keep going. But the bigger reason people were buying at the top was scarcity, the fear of not buying and regretting missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's counterintuitive, but in both cases, the fact that GameStop had already skyrocketed was exactly why people were rushing to buy it. As a side note, scarcity is probably the single most powerful trigger to get a person to buy something and salespeople know it. If someone ever tries to sell you on something by saying it'll be gone if you take too much time to think, that's a huge red flag to be wary. So with all this powerful psychology pushing people to buy, why did the stock fall back to earth? First, something extremely unexpected happened. On Thursday, January 28th, the stock jumped from $350 to $480 in the first hour of trading. It looked like it was heading to the moon. Then people found that some brokerage firms had prevented them from the ability to buy GameStop, but not the ability to sell. So the stock fell massively, then made a second push up, and then fell 70%, losing massive amounts of money for anyone who held, sometimes far more than they could afford. So what happened? Where did the momentum go, and why wasn't the line holding? One reason is that GameStop shareholders found themselves in a modified prisoner's dilemma. Here's the situation. If every shareholder holds, even if no one can buy, the price can't drop. Then the hedge funds who short it are forced to buy and shareholders make big money. The problem is, if a shareholder doesn't trust that everyone else will hold, then to maximize their own money, they should sell before everyone else does. And if everyone thinks that way, the price plummets. So what do you do when you're in a prisoner's dilemma with a bunch of people you don't know? The biggest problem for the many people trying to hold the line is that the community of GameStop owners lacks two key components of an actual community, transparency and accountability. If you were on WallStreetBets when the stock was spiking, you'd have seen posts about holding forever with 100,000 upvotes. But what you weren't seeing was the people quietly selling. This is a very common mistake people make. Don't assume silence means compliance. This lack of transparency also meant that no one really knew if the falling price was being caused by hedge fund shenanigans or regular people and institutions selling. Beyond transparency, even if it does become public you sold GameStop, you don't actually get exiled from your community. It's not necessarily a good thing, but it is a fact some of the most strongly united communities have life-altering penalties if you try to leave or disobey the majority. With the community of GameStop owners, people can publicly state that they're in it forever and then flip whenever they feel like it with no penalty. An interesting example of this was Dave Portnoy. One day he was tweeting about having diamond hands aka never selling. The next he retweeted to hold and 24 hours later he sold everything and at least Dave had skin in the game. Many celebrities being praised for supporting GameStop investors didn't actually put money into GameStop. That's another valuable lesson from this whole thing. Look at people's actions, not their words. Elon Musk tweeted GameStonk, but did he invest a meaningful amount? Mark Cuban did an AMA for WallStreetBets where he advised people that if the reason you like the stock hasn't changed, then hold. But if he hasn't bought the stock, what he's saying is that he personally doesn't like the investment enough to buy in. Neither of them did anything wrong. The mistake was investors saw those tweets and those AMAs and thought that Elon and Mark were with them. If either of them suddenly buy a ton of GameStop stock, that is the moment you'll know that they think it's a good investment. In general, if anyone tells you they have a great opportunity for you and they aren't doing it themselves, be wary. One area this is rampant today is with online business gurus who try to sell you advice on how to get wealthy in ways that they themselves have never done. So where do we go from here? No one knows what GameStop will do. It could skyrocket again or keep falling. And the more investment return you chase, the more risk you have to take on. Ultimately, maybe we're all better off trying to make money by doing something that isn't a zero-sum game and actually makes people's lives better. Also, if you're one of those people who looks at hedge fund billionaires and wishes that they would do more to help the people with less, you have a chance to show them how it's done. Every day, 1400 children die from diseases caused by unsafe water. Compared to them, we are all the 1%. But it doesn't take much for you to make a difference. We're running a charity water fundraiser and every $40 gets someone clean water for 10 years. Plus, for the first $100,000 donated, Charlie and I are going to match your donation. So you can donate $20, we'll match you, and together, that gets someone clean water for 10 years who otherwise wouldn't have access to it. 100% of the money donated will be used to build clean water projects. And, when they're complete, Charity Water will send you photos so you can see the exact community you helped.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Amazon's The Boys is full of personalities that are fun to watch but would be terrible to encounter in real life. I'm the Homelander and I can do whatever the f**k I want. Superpowers aside, we've all encountered this type — tough guy bullies who try to push you around, make you feel uncomfortable, or get you to agree to something that you don't really want. So that's why in this video, we're going to cover five psychological tricks bullies use to control you and what you can do instead to avoid them and stop those bullies in their tracks. Now, since we're mainly using Billy Butcher and Homelander as examples of these tough guys, there are going to be some light spoilers through season one of The Boys, you've been warned. First off, one thing that you might encounter from a bully is mismatching friendly gestures with domineering physicality. So on the surface, they may be greeting you with a friendly handshake but really, they're crushing your hand in a death vice. The same thing can occur when they get uncomfortably close to make a point or touch you in a way that is fake friendly as Homelander often does. And I trust we never have to have this conversation again. Now, Homelander and Billy Butcher are clearly imposing individuals but in real life, this kind of touch is usually more ambiguous. Perhaps it's a bully tactic or maybe it's not intended that way. So rather than calling out these types of touches or shrinking away, the best response in real life is to mirror with positive intentions. So someone throws their arm on your shoulder, throw your arm on their shoulder with as much warmth as you can muster. The friendliness that you display makes it hard for someone to continue touching you in an uncomfortable way, especially since you're doing everything that they do back. Now, the second bullying tactic is one that you see in sales situations quite often and it has two elements that often come as a one-two punch. First, someone will put you in a highly emotional state before asking you to make a big decision. Butcher is a huge fan of this when it comes to getting Huey to do what he wants, stoking his anger and his fears. You're laughing. Like she's a joke. Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm laughing. So what are you gonna do about it? Unless you want to explain why you got America's favorite invisible wanker dead on the floor, give us a f***ing hand, will ya? Now in your life, people will play to these same emotions as well as dreams for the future as you've probably seen in a million ads. Now there's nothing wrong with an emotional appeal in and of itself but this enters into manipulative territory when emotional appeals are combined with extreme scarcity like when someone gives you only seconds to make an important decision and Butcher knows the power of this to get people to make rash decisions as you can see here. Listen, I think this is good. I'm good. This is your one and only, mate. Once I go, I'm gone. This technique of using high emotional stakes combined with only a few moments to decide is a favorite of salespeople all over the world and if you fall for it, you will make many purchases that you regret over the course of your life. So the simple rule is this — 24 hours. Said another way, never make a big decision without having a night to sleep on it. If you're at a presentation and there is a table rush scenario with limited copies of a book or a course to buy, do not join in the stampede. If you receive an exploding job offer but they need to know this second if you're going to take it, pass unless they'll wait until tomorrow. And if you're pushed further, you can just say, sorry, I have a policy to never make a big decision without at least a night to sleep on it. And to be crystal clear, any decision that won't matter in a week should still be made as quickly as possible with no second guessing. You want to save that deliberation for those big decisions. Now, the third bully tactic is one of the most common. It's one of Butcher's favorites and it can leave you stammering, locked in your head, wondering how to respond and I'm talking about the insult. I did a whole video on how to handle insults which I think you should check out since they come in all kinds of flavors and varieties, several of which are covered there. But Butcher tends towards unambiguously disrespectful name-calling — that's his favorite. That ain't the invisible s**t. I'll tell you who you are — f**king moron. In the event someone is this directly insulting to you, plan A is normally to remove them from your life. But if you want or need to continue to interact with this person, the most powerful response is actually not to try to one-up them or be clever. And I know you've probably sat in your car and it can feel really good to imagine what you would have said but saying that clever thing just encourages an arms race of ever more clever insults. If you really want to end the insults once and for all, instead, say this — Where I come from, that is really disrespectful. Don't ever call me that again. And then say nothing. If the other person makes excuses, don't address them. If they say that you're overreacting, take it easy. Again, just don't address it. Wait until they apologize then you can forgive them and move on. And by the way, if it's a friend who's doing this and you think that they might have positive intentions, they're just being sarcastic, it's best to do this more softly and privately so that they can save face. Now, fourth — for the fourth bully tactic, I want to move into mindset since there's no exact set of words that's going to be sufficient for every situation. And for this one, I'm talking about people who make demands with personal threats attached. Butcher, for instance, likes to pair these with threats of physical intimidation like here. Look, I didn't want to come here but I need your help and you're gonna f***ing help. In Butcher's case, the threat is often implied to be physical but some demands in the real world are less explicit. For instance, in social circles, common threats are that if you don't comply, you'll be kicked out of the group. In the workplace, it's that you'll lose your job if you don't do what the boss says. I'm also gonna need you to go ahead and come in on Sunday too, okay? And of course, the truth is some of those threats will be real at different points in your life. If you ignore your boss's demands for long enough, you will be out of a job. So if you feel like you're being pushed around either by a physical bully in a friend group or at work and you want it to stop, the only long-term strategy is to find a way to accept the consequences of saying no which means that you might benefit from starting to learn jiu-jitsu now to defend yourself or diversifying your friend group so that you feel less reliant on ones who might be mean to you or, of course, you could develop financial options like a side hustle so that you can risk saying no to a pushy boss. If you do this, the paradox is that you will rarely need to fall back on these options once you have them. Bullies generally sense those people that don't feel comfortable saying no and are hardest on them. They find them to pick on the most. I've seen this to be the case everywhere from the schoolyard to the workplace and there is one subtle variation of this that can make certain demands even harder to resist even if you do have options and it's demands where someone that you care about is threatening you with their own harm or their own sadness. You can see this here in the scene with Starlight's mom who manipulates her emotionally throughout the series. Please, all my friends are going to be watching on TV. It again here with Butcher when he feels like he's out of options. He truly tries every tough guy trick in the book. Did I mention this is life or death? If you have a loved one who consistently makes demands with their own well-being hanging in the balance, recognize that no one is made whole or happy when they outsource emotional control of their life so playing into that pattern doesn't even help them in the long run. Additionally, caring about someone does not mean that you must say yes all the time. So to break out of this pattern, practice saying things like, I love you but I'm not going to do that. You might even add, here's what I can do instead if there is something that you're truly willing and capable of giving. Now this will definitely create discomfort but in the long run, those boundaries are what make for healthy relationships. Now all of these tips work excellently but they are hugely enhanced by having deep authentic confidence and if you want to learn more about developing authentic confidence for yourself so that these tips become more second nature to you, you might be interested in our course, Emotional Mastery. Emotional Mastery is a 24-day program that is designed to help you master your emotions and your subconscious beliefs so that you're consistently feeling better than you might think is possible right now. The goal of the course is to raise the baseline level of joy that you experience on a day-to-day basis which naturally spills over into boosted confidence. The way that it works is by focusing first and foremost on your relationship with yourself. That means exercises that get you in touch with feelings that you may have been repressing for a long time so that you can actually get to the root cause of those times where you're controlled by the fear of rejection or failure or conflict and then put an end to them. Now if you're a fan of the self-esteem or the deeper level confidence topics that I cover on the channel, I would definitely recommend checking out Emotional Mastery because it is the most foundational thing that I have to get those areas of your life locked down.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Whether you call it stress, worry, or just planning, nearly all of us struggle with some form of anxiety, but not Sadhguru. Whichever way you judge me has absolutely no impact on me because I'm completely stoned. So, in this video, we're going to break down how you can overcome anxiety in the instant you feel it. We'll also cover how you can shift your mindset so that it doesn't even come up in the first place. But let's start with the fastest outer fixes and work our way to the more inner profound shifts. You're going to notice that Sadhguru often reveals his palms when he's speaking. In a way, enlightenment means you are an unblemished life, no branding. Lights went off and it just became dark. I just see a mass of people. You just be ready. When he raises his question, you know, this is what he will ask. Ninety-three to ninety-four percent of the time, it's always right like that. We've covered how open palm gesticulation can put your audience at ease in the video on Mark Zuckerberg, who actually doesn't always do this to his own detriment. But when it comes to anxiety, revealing your palms actually helps calm you down in the moment. And that's because anxiety forms a vicious cycle with the uptight body language that it creates. You feel anxious, which makes you clam up, which makes you feel even more anxious. So, opening up sends signals to your nervous system that you're actually safe and it doesn't need to go into panic mode. For maximum effect in the moment, turn open your hands so that you expose the insides of your elbows and tilt your head slightly to reveal more of your throat and uncross your legs. This is a fast and covert way to combat anxiousness in the moment that it arises. Now, this next piece can be added on if you're expected to speak or respond when you're feeling anxious. For instance, if you're called on in class or at work or if you're in a conversation with someone that makes you nervous. And it's to replace any filler words that you might have with pure silence. Watch here. Changes and improvements. Silence can transform the whole situation. Now, this isn't just because filler words like um and uh don't sound nice in conversation. It's because when you're speaking with lots of filler words, you're not actually breathing in and that contributes to that rushed feeling where you have so many words but not enough breath to get it out. Now, this can sound simple but 99% of people rush when they don't know what to say and are feeling anxious, which, of course, makes the anxiety even worse. They sputter ums, uhs, and other meaningless phrases because they fear that too much silence can make them feel inept. Now, this is exactly the opposite of the truth. You have much more time than you think you do to respond to anything. And to demonstrate this, look how long Sadhguru waits before answering a question. We must understand this. But as a general rule of thumb, you usually have at least twice as long as you feel like you do to respond and still have it be a pause that people don't even notice. Now, of course, in normal life, you might not wait quite this long but give yourself extra time when you feel anxiety kick in. And to concretely put this into practice, you can make it your goal for the rest of the day to not use filler words like uh, um, or so in normal conversation. As a natural response to this, you're going to create more silence and more time to breathe in which is exactly what you need to calm your nerves. Moving along to the internal, you can see that Sadhguru often uses reframe phrases. Now, these are phrases that shift your perspective and immediately make anxiety feel smaller and more manageable. Here's an example. You're only working. What will I get? What will I get? What will I get? What the hell will you get? You'll die one day, that's all. There are different kinds of reframe phrases and all of them can be incredibly powerful. Jeff Bezos, for instance, would ask himself what decision would minimize his regrets when he was 80 years old looking back at his life and that's how he decided to quit his job and start Amazon in the first place without worrying about failing. Once I thought about it that way, it was immediately obvious to me. I knew that when I'm 80, I would never regret trying this thing that I was super excited about and failing. Sadhguru often reminds himself and his disciples that in the end, they'll all be topsoil as he puts it and that immediately makes the fear of a big mistake pale in comparison. So, find a question or a phrase that works for you. It can be like Sadhguru and the Stoics reminding yourself that someday you will die or it can be like Jeff Bezos asking how to minimize your regrets or another one that I've always liked is will I care about this at all in 10 years. The answer is almost always no and it makes anxious feelings over a job interview, a date, or seeming catastrophe much easier to just drop. Now, normally, I wouldn't do this but I want to pause here to speak to current events for a moment. I understand that this mindset and the next ones might feel small in comparison to getting fired or not being able to pay your bills or getting sick in this crisis and while I believe that these mindsets can still help anxiety in the most terrible of situations in which you might find yourself right now, I just want to add that I'm rooting for you throughout all of this. I hope that you make it through this crisis stronger and even if things are tough for you right now, I genuinely hope that you find some bright moments for yourself and the people that you love. Anyways, back to the video. This next piece takes us deeper into the long-lasting anxiety-killing mindsets and it's the idea of first accepting then changing. Now, concretely, this means accepting that people around you will be the way that they are and not trying to change them automatically. That means that you'll often be accepting occasionally selfish, rude, unkind, or even cruel behavior. Now, for instance, you can see when Gordon Ramsay visited Sadhguru, at one point, he was invited to a communal pool with meditators. Wow. Wow. When he arrived, he immediately started to break the rules, quote, unquote, messing things up. He splashes around, freestyle swims, and sits on the ball that was meant to be an object of meditation. But listen to Sadhguru's immediate response. Sadhguru laughs and then he calmly corrects Gordon. He even compliments him. Now, you might see this idea of accepting first as being a social doormat. After all, if no one gets upset and yells at the Gordons of the world, how will we get them to stop doing what they're doing? But accepting what is happening with a smile doesn't prevent change from occurring. In fact, it puts you in the best position to make more profound changes going forward. For proof, take a look at what notoriously stubborn, long-term veggie hater Gordon Ramsay had to say after just a few days of eating and spending time with Sadhguru. On the back of the experience here, yes, I'm going to consider it. To put this into practice in your own life, when things start to go wrong, you might want to pause and say to yourself, yes, this is happening. Now, it might sound counterintuitive but you'll find that your anxiety dissipates because you're not fighting what has already occurred and is real and you're going to be more calm and collected for making changes going forward. So, accept first then change. Now, this next mindset is the granddaddy of them all and while you may not entirely adopt this mindset today, moving towards it can dramatically improve the quality of your life and it's to stop depending on the external world to make you happy. Nearly all anxieties boil down to the fear that something won't go your way and, therefore, you will be unhappy. It's the belief that a dream job will make you happy that makes you so anxious for the interview and the belief that a relationship can make you happy that makes you so anxious on that first date. And, of course, this anxiety only makes it harder to nail the dream job or to impress your date. But if you realize that no job or date or external event can make you lastingly happy, the pressure to perform just evaporates. With nothing critical on the line, there's nothing to be anxious about. Now, it might sound insane to say that the external world won't make you happy. To many type A personalities, this sounds like loser talk for people who can't make their dreams come true. But Sadhguru offers us a thought experiment to prove his point. In this case, he gives the example of a luxury car. ...are joyfully driving their BMW. Hello? How many of them are joyfully driving their dream car that they worked for? You will see hardly anybody. But the failure of the external world to offer us what we truly desire goes far beyond cars. Maybe you want to be world famous, to have a great body, to date talented, beautiful people, or to be wealthy. And you work towards those things imagining that you will feel great when you've achieved your dreams. Well, Brad Pitt is one of the most handsome, powerful, successful, famous, talented people on the planet. He's positively impacted millions of people. And he recently revealed that he has been struggling with alcohol as an escape from the pain that he experiences. I mean, certainly, for me, you know, what I realized was I was running to things to avoid, to avoid tough feelings, painful feelings. I just didn't know how to deal with them and looking for... Similarly, Jim Carrey had this to say about all his fame and fortune. I've often said that I wish people could realize all their dreams and wealth and fame so that they could see that it's not where you're going to find your sense of completion. And both of these men deserve to be recognized for sharing their struggles, not least of all, because it lets the rest of us know that happiness is not waiting at the top of whatever mountain we're climbing. It's either there for the climb or not at all. But let's bring this back to anxiety. Imagine a situation where you get anxious. Identify what it was that you were hoping would happen, the thing that you thought would make you happy. Then consider that while you might spike in happiness for a moment if things went your way, in the long term, you actually have nothing to gain from those situations and, therefore, nothing is on the line and you have nothing to be anxious about. Russell Brand describes the internal dialogue he experiences when he feels socially anxious like this. If any of the later mindsets in this video have resonated with you, I definitely recommend checking out our course, Emotional Mastery. It's a five-week video program that's designed to help you master your emotions so that you consistently feel better than you might think is currently possible. And the goal of the course is to raise the baseline level of joy that you feel on a day-to-day basis, to be less easily triggered into anger, stress, or anxiety so that you can enjoy your life and be the best self for everyone around you. It also helps you identify and move towards what you really want for your life instead of blindly following the goals that are laid out by your family or society at large which is where 99% of people probably find themselves. Now, the way this works is by focusing, first and foremost, on your relationship with yourself. This means exercises that get you in touch with feelings that you might have been repressing for a long time. If you're a type A person who thinks that self-love is airy-fairy stuff and feelings are something to be conquered with logic, then this is exactly the course for you. Members often realize that they want to share what they've learned and help other people on their own personal development journey so we've added a bonus section that is a crash course in starting a YouTube channel. Now, this is one that I made at the beginning of the channel where we had about 20,000 subscribers and it's a very, very tactical explanation of how to build a following from zero. Now, I've not spoken about this emotional mastery course on the channel before because we normally only offer to people who have joined our email list or the Charisma University program. And that means that there's no sales page or anything like that explaining the course. It's just the checkout page. So, if you're intrigued and you want to learn more, the best way is probably just to check out the course directly with the link below and you can do that knowing that it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee that is for absolutely any reason at all. There's nothing that you need to do. Just go to the billing section and refund to get every penny back. But I do hope that you try it. So, if you'd like to join, go ahead and click the link below. I hope to see you on the inside. Either way, I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next one.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Few things can ruin your life faster than a toxic relationship. What have you lost as a result of misheard making these allegations against you? Nothing less than everything, no matter the outcome of this trial. I'll carry that for the rest of my day. That's why, in this video, we're going to cover five early signs you or someone you love is in a toxic relationship so that you can change things before it ruins your life. Keep in mind that none of these mean you must break up immediately. Toxicity exists on a spectrum and these are just signs that you need to move things back towards the healthy side or get out. The first sign that things are getting toxic is when someone uses totalizing language in arguments. Listen to Amber Heard do it here. The problem with this language is that it is almost never true. People may mostly be in one way but to say always or never is to reduce the positive things about your partner down to zero while elevating your contribution to the max. It makes the person on the receiving end feel attacked and underappreciated which is likely to make arguments spiral into bad faith personal attacks. So if you or your partner does this, make an agreement to speak about your feelings and what you'd like rather than speaking in absolutes. This means instead of saying, you always make me clean up the dishes, you can say, I clean up the dishes more than I'd like and I would like you to help out more often. When you speak about your feelings and what you'd like, what you're saying can't be argued with and it makes disagreements much more productive. The second sign of toxicity is feeling compelled to gather evidence against your partner to show them how unreasonable they've been. This happened several times in the Depp-Heard relationship with Amber taking secret recordings of Johnny while he was drunk. Maybe in your life, you are tempted to record an argument to show your partner how unfair they're being or perhaps someone makes a list of mistakes that their partners made so they're prepared when they say, well, when have I ever done that? The problem with both of these is that it's a clear indication that one partner cannot trust the other to honestly and clearly reflect on their own behavior which takes us to the third sign which is justifying aggressive behavior by making it a sign of love. For instance, listen to Johnny Depp's words to Amber here. And then you write, the only reason we go for the throat is love. Did I read that right? You did. We saw something similar in Will Smith's acceptance speech after he hit Chris Rock. Love will make you do crazy things. When you say these type of things or allow someone else to say them to you, you guarantee that your relationship is filled with drama, craziness, and potentially violence because if drama, craziness, and violence are proof of love, then that's what relationships are supposed to produce. You are much better off believing that aggressive, cruel, violent behavior is a sign that someone doesn't love you. That way, you don't tolerate that kind of behavior and either change it or get out. Now, sadly, this habit of using love as an excuse to treat people poorly is very common because so many people were raised in homes where parents represented their imperfect behavior as totally loving but we're gonna get more into that towards the end. For now, we're moving to our fourth point which is not believing someone when they show you that you're not compatible. For instance, on the TV show, The Ultimatum, this guy is dead set on having a family and kids while this woman doesn't really want to be a mom. Everyone here, I feel like, for the most part, is like very open to having children. I'm the black she. What is it? It's 75% like the parenting thing. I'm a family man. Simple as that. You think it's something that you could possibly overcome in the future? Maybe, yeah. The problem is this is his takeaway from that conversation. She wants to have kids. I can tell she wants to have kids. I feel like I'm a guy who can comfort those feelings she's having and hold her hand as she goes through. People often believe that accepting a maybe on something that they need in a relationship is an act of love. They think that they can see through to what the other person really needs deep down but there's a lot of ego involved in thinking that you're going to be the one to tame the bad boy or inspire the single girl to want a traditional family. It casts you in the role of savior who can heal others with your special brand of love except that more often than not, maybes don't become yeses and as time goes on, those compatibility issues that you didn't take seriously can become the major source of pain in your life. Here, Will Smith describes how difficult things got when he realized that Jada wasn't going to change her mind about the life she wanted. For context, he thought she'd come around to wanting the life he'd always dreamed of with a traditional partnership guided by traditional measures of success. And I realized she didn't want none of the stuff I had built. The house was too big. She didn't want all of her kids to be getting trolled on Twitter. Like, she didn't want any of that. And there was a decline from there. Yeah, to have to let go of the picture, to have to let go of the dream was devastating. These problems are what caused the Smiths to separate then the whole issue of seeing other people and regardless of how things wind up working out for them, they can both attest that you need to take what someone says they want and don't want in a relationship very seriously at the beginning. Don't view changing someone as an act of love and definitely don't make it your project. Sadly, many of us do the opposite. We pick partners that we are totally incompatible with and try to change them because we haven't worked through our childhood issues and this brings us to our fifth sign and I warn you, most people have this sign so don't take this as an attack. It doesn't mean that you can't have a happy relationship but it does make it harder. And that sign is when you don't know the traumas that formed your childhood experience of love. As an example, let's say that a girl grows up in a household with lots of conflict to the point of violence but when the conflict dies down, perhaps one parent leaves. This could lead to the child assuming that fighting is a necessary part of love because as long as there's fighting, there isn't abandonment. That's how you get lines like this from Amber Heard. And then lines like this when Johnny says he's going to walk away from their argument triggering the childhood terror of abandonment. Or take a boy born into a household with physical abuse. He may think that remaining strong through that abuse is a demonstration of love which he believes is totally appropriate. That's what Johnny Depp answered when asked why he stayed with Amber despite episodes of physical abuse. I'm sure that it's somehow related to my father remaining stoic as my mother would beat him to death. When two people in a relationship haven't healed their childhood trauma around what love means, it can guarantee that things become toxic. Without realizing it, they're very likely to create exactly the scenarios that they say they don't want as they search for the love they're most familiar with from childhood. Now, you may not have big obvious traumas in your childhood but comparatively, little ones can still create dysfunctions down the line. For instance, maybe your parents didn't know how to handle you being angry other than by withdrawing from or punishing you. You might learn that love can't tolerate being angry and, therefore, you repress your frustrations in relationships. This might seem like a great low-conflict strategy but down the line, those unconscious frustrations will find a way to express themselves in your life perhaps as self-critical behavior or sudden bursts of anger. Now, this is just one hypothetical outcome of many but whatever the case, we all have unconscious rules around what love means and we act out those patterns until we consciously heal them. That's why it's a good idea to explore our early life relationship traumas even if we think we don't have any. Our video on Will Smith goes more in-depth on this if you'd like more on the topic. In the meantime, if one of the areas you think you could improve is your confidence, you might like our course, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step video guided program that is guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in 30 days. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below but I think that the strongest way to let you know what it's all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few of the things that our CU members have written in. The first is from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I, hands down, had the best interview out of everybody and they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. Another person wrote about their social life saying, It has been truly incredible. I've instantly had results that seem insane. So many more meaningful connections, my friendships have improved, and my interactions with total strangers are a new, exciting, fulfilling thing. I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system. And this last one is from someone who says that the course has been life-changing and he says, Your course has been life-changing to the point where I wake up in the mornings feeling like I've been transferred to a new person's body — the person I kept dreaming about becoming before I found Charisma on Command. It is incredible. I found myself and I found what makes me happy. And you can see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do so, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all been there before. You're talking to someone you like and you can't quite tell if they're flirting with you or just being friendly. So for today's video, we've brought in body language expert Vanessa Van Edwards to teach you five subtle signs someone secretly likes you. Here she is. Number one, look for the Marilyn. The first body language sign you have to know is the Marilyn. Marilyn Monroe was known for a signature body language move where she tilted her head and exposed her neck. Are you staying at the hotel? Not at all. Kiss me. Women do this deep head tilt while flirting to not only show they're intensely engaged, but also to release pheromones. One particular time you're likely to see this is when she's laughing. Check out this clip of Jennifer Lawrence talking to Chris Pratt. She laughs and tilts her head over to the side, exposing her neck in a classic Marilyn. She's my best friend. We're mortal enemies. No. If you see the Marilyn while a woman is laughing or smiling, it's a great sign of interest. Number two, be ready for a cross into your intimate zone. The second attraction cue you should be on the lookout for is watching to see if a woman crosses into your intimate zone. Research finds there are four different space zones. The public zone, which is when someone stands about seven feet away. The social zone, when people are five feet away. The personal zone, about three feet away. And the intimate zone, about 18 inches away. When someone moves into your intimate zone, they want to literally be closer, both physically and emotionally. We move towards people, topics, and things we like. So always be on the lookout for someone crossing into your intimate zone. This could happen with someone moving their entire body closer by stepping in or scooting their chair closer. Here is Brad and Angelina in the early part of their relationship. Watch Angelina lean back into Pitt's personal space. 20,000. What a wonderful fight. A woman could also reach into your intimate zone with a touch or lean. In the heat of their early romance, Angelina was constantly reaching over to touch Brad Pitt. The couple got particularly cutesy during the 2009 awards season, with Angelina placing her hand on Brad's chest as they shared a laugh. And here is one with Bruno Mars and Miranda Kerr, where she reaches out for a high five. That's good. That was kind of perfect. Number three, toes are the windows to the soul. The third attraction cue to watch out for might surprise you. Most people say eyes are the window to the soul, but actually, the toes are more accurate. When we're interested in something, we want to move towards it. To do this, we have to angle our toes in the direction we want to move. This can even happen across a room. Look at this original tryout video for the movie Step Up, as Jenna Dewan interacts with her future husband, Channing Tatum. Notice how she angles her whole body towards him. I feel like we're taking. Even as they are speaking, she keeps angling her toes and body towards Channing. Don't forget to watch those toes. They can give you a clue to attention. Number four, look for a touch me. The next attraction cue is called a touch me. When a woman wants to be touched, she might subconsciously touch that part of her body herself. She wants to be kissed. She touches her lips. She likes when someone touches her neck. So she touches her neck. A woman might do this without even realizing it. Subconsciously, it also draws someone's attention to those more sensuous areas. Women might also touch their neck or hair to release pheromones and call attention to the health of their hair or skin. This is a subconscious signal of vitality to a potential mate. Look at this example of Nicole Kidman talking to Jimmy Fallon about flirting with him on their first date. She touches her hair and leans in. Notice she's also angling her body and toes towards him. I don't know if you remember this, but we met before. Oh, I remember. Do you remember this? It's really embarrassing for me. Yes. Nicole Kidman does not do this on other interview shows, keeping her toes towards the audience and her hands to herself. Special note, self-touch is not nail-biting. Touching lips and nail-biting are totally different cues. While touching lips can be sensual, nail-biting is likely a sign of nervousness. Number five, look for a savor smile. The fifth cue is called a savor smile. This is a slow smile that blossoms across the face and reaches all the way up into the eyes. When we are truly delighted by someone, we savor smile. The key here is to look for a genuine smile that reaches all the way into the eyes or upper cheek muscles. A fake smile stays on the bottom half of the face. Take a look at this interview with Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake. Jessica Biel has a huge smile as she looks intently at her husband. And then watch in this interview how a smile blossoms across Jessica Biel's face as she leans towards Justin's intimate space. Let's compare this with Jessica Biel's non-savor smile when she's talking to Conan O'Brien. You can see she holds the smile on the bottom half of her face, but it does not reach all the way up into her eyes. Watch for a savor smile to tap into authentic emotion. So now you know some subtle signs that someone is feeling attracted to you. But what if you're realizing that you don't get these signs thrown your way as often as you'd like? One of the fastest ways to make yourself more attractive is to boost your charisma and your confidence. If that's something you're interested in seriously committing to, you should check out Charisma University. It's a step-by-step 30-day video series that comes with daily action guides guaranteed to show you exactly what to do each day to take your charisma and confidence to the next level. And if for whatever reason you don't, then you can get a full refund just by pushing a button inside the course.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Did you know that people usually decide if they respect you within the first minute of meeting you? Sometimes that takes as few as just five seconds, which goes for both good and bad impressions. So you give me seven minutes, I will teach you five psychological tricks that you can use to command respect instantly, and these will-build habits that make that respect last. First is something you can do before you even speak to someone, and that is to fill up your because people subconsciously associate limited availability with higher value. Now, the flip of this is being free whenever you are, and although that flexibility is meant as a kindness, it can actually make people more likely to show up late or flake, and that is true in business, it's true in friendships, and in dating. So the way to build respect here is to purposely fill your calendar with real commitments, even if they're just for you. That can mean blocking out time for the gym, your hobbies, or your favorite TV show. For me, every Sunday evening was sacred for Game of Thrones for a long time. I wish I was the monster you think I am. Which means that when you're scheduling with anyone, you will naturally say things like, I'm free Thursday at noon or Wednesday at 2 p.m., which works for you. When you do that, you find that people actually put more effort into connecting, into showing up to that time than if you kindly but foolishly break your commitments to try to accommodate other people. Now, the second key point is evolutionary, and it has to do with how we move and direct our attention. You see, we unconsciously know that those rapid, jerky movements of prey animals are associated with fear because those animals are doing that to scan the horizon for threats. Now, on the other hand, we sense that those slow, comfortable movements of predator animals that don't need to react to everything are associated with power and safety. Now, humans are both prey and predator, so when we see humans do one or the other, we will unconsciously feel uncomfortable when they're behaving in that prey way and very relaxed when they're in that more predator mode. It doesn't mean that they're dangerous, it just means that they're slow. So there's tons of ways to practice this confident quality of your movements, but one very easy way is to make sure that when you're speaking to someone, that you don't let someone else interrupting you rip your attention away. You don't let every noise capture you. So if you're talking and someone cuts in with a question, don't immediately let that interruption dictate where your attention goes. You let the other person finish or you finish, and then you come back to that person with something like, Hey, good to see you. What were you asking about? And when you do this, both the person that was listening to you and the person who actually interrupted you who wanted your attention are going to respect you more since your attention can't be ripped away by any little thing. Now, this third point has to do, again, with how we direct our attention, but it's for people that go too far in the direction of that second point because, yes, you don't want to let people completely control your attention, but some people will then make the mistake of not acknowledging others at all. So they'll be walking down the sidewalk, see someone else with headphones in, and they won't even look at them. They'll just, you know, down or away. Or they know someone at the gym that they've spoken to once or twice, and that person has dumbbells when they arrive, and they don't know whether they should, you know, wave or make eye contact or greet them, so they just kind of, again, down. Or if you go into a crowded meeting room of a bunch of colleagues, you might feel like, I can't say hi to everybody, so I guess I just wave awkwardly. Now, the principle that actually builds respect here is to extend yourself further than you normally do, and most people do when it comes to acknowledging and greeting others. That means letting friendly eye contact linger on the stranger on the sidewalk even if it's not reciprocated. It means going up to that guy that you met at the gym and giving him a quick clap on the back if he's between sets or just a big wave if you don't want to disrupt him while he's working out. And in a crowded meeting room, it might mean that you shake hands with at least one more person than you normally would even if that means you have to walk around a table and go out of your way to do so. Now, when you do this, obviously, people are going to feel appreciated, but they'll also respect you because you bailed them out of that uncomfortable uncertainty of if they should acknowledge you or not. And it's a simple way to mark yourself as a leader in any situation. Now, the next point is all about filler words. We all know that you shouldn't say, uh, um, or like, and we try not to. But most people don't know is that words like, amazing and that's so cool can crush your respectability in the same way as those other words. And that is because even though it can feel like, hey, I'm just trying to be enthusiastic, those phrases sometimes will make the other person feel that you're overly impressed for no reason and they're likely to try to withdraw from you as they wonder why you're buttering them up. So instead, what you want to do is eliminate inauthentic compliments. Only compliment people when you are genuinely moved to appreciation. When people feel that you're being sincere, something that you noticed about them, they are going to respect it rather than thinking you're just some sort of a nice guy that wants something from them. And if you really, really try to give compliments on every occasion that you feel appreciation, you will wind up giving way more compliments, starting way more conversations than if you just use compliments as some sort of uncomfortable lubricant in conversation. So this pairs very well with the point about greeting people. You put them together. Now, part of the reason that we add those filler words sometimes is because we feel pressure that we need to have something useful to say constantly in conversations. And this next point helps deal with that. It's something that I've actually become infamous for on YouTube. So whether you're giving yourself three or five or ten seconds, the rule is that we give ourselves so much less time than we offer to others when it comes to silence. So we need to recognize that and give ourselves the same amount of space that we would offer to them which means that pure silence is totally fine as you gather your thoughts after someone asks you a question or even if you're mid-story. If you feel like you need some sort of crutch words, try, hmm, let me think about that. I've seen Dr. K do that a ton and it actually makes the other person feel very listened to. So I'm going to toss something out there. Sure. Can I think for a second? And though it might feel sometimes like that clock is ticking, got to say something, actually gathering yourself, taking a moment draws attention to you because it shows that you're reflecting deeply on what that person has said or what you want to say next. If you listen to the greatest stories tellers like Dave Chappelle, just notice how much silence is in their stories. Then I looked over in the corner, there was a box custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched and on the back, they stitched on the K heart on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys and he walked right to my son. He said, hey, little man, I want you to have this. So give yourself that same space, that same grace. Take a moment, slow down in interaction. It will help a ton. And I acknowledge that, yes, implementing everything I just said can be tricky. Which of these are you supposed to do first? How do you make these effortless instead of feeling like a test? So if you're interested in the fastest way that I know of to make this stuff effortless, you might be interested in my course, Charisma University. You get full details at the link here. But basically, if you like the YouTube channel and charisma, confidence, building respect is a priority for you, I highly encourage you to click the link, check it out, learn more, and maybe join.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"If you've been watching this channel for a while, you might have realized that the most interesting and useful psychological tricks that we talk about are not taught in school. The good news is that's where we come in. So in this video, we're going to be covering five psychological tricks that can get you more of what you want from life more easily and these are especially useful in any sort of scenario where you're trying to persuade someone. The first one has to do with a very common word that you use all day long — the word BUT. What people don't realize around the word BUT — I'm not talking about your rear end, I'm talking about the conjunction — is that everything that comes after that in a sentence is where all of the emotional weight goes so people get this wrong. When they have mixed messages, they tend to front load the good stuff up first and then the bad stuff comes second but this is exactly not the way that you want to do it if you want someone to walk away with a positive feeling about you so here's a for example. Let's say that a friend invites you out and you can't make it. What most people do is they say something like, Man, I would love to go. I really appreciate the invite but I can't make it tonight. That's not terrible but all of the emotional emphasis on the fact that you can't make it. If you simply switch that and you say, Ah, I can't make it tonight but I would have loved to have gone and I really appreciate the invite, all of a sudden, the emphasis emotionally is on the fact that you're appreciative that you would have loved to have gone, you're going to get more invitations, that person is going to feel better so any sort of scenario with mixed news, put the good stuff second and the tougher stuff first. This second tip has to do with something called a double bind. Now these are everywhere. The first thing you want to be aware of is when it's being used in a sales situation perhaps to your detriment so if you're going out and you're looking to buy a car, for instance, you're meandering through the lot and this person says, Do you want to buy one that has a leather interior or that has a fabric interior? Maybe you've not set your mind on buying at this place, you might want another brand but they're trying to put you in that line of which of our cars are you going to buy. They don't care if it's fabric or leather. Now this idea is all the time in sales, be aware of it, but you can actually use it much to your own benefit with people who are stubborn or if there's a scenario where you know what you're trying to persuade someone to do is maybe something that they're not immediately going to be open to and the best way to do this is to use a double bind. It goes like this, you say, Look, I know that you're probably going to be skeptical about this and quite frankly, if you weren't, I would think something is wrong with you. When you do that, a very interesting double bind occurs. If the person agrees with you, you're leading the conversation and you're going to explain to them why they're skeptical and why you are skeptical of this thing but why in the final analysis, you came around to having an open mind. In the second scenario, with the most stubborn people, they'll say, What do you mean? I'm not skeptical or at least they'll do this in their own head and they will go into this conversation trying to convince themselves to have an open mind which can be very very useful if you're trying to persuade someone to do something. So that takes us to the third piece — this is around visualization. Now everyone knows that when you visualize, you can do incredible things with yourself. What we don't realize is that the images that are created in other people's heads by our own words are just as powerful and I think the most effective or at least the one that gets commented on the most when I meet fans tip that I have ever given is around interviews and it's when you get to that final section of the interview, you use this tool. They say, Do you have any questions about the company? And you respond, Yes, actually, I do. So let's say this interview went really well and a year from now, we're looking back. What would I have had to have done in that year for you to feel like I was a great employee and then this was a good pick? When they're doing this and they're going through in their mind answering your question, they're listing all the traits you would have had to have, they are visualizing you getting the job and nailing the position so when it comes time to select who's going to get this job, guess who's going to be at the top of their list? They've thought about you doing a great job already. The same principle can be used across the board. If there's ever a time where there's a gatekeeper, right, and you don't feel like you're going to be able to get in, they're saying, we're not going to do this, have you ever made an exception? It immediately forces them to go into their brain and think through imagery of times where they have made an exception. If you're dating or you want someone to like you generally, imagery of you in their mind even if it's something that will never ever happen that is positive bodes very well for your future relationship so you can be a complete joke. If you're going on a first date, you're going on a second date, you might say something like, okay, our first date, you know, at the bar, that was great. Our second one, we're going to take a luxury cruise, we're going all across the Mediterranean, we're going to run around on the beaches and probably fly back in time for Monday, right? It's a joke, you can laugh about it, she can expand or he can expand upon the joke. The point is that now this person has this image in their mind that is very fun, hopefully, and that they are associating with you so any sort of positive imagery that you can create with yourself is going to be very very useful for getting people to like you. The fourth tip has to do with framing. Everyone gets this wrong, it is so simple but there's something that is an iframe and a uframe. Most people speak in iframes and you can generally find it by the fact that they use the word I often. When you're trying to be persuasive, using an iframe is worth nothing. It's all about uframes even if the iframe is polite. So I often get messages that say something like, it would mean the world to me if you could do X, Y, or Z for me, I love your channel, I, I, I. And while that's all kind and it's very polite and sweet, it's not at all persuasive. Much more effective in the times where I do find myself doing things for fans that have reached out are when they talk about you, in this case, it's me, and they say, you know, same person might write an article and say, I wrote this article, it would mean the world to me if you could share with your audience. Somebody else might say, I wrote this article for your audience specifically. There's something in there that is framed around sharing this article to get more eyeballs on your content. No pressure but if you'd like to share it, I think it could help you out a lot. The second one could be the same article is going to be much more persuasive because it's framed in terms of my benefits and I think when we're growing up as kids and even interacting with teachers, we expect people to just want to do things for us and then when we get out into the world and strangers aren't as obliging as parents or teachers may have been, it comes as a shock to some people. So get used to that uframe rather than the iframe. The last thing here has to do with scarcity. Now I've talked about scarcity but truly, it might be one of the most, if not the most, important psychological factors for creating desire. We go crazy when we feel like this is our last chance to have something, someone, whatever it is. The problem here is that when we really want something in our lives, we tend to make ourselves extremely available. We destroy any sense of scarcity. Now I'm not telling you to fake scarcity or fake plans or pretend that you're not available to the people in your life that are interested in spending time with you but I am saying that when you're dating, for instance, and your friends ask you if you can go out Friday night on a Wednesday but you're trying to keep that weekend open for that person who might ask you, say yes to your friends and commit to it. I promise you if that person contacts you on Thursday and says, are you free Friday? You say, ah, I can't actually because my friends are out but I appreciate the invite and would have loved to, right? We're using two here. The next week, they're going to contact you on Tuesday or Wednesday because that makes them value your time more. When you're looking for jobs, don't just go all in on one job and explain to them how this is your everything, right? It might be very important for you to get that job and you can say that but continue searching elsewhere. Quite frankly, this just happened within our company. We're looking to potentially hire someone, they're in sort of a trial phase, and they got to a position where they said, look, there's this other gig coming up, I do want your job, I would really like to have it but I need to know by next Thursday or else I have to take this job. This put pressure on us and quite frankly, we decided to go with the person. Would we have otherwise? I don't know. The point is scarcity is incredibly important for influencing people. It works on me, it works on everybody all the time. Don't fake it but allow your schedule to be filled with things that make you a bit more scarce and less 100% available. So I hope that you found this helpful. You can start applying these tips today. What's up, guys? This is Charlie from the future realizing that I forgot to make two quick announcements. The first one is that we now have a podcast. If you'd like to check that out, there's a link in the description where you can watch it on YouTube. It will soon be on iTunes, Stitcher, all that stuff but for now, the link is in the description if you want to see the most recent episode. The second announcement is that we are actually hiring at Charisma on Command. I'm looking for specifically a research assistant, potentially a writer to help me with charisma breakdowns. A lot of my work goes into this and having someone to support me with that would be massively helpful to creating more content for all of you, guys. So if you think this is something you'd be good at, go ahead. The link to the job application is in the description.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Shark Tank has had roughly a thousand pitches air so far, and one stands out as possibly the worst ever. This pitch goes so badly that after it aired, Maneesh even started to get death threats. Now, this video isn't a critique of Maneesh, we don't know anything about his personality based on a TV show, but there's a lot we can learn from this pitch. Specifically, we'll go over five common mistakes that instantly make people like you less. We'll also review what you can do instead to make better impressions in business meetings, job interviews, and even when meeting new friends or going on dates. Let's start by looking at the first 10 seconds. That's where Maneesh sets the tone for this interaction. His first mistake is looking down when he walks into the room. When he does look up to make eye contact, he doesn't smile, and he speaks with a flat voice. This may seem like nitpicking, but studies show that first impressions form in the first seven seconds of an interaction, which means an interviewer, potential client, or date are all deciding if they like you before they actually know much about you. Those first seven seconds are an easy chance to give yourself an edge. For a quick comparison, watch another entrepreneur from the same episode. Aaron makes eye contact and speaks through a smile, and you can see Mark and Barbara smiling back just from mirroring his energy. Now, when Maneesh gets into his product idea, the Sharks start to get interested, but his demeanor hurts him again, watch. Maneesh gets defensive at their laughter, but he didn't have to. When someone laughs at something you say or do, you get to choose if they're laughing with you or at you. His mistake was reacting like they were laughing at him. Rather than scolding the people he's trying to raise money from, Maneesh could have smiled, laughed along, and said something like, I know it seems ridiculous, but wait till you see our testimonials. The room would be feeling good, and he could transition right back to his presentation. So far, things haven't gone great, but it's not awful. These next two clips are where Maneesh starts to permanently lose people. The experiments and trials Maneesh is referring to are not specific to Pavlok, and you can see on Mark's face that he thinks Maneesh is stretching the truth. You see something similar a minute later. This is a very common mistake made in the business world and even the dating world. You think admitting your weaknesses makes you look bad, but it's actually trying to hide your weaknesses that makes people dislike you. People can partner with you knowing you're imperfect, but if they think you're lying to sell yourself, they never will. The other, less obvious mistake Maneesh makes is not answering the question behind the question. Mark's real question is, before I invest in this, how do I know it actually works? Look what Maneesh had in his back pocket but never said. Imagine if Maneesh had said, I don't know the exact percent of time it doesn't work, but we have a 4.5 star rating from our customers and the reason Damon isn't here is because he's a customer and he credits Pavlok with getting over two bad habits. He would have gotten a very different reaction. This happens all the time in all of our lives. When an interviewer says, tell me about your last job, there's a question behind the question. They don't just want to hear about your last job, they want to hear why your last job prepared you to do this one well. When a first date asks you where you're from or what you do or why you're single, what they're really trying to figure out is if they're attracted to your personality and if the two of you are a good match. Answer the question behind the question and things will go much better for you. Now let's look at when things go really badly for Maneesh. If you use it on sugar, after about three or four days on like a cookie or tortilla chips, you'll start to notice the flavor changes. Now what's interesting about it in the first... You start to notice the flavor changes. Yeah, you do. You can see his frustration is starting to leak out. You can't be that stupid, Robert, to even think there's any legitimacy. Can I just listen? Calm down. Calm down. Gosh, you guys are making me so ADD. All right, let me talk about the... We make you ADD. You guys make it happen. All right, Maneesh, you're a strange dude. At this point, despite the tough questions, no one has dropped out. But they start to, specifically citing his presentation and not his product as the reason why. I find your presentation is exhausting and complicated and I couldn't imagine having the energy to deal with that. This doesn't sound very positive, Barbara. I'm out. Mark Cuban lays it out well here. If you would have just said, you know what, this is a reminder and everybody is different so we have different ways to remind you, right? But you went so over the top with nonsense, it is everything but a legitimate product. And for those reasons, I'm out. Despite all this, Maneesh still gets an offer from Kevin. He says Maneesh is hard to listen to, but that he likes the product idea. It's Maneesh's response to that offer that gets him thrown out of the room. It's an offer. It's an offer. This is the problem. Mr. Wonderful, I just, I can't work with you. Not a great start and it only gets worse from here. Maneesh went into the meeting knowing he would never accept an offer from Kevin. He should have planned what he was going to say if this happened. Instead, we get this. Why don't you want the structure of that offer? Why not? The structure is actually quite good. It's the person. I would take an offer from anybody besides Mr. Wonderful. And not surprisingly, that doesn't go over well with any of the Sharks. Maneesh, you're an a**hole. Get the f**k out of here. Oh! Are you all out? F**k you. We're all out. Done, Maneesh. Thank you for coming. Won't want to be you. Kevin's anger isn't because Maneesh turned down an offer. That happens all the time on the show. It's because this feels like an attack on his character. Maneesh is being critical of Kevin as a person instead of pointing to a specific past behavior. So how should Maneesh have handled this? First, let's watch him explain the real reason he said no. Why did you turn down the offer? The reason why is because Mr. Wonderful is on TV saying that 3.5 billion people living in poverty, living on a dollar a day is a good thing. He's like, it makes them strive to work harder. And I'm like, I don't want someone like that working in my company. Imagine if after getting his offer, Maneesh had said, Mr. Wonderful, I think you're a fantastic investor, but I heard you give a speech on poverty that makes me think we aren't a good fit. It's more accurate to how Maneesh feels and doesn't make him look bad to the other sharks or the viewers. The key to having any hard conversation like this is to separate the person from the specific behavior you don't like. So in your own life, don't call someone a bad roommate or a bad friend. Instead, call it their specific behavior and how it makes you feel. Now, a fair criticism here is, yeah, but you've had time to think about this. Maneesh was scrambling to come up with something on the spot in a high pressure situation. It's not fair to expect him to have the perfect answer. And you're right. So if you know an important conversation is coming, sit down beforehand and think through the tough questions and situations you might find yourself in. Give yourself infinite time and calm nerves so you don't have to rely on being quick on your feet. If this all seems like a lot to take in and you want a more linear step-by-step guide to mastering these skills, you may like our program, Charisma University. It's a 30-day program guaranteed to make you more confident and charismatic.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"There are sociopaths in this world who will embarrass, manipulate, and even physically hurt you to get what they want. And because their brains don't work like most people's, it can be tough to see it coming until it's too late. So in this video, we're going to help you better understand the mind of a sociopath. Then, we'll go over five subtle signs to help you tell if someone is a sociopath. While no single trait means anything definitive, if you see these all together, it can be a red flag. When it comes to the mainstream media, the most heavily emphasized trait of sociopaths is in their lack of empathy. Simply put, they do not relate to other people's pain or sadness. While it's often used for laughs on TV, you may not realize that this lack of empathy has a scary consequence. Sociopaths have a strong internal urge to manipulate you. To understand why, here's a thought exercise. Think about your own life and something you want. Maybe it's a promotion at work or something someone else owns or even wanting to have sex with someone. Now imagine what you would do to get that thing if your brain could not feel guilt. If you didn't care about hurting other people to get what you want. Listen to these two diagnosed sociopaths talk about that instinct to manipulate. Not every sociopath is a bad person, but that instinct to manipulate is why it can be important to know if you're talking to a sociopath. Sociopaths today are even considered to be on the same spectrum as psychopaths and it's not as uncommon as you may think. According to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, one in 30 people are said to have these antisocial personality disorders. So if your school or your place of work has more than 30 people in it, you may be interacting with a sociopath or psychopath without even realizing it. The first potential sign that you've met a sociopath is a strange one because meeting a sociopath doesn't come with some gut sense of dread. Often, it's the opposite. Their first impressions can feel too good to be true. This is because they have no boundaries as to how much they will fake about themselves to win you over. Listen to this man describe how he would get close to people in order to use them. I'll speak to someone. I won't really tell them much about me. They'll tell me about them and then once they tell me about them, I'll kind of form a personality. I'll exaggerate certain features about my own personality to match what it is that they're looking to see. Now, a lot of people do this to a smaller degree when meeting new people. They'll pretend to be more interested in the things they say or laugh at jokes that aren't particularly funny. But sociopaths and psychopaths take this to a level far beyond where most neurotypical people would be comfortable. Here's a more vile example from a serial pedophile with ASPD. He's talking about how he would earn people's trust so that he could take advantage of them. The best way to fool people is to help them. It's to ask what they want, ask what they need. Do they need any help doing anything? Do they need any money or do they need their car fixed? Do they need the grass cut? Do they need their children looked out for? So if you walk away from a first encounter feeling completely enamored with a person, you may have just experienced the fake charm of a sociopath. Of course, not everyone you feel an immediate special connection with is a sociopath. Some people just have likable charismatic habits and make good first impressions. So don't let that on its own be a red flag. If you have this feels-too-good-to-be-true experience and you aren't sure what it means, then keep an eye out for the next sociopath clue, the sociopath stare. Since sociopaths feel shallow emotions at best, they don't get nervous around people. This means they don't feel compelled to break eye contact like most people do. Listen to Kanika explain it here. I don't break eye contact very often. I had to physically teach myself to blink more often, which is really weird. Yeah, and to stop staring at people. It freaks them out. Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was infamous for going 10 seconds between blinks. Every time you create something new, there should be questions. And to me, that's a sign that you've actually done something that is transformative. In general, strong eye contact is a sign of confidence. But if someone is engaging in 10-second bouts of unblinking eye contact with you, take note. It could be a red flag. Now, let's say this person isn't a stranger, but someone you already know well. A classmate, a work colleague, or even a friend. If you've managed to get into a relationship with a possible sociopath, you may want to ask yourself this question. Do I do more favors for them than I do for most people? Because of their instinct for manipulating people, sociopaths can end up getting more favors from you than anyone else. They'll do this by starting small before working their way up to bigger asks. They'll also lie to you and use your own empathy against you. I would tell her, oh, you know, my dog, he got rushed to the hospital last night. We were there late until about 3 a.m. And there was this problem and that problem and that problem. And I don't even have a dog. You might think you would know if someone was lying to you. But sociopath lies often go unnoticed for two reasons. First, sociopaths are extremely comfortable lying. They don't have the normal tells like fidgeting, a hard swallow, or trouble holding eye contact while lying. Second, unlike the small white lies most people are comfortable telling, sociopath lies are way more detailed and grandiose and sociopaths are much more comfortable doubling down on a lie when caught. So much so, it's hard for a neurotypical person to detect the lie because you end up thinking this can't possibly be a lie because no normal person would lie this way. Jodi Arias is a good example of this. Watch the various stories she spun up after her ex-boyfriend was found murdered at his home. Were you at Travis's house on Wednesday? Absolutely not. I was nowhere near Mesa. I was nowhere near Phoenix. I witnessed Travis being attacked by two other individuals. Who? I don't know who they were. I couldn't pick them out in a police lineup. So what happened? I'm not proud that I just left my friend there to be slaughtered at the hands of two other people. I'm not proud of that at all. I didn't mean to shoot him or anything. This is an extreme example but it goes to show how someone with ASPD is much more comfortable following up a lie with another lie and feeling no shame or guilt about doubling down on their lie or creating an elaborate fake story. Diane Downs, who murdered her own daughter, even tried to use the elaborate nature of her lie to prove she wasn't lying. I wouldn't walk in there and say, this weird person came up out of nowhere and shot us for no reason and just left. I mean, that's not a believable story. I could have, if I had done this, I could have come up with a believable story. Now it's worth repeating, most sociopaths aren't murderers. Many people with ASPD don't even know they have it and they live mostly normal lives. But you can see why it would be so hard to spot a sociopath was lying if they were someone close to you. Finally, the last sign that you're dealing with a sociopath is that their emotional responses seem off. For instance, because sociopaths don't have a natural empathy, any condolences they share will be learned and potentially robotic. What I'll have to do is I'll have to logically understand that, okay, this is an event that people typically get sad at. So I would have to find words of confidence to give them. You know, I'm sorry that happened to you. I know that must be hard. Is there anything I could do? Would you like to talk? Sometimes it's those moments where a sociopath tries to fake empathy that they will accidentally reveal their lack of it. This is actually one of the areas that the show Dexter does a good job of highlighting. The writers make sure he occasionally mishandles reacting to bad news. I'm having intermediations with La Guelta. Congratulations. Paul's dead. Oh? Another emotional response to look out for is a lack of guilt after hurting you. Did you always understand the negative effect manipulation can have on others? No, I didn't. I didn't always understand why people had an adverse reaction to it because in a way I kind of looked at it like a game and you lost. One particular phrase to look out for is, why are you so upset? As a one-off, it doesn't mean anything. But if this is something you hear repeatedly, it may be a clue that the person you're with struggles with empathy. If you're dating a sociopath, this question can also be a lead-in to more dangerous behaviors like invalidating your feelings and gaslighting you. Because a sociopath lacks empathy, they are going to have a very strong frame when they say things like, it's not a big deal, I don't know why you're so upset, you're overreacting. This is why it's important to maintain strong relationships outside of your significant other so you have people you trust that can reorient you because it is very hard to be in a one-on-one frame game with a sociopath. There is one thing most people misunderstand about sociopaths and their emotions. While a sociopath's expressions of empathy or sadness will be muted, their anger response is actually heightened. This is one of the biggest differences between a sociopath and a psychopath. Psychopaths tend to be more universally detached. They have all their emotions under control. But sociopaths are often impulsive and actually quick to anger. And when they do get angry, the level of anger they feel and express often seems extreme. So a sociopath is likely to lash out in anger. This may relate to the different causes of sociopathy and psychopathy. The current belief is that psychopaths are born. It's in their genetic material. But sociopaths are created specifically through trauma. Now it's worth noting that all of these things occur on a spectrum. Sometimes when you're asked why you're so upset, it's because your reaction really is above how most people would react. It's worth repeating, no one sign from this video indicates someone has antisocial personality disorder. Any real ASPD diagnosis would have to come from a trained professional. This video isn't meant to arm you to go out into the world and try to diagnose people. But hopefully, you feel like you've learned more about the mind of a sociopath and little red flags will pop up next time one does try to manipulate you.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Learning things slowly is a bummer but unfortunately, that is the route that I see most people go when it comes to learning confidence and charisma. Either they don't try to learn it all or they spend 10 times longer trying to take skills and integrate them when it could be done much more quickly. And that's exactly why in this video, I want to give you five tips for taking everything that you've learned on this channel about confidence, charisma, and perhaps elsewhere and making it an unthinking habit much, much more quickly. Now this is actually a fan question that we received on the podcast but I think this answer is important enough to share with you here on the main channel. So here it is. So Ben made a handful of the videos. I've made a lot of the videos and in the last six months, I've started to get help researching which was really nice. But then I was like, okay, I wonder if someone can help me research. I wonder if I can be involved sort of as an advisor role and somebody else can do the writing of the script. I'll be like, ah, here's an interesting point, here's an interesting point. But also this person would need to find interesting points on their own. So just that's the background is what we've been trying to do. And one of the things that we realized is this person is they're very smart, they're very hardworking, they write very well, but they don't have the same handle on charisma. Yeah. Right? And so you're going to train them on how to be a better writer. I'm going to start training them on how to learn charisma. Yeah. So I thought it'd be interesting to talk on podcast about how do you learn charisma as quickly as possible because I need this guy to learn charisma as quickly as possible. Yeah. So the first thing that we discussed last night, which I'm sure of, is this can't be simply an intellectual exercise. I think some of the, since we've been working with writers, it's a thought process, which is important where you experiment in your mind and you go, oh, what would happen if this person had done this? Or what would happen if they did the opposite? But what is critical is that you take some of those hypotheses out into the real world in your life and see how they apply. Because what is occurring on Graham Norton's show is not going to port one for one exactly to every situation that you're going to encounter in the office. So that's the first thing is to come up with hypothesis by watching your friends, family, other people who are charismatic. Like, oh, I think his stories are good because when he's talking, he takes a really deep breath before he hits that main point. I'll try doing that in my life. I'll see if it works for me. So testing, that's one thing that definitely needs to happen. Yeah. So I think one step before that is being aware of your own reactions to people and who makes a charismatic impression on you, good or bad. Because first, you have to come up with what am I going to test, right? So one way you can do that is watch our videos. But another way is you can just be aware in your own life, pay attention to the moments that you really like someone, that somebody makes you in awe of them, or that someone pisses you off, makes you uncomfortable, makes you feel creeped out, and note what that person did. Try to play the scene back in your head because that's what we did. We didn't have many charisma breakdowns to watch, right? But what we could do is just watch charismatic people. And when they get a big laugh or when we would go, oh my god, I really like this person, you stop and you think, what are they doing that makes me really like them? So we have a neighbor, Grant's roommate, who I really like even though I've never really spent much time with. And I realized it's because whenever the elevator's closing or whenever we're going our separate ways, he stops what he's doing for 15 seconds to finish our conversation. It makes me feel like he's genuinely interested. And I thought, oh my god, I really like this guy. Why? And then that's my hypothesis. And then I can do what you said and go test it in my own life and see how it goes. So yeah, I think that that self-awareness of your own reactions to people can be really helpful. And that's a great point. And that's something that you'll never see on the Graham Norton Show because you don't ride in elevators on the Graham Norton Show. But that's, yeah, that's just an excellent point. The other thing that really helped you and I was having one another. And I think I just can't skip that. I don't feel that way. You know, I've kind of got it on my own. The ability to bounce that idea off of me and then have me go, oh, wow, that relates to this thing that I experienced in work. But it doesn't work in XYZ scenario. Super, super useful. So can't overlook that. Anything else? Yes. Don't try to do everything at once. So I think this is why in Charisma University, there's one daily action per day. I think there's with our YouTube channel, there can be a sense of this is really fun to watch. I'm going to watch six videos. And you go out into the world and you go, OK, I'm going to touch like Chris Hemsworth. I'm going to make eye contact like Tom Holland. I'm going to tell stories like Kevin Hart. And it's overwhelming. And I know we did this. We just went, all right. Today, all I'm going to do is try to make eye contact with people. I don't have to speak. I don't have to be funny. I don't have to do anything but look people in the eye. And you do that for one day or three days or however long it takes to feel comfortable. And then you go, OK, now that is kind of an unthinking habit. Now I can focus on storytelling. And I think that way it's not so overwhelming. And weirdly enough, you'll get good much faster by only focusing on one thing at a time. Yeah, totally. That's huge. And even within one video, there's five points. Yeah. Pick one of them. You know, the videos have five points to be entertainment. But you got to pick one thing to do. And then one way to pick the things is that I get to do as a job, which is really nice, is to pick someone who you consider sort of a charisma icon. Someone that you like. And do that watching of a handful of their videos or even just five to ten minutes in the morning. So when I want to be funny, I watch The Best of Stepbrothers because I like Will Ferrell's sense of humor in that and I just steal his jokes. Or I'll watch Chris Pratt. And five to ten minutes before you go somewhere really does drive home the mentality. And then you pick one concrete thing to add to that so you have this underlying willingness to be absurd, to just have fun in the moment. And then you add on top of that, OK, I'm going to spice these jokes up with one particular thing. I'm going to double down in there. And then if you do that for a handful of days, you're like, OK, I'm starting to develop that skill. Now it's time to move on to something else. And I think that that would be the way that I would recommend that most people use our channel to go about learning it as fast as they can. Yeah, for sure. When I wanted to be more playful, I started watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine, 20-minute episodes, one a day. Incredibly helpful. It just incepts you. You almost can't help but start to be like the people that you're watching. Totally. Which is also why it's really dangerous to watch macabre or watch characters who are dicks for too long because you really can't. It is inception. You don't get to ignore it. It's like hypnosis. Yeah. And then you wind up being sarcastic because that works for this character in this particular role. And you're like, oh, what do you know? Good hypothesis to have tested in the real world because people don't really like it when I one up everything they say with my incredibly awesome zinger. There's not a laugh track. This doesn't work the same way it does in that particular TV show. So yeah. So good luck teaching. It's been interesting to do a meta-analysis of what is going on as I look at these things and also to meta-analyze what we've been doing for 10 years, which was we were analyzing people and now I'm analyzing myself as I analyze those people to try to find where we got most of our wins from. It's very confusing. It sounds confusing. One day. I wonder if it'd be interesting. I don't know if it'd be cool for the main channel to talk through the process of making one of these charisma breakdowns. It might be a sort of a niche audience thing. Maybe. I bet people will be interested in it. Perhaps on the podcast. I can discuss it in greater detail because it does get it gets to nitty gritty. And once you see how the sausage is made, you're like, kind of just wanted to eat the hot dog. I just want to watch. Yeah. I just want to watch your Peaky Blinders breakdown. Exactly. I don't need to know. I don't need to know. Why this took 30 hours. Exactly. And the timestamp that you wrote and all the points that didn't make it in. And yeah, it's not as it's not as fun and interesting as the final video works out. But I do enjoy it a lot. So if it's the right person, if it's the right person. So I hope that you have enjoyed those tips and that you start implementing them right away. If you're interested in checking out the entire podcast, you can do so with the description in the link below. But also, let me just say, I hope that you decide to check the podcast out regularly because I've been having a ton of fun with it. First and foremost, I am a philosophy guy. That's what I studied in college. That's what I spend my free time doing it. And I'm always interested in how that intersects with psychology, what's going on in the media today, and personal development. And the podcast, in terms of the reviews we've been getting, has reflected that this is something that we are passionate about. People seem to really enjoy it. So if you want to check that podcast out, it's something that Ben and I have been doing twice a week every week over on our podcast channel or wherever podcasts are streamed. I hope that you decide to stop in, take a listen, leave a comment, let us know what you're liking. But either way, I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 561}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"The first impressions that you are making often hinge on the smallest of things. It can be a gesticulation or a choice of words and it can make it all come together or fall apart. Now we covered a lot of things that go good on this channel but today, I want to cover five common phrases that you are likely using that are ruining your first impressions and give you things that you can say instead. So the first one of these is going to be, Sorry for taking your time. Now this is one that I hear when people land a meeting with someone that's higher in stature or they're at a networking event and someone seems really busy or they just lack confidence. The first thing out of their mouth is, Sorry for taking your time. Now this does two things. First off, you've immediately put them into, I'm going to take from you defense mode because you've said you want to take their time and when you say, Sorry, you're implying that you're about to do them wrong and it makes everything that comes out of your mouth after that be viewed through this lens of this person is taking from me, I don't feel comfortable opening up to them. Much stronger than this, if you want to be gracious, is to say, I appreciate you making time when you first walk into a meeting, for instance. This recognizes that they might be busy but it doesn't imply that you are a time sucker or a time waster. And if it is true for you, though there are salesmen who use this all the time when it isn't true, is to say, Hey, look, I only have a few minutes and then to continue. When you do this, you are putting yourself in the position of the person who has a busy day. This isn't the highlight of your day, it's part of your day, you're excited to be there but you've got to get somewhere else shortly. Again, I don't recommend using this as a tactic or a lie but in the event that it is true, it can really position you as someone who, like you are, has valuable time to give. So the second one here is probably the number one thing that I hear and it's the number one tip I give people who want to make better first impressions and it's to cut the word fine out of your first impression vocabulary as in, Hey, how are you? I'm doing fine, thanks. The problem with fine is that it is the most common word that people use to describe their first impressions next to good and if you think of your life and all the first impressions that you have, probably thousands of people, how many of those made a good first impression? It was not the normal one. These were people who did something extraordinary. So if you're starting off being just fine or good, you're in that bucket of everyone else who I will forget in probably 10 minutes. Much stronger is to come out and be excellent, fantastic, great, amazing, whatever it is. So if you feel good, let it show in your word choice and in your tonality. If you still don't really feel great, it's not that kind of day, at least be solid. Solid is different enough from fine that it stands out and if you're having a really bad day, you could actually do better rather than just covering up with, Yeah, I'm fine, thanks, to at least get into it. You don't need to complain, you don't need to whine about it but in sharing a bit more about what happened, you're at least distinguishing yourself from the mass of people who are fine which is huge. This is actually the first day of our course, Charisma University, because I think it is the most important thing that you can do instantaneously to improve your first impression so I cannot overstate its value. Make sure you're doing this. The third one that follows on this one's heels is Hey followed by a long silence. So you're talking to someone, they say, Hey, how are you? You go, Hey, and there's nothing. The problem here is that people want to converse with people who make conversation feel effortless and if they're sitting there going, Oh God, what do I say? What are we going to talk about? That conversational thread just died. They're going to get out of there and they're going to talk to someone who doesn't make them feel like that. So what you can do to make sure that people want to stick in conversation with you is make it feel more effortless by giving them a particular line of conversation to answer, respond, or speak to. So you might say, Hey, if it's a group of people, how do you guys all know one another? At least they know what they can talk about and then conversation can evolve. Or, Hey, what brings you all out tonight? Or, Hey, what made you decide to come to this networking event? Are you working on anything? Any sort of line of inquiry beyond Hey is going to help so much and if you ever hear yourself just say, Hey, add anything to it — it will go a long, long way. So the fourth thing here is very common to Los Angeles and I think other big cities and it's in a first impression scenario where you hear someone say, Nice to see you. And what they are doing is they are trying to mask the fact that they do not know who they have met before and who they haven't. So in an effort to not get caught, they're just saying nice to see you to everyone. The problem is that very quickly, you can tell this is insincere and whatever comes next, you're wondering if this person is just a smooth operator who you can't trust and it ruins the whole thing. There's a higher level principle here which is if you don't know something like someone's name or if you've met them before, simply own it. So in the case of nice to see you, you might say, You look really familiar. Have we met before? If you get it wrong, no harm, no foul. If you get it right, they might even appreciate the fact that you recognize them and okay, maybe you talked to them for 30 minutes and you forgot but it's better than trying to play it cool and getting it wrong. Same thing with names — if you forget someone's name, go, I'm sorry, what was your name again? David. Got it. David. Repeat it back to yourself a couple times and remember it this time — it goes a long, long way. And the fifth one, there's a large category of these but it goes something like, can I buy you a drink or can I buy you a cup of coffee? It's any sort of material exchange in that first impression in exchange for that person's time. I've never had someone in a bar as a female ask to buy me a drink but I have had people from Charisma on Command who are maybe fans or wanting to do business ask to buy me a cup of coffee and I can tell you the psychology that goes on here which is very much under the radar is that you instantly go into exchange mode because what they have offered is a material good and now, I'm not evaluating this person on if I enjoy their conversation or if they're fun or interesting. I'm thinking, oh wow, they want to purchase my time in exchange for a $5 cup of coffee. That doesn't really feel like a good deal and even if it's someone that I might have felt neutral about, I begin to assume that that is a take because they have to give me a cup of coffee in order to get it. Same thing, if you're purchasing someone's three minutes at the bar by buying them a drink, it's not a strong way to make a first impression because you are essentially buying their time. Believe it or not, much stronger is to not buy them anything. So if you said to me, better would be, would you like to chat over a cup of coffee? I don't really drink coffee so I might suggest something else but I would feel more comfortable with that because now it's not an exchange of material good for something that you have, I'm evaluating you as a person. Do I enjoy this person's company? Might it be an interesting conversation? They don't have to give me anything so I can view them in their totality and I'm more likely to say yes. Now if you want to go above and beyond, you don't have to do this with me if we ever meet, but with that person and they do come out, just buy them the cup of coffee or the drink anyway. Don't ask permission, just do it. This makes such a better first impression on that person because it is not expected, it is a surprise, and it hits so much harder. So again, higher level principle here — do not purchase someone's time, don't offer them anything menial for it, ask them to exchange a fun interaction or an interesting interaction or a useful business idea and if there is lunch and you want to, you can pick up the tab as well to really make a killer first impression though that part isn't necessary. So I hope that you guys have found this video useful. These are five things to not do. If you want to know all the things that you can do to make a killer first impression, and to carry on an excellent conversation, check out our course, Charisma University. So I mentioned this — day one is being better than fine but the entire course is a 30-day course that you do over six weeks that helps you to build the habits that make you feel more charismatic and confident so that you nail first impressions every single time.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Hugh Jackman is one of the most charming people in Hollywood. And the best part about his style of charisma is that once you get it down, it's effortless. Specifically, Hugh has six habits that make him charming to almost anyone he meets. Once you learn a few of these habits, you can go into any conversation with confidence, knowing you'll find it easy to make people smile, laugh, and love being around you. My hunch is you get this a lot. Just seeing your face has lifted my spirits. Your natural sort of sense of self lifts people around you. Do people tell you that? We all have some degree of natural charm when we're comfortable, but we lose this in situations where we feel like we're being judged and need to impress, like in a job interview, a first date, or when meeting a new group of people. So the first trick you can steal from Hugh is to reframe those situations that make you nervous. Here's Hugh explaining how he does this for audition. I used to always go into an audition as though it was a rehearsal. If they said, look, I think you should sit down in the chair and say, you know, I think the character would stand. And so it wasn't just, you've got all the power and I'm trying to please you, but rather we're trying to work together. So for instance, if you find yourself entering a date or an interview feeling pressure to perform or impress, make sure you find time to ask questions designed to see if you, like them, too. This will reframe the situation in your mind and give you more confidence. Another thing that helps you tremendously is that he's doing something he loves. In a way, when I'm on stage, it's probably the most calm I feel. Most people screw this up when they're making plans with someone for the first time because they try to plan something they think will impress. Instead, make plans to do something you'll enjoy in a setting that will make you comfortable. If you're relaxed and having fun, then you'll feel more confident and you'll perform better. Hugh applies this to everything from athletics to singing to acting, and it's true of conversations as well. He calls it the 85% rule. Here's him describing it on The Tim Ferriss Show. I think they call it the 85% rule. If you tell most sort of A-type athletes to run at their 85% capacity, they will run faster than if you tell them to run 100 because it's more about relaxation and form. This also sets you up well to succeed at the second habit that makes you incredibly charming. He's a master at being contagiously positive. Simply put, people love being around you, Jackman, because he makes them have fun and feel good about themselves. And you can be confident that people will love being around you if you can do the same. This starts with a mindset. Your first goal in social situations should be to have fun yourself. Hugh applies this even in high-stakes situations like hosting the Oscars. When I hosted the Oscars, I was like, wow, man, this is a billion people. And I just thought, okay, whatever you do, just remember you're a kid from Maroonga in Sydney. You're hosting the Oscars, have some fun. And you can see this in action when Hugh is performing at the Oscars. Notice the audience reaction when he can't help himself from laughing. Fell behind. My Batmobile took longer than I thought to design. The reader. I know I need to see the reader. Hugh has the classic signs of happy confidence — a big smile and a big laugh. But what makes his positivity so contagious is how encouraging he is with other people when they start to join in. Watch how he engages with what this interviewer is saying. My dad loved you, but he never got your name right. What was it? Stu Jackson. Much better name. He asks her a question, laughs, and compliments the punchline. This is less than 30 seconds into the conversation. Imagine if you were her. How this would set a tone for a great interaction. Here's another example from the same conversation where they try to sing together. Note that Hugh is a Tony award-winning singer and she self-admittedly cannot sing. She easily could have felt self-conscious, but his high five and encouraging words make her feel good for joining in. If you smile big, laugh loudly, and encourage other people when they become playful, they will love being around you. Now that said, the goal is not to be fake. It's to get in touch with your natural playfulness and positivity. Hugh's next habit actually helps tremendously with this. And it makes you feel more confident and look more confident to the people around you. This may seem counterintuitive, but it's to give yourself permission to admit to emotions beyond happiness. Most people think admitting to certain emotions shows some sort of weakness, but Hugh is confident sharing emotions many men wouldn't be. Sort of barely next to him and I was just weeping. And I was nervous, man. I was really nervous. All my head is saying, you're gonna screw this up. This is yours to lose, right? The reason this is charming is because everyone has these feelings. So when you share them, people connect with that experience and they respect you because you're sharing something they'd be scared to share. This also helps your confidence because you train yourself to realize there's no emotion you have to hide or pretend you don't feel. And it makes the conversation more effortless because you don't have to worry about pretending to be someone you're not. This ties directly to Hugh's next great habit. He owns his flaws and isn't afraid to talk about them. For instance, here he is talking about being weaker than the guys he worked with when he did a cameo in professional wrestling. When the guy said you hit me like a girl, did you feel emasculated? You're like, don't say that to me. Did you get pissed off? No, he was absolutely right. I'm an actor. If you hit me, I cry. It's the real world. As another example, listen to him tell a story about when he was cast to play a part in a musical that was outside his vocal range. I said, but I can't sing that. You'll be fine. And every night I would go out there. Every night. There was three performances. Every night. I went out there, Maria, Marie. And for one last example, listen to him tell this story about his dad and watch for the interviewer's reaction at the end. No matter anything I've ever done, acting-wise, he says exactly the same thing. Hugh, wonderful work. Van Helsing, it just really... Van Helsing got terrible reviews and the fact he's willing to poke fun at it goes over incredibly well with the audience. Now that said, in your own life, it's best if you start with flaws you aren't terribly insecure about rather than stories that highlight your deepest insecurities. Save those for once this becomes something you're very comfortable doing and that you're getting great reactions from. A good place to start is simply being able to laugh when you mess up or make a mistake. One thing that will help you share your flaws charismatically is being a good storyteller. Hugh is particularly good at telling sticky stories. They grab your attention and keep it. He does this by focusing first on saying a hook that builds curiosity. I don't know if I've told anyone this by the way. Um, anyway, um... Wow, this is another story I don't think I've told but... She didn't know... Oh God, it is an embarrassing story. Start your stories with a hook like that and you can be confident that you will grab people's attention. If you aren't sure how to hook people into your story, a great go-to is to explain why it was a high-stakes situation for you. Here's an example from Hugh. We did four workshops over four years. There were about 80 people with a checkbook in there. Like, so it was will this or will it not happen based on this one performance. Watch how as he continues to tell the story, he reinforces that this was a high-stakes situation. I had 80 stitches in my nose and I plastered up and said, great, I'm back to rehearsal. We're gonna sing tomorrow and he goes, no, no, no, you can't sing tomorrow. You know, because it may, the stitches may come apart. And I said, you don't understand. This is our make or break. Set your stories up with curiosity and stakes and people will be captivated. Now, we can't discuss Hugh Jackman's charm without touching on perhaps his greatest strength of all. He has an incredible ability to make the people around him feel special. One of the best ways Hugh does this is with his oh wow compliment. I would never forgive myself, Gary. If I didn't tell you, you are one of the greatest actors to have ever lived. You're one of my inspirations. A genuine compliment that feels special is one of the fastest ways to make someone like you. But compliments can go wrong in two ways. If it seems like you're just saying it to be polite or like you're sucking up. In this next clip, notice how Hugh's compliment could have come across as just being nice but then watch what he does to make it feel genuine. There I was sitting next to one of my heroes and I'm not just saying that to be nice. I was at drama school watching the John Barton How to Play Shakespeare tapes with Patrick playing Shylock and I thought one day I want to work with him and there I was. Hugh adds context to the compliment which makes it obvious he's being real. Here's another great one. You can tell that initially this compliment doesn't mean much to Emily. Listen, don't undersell what you did. Julie Andrews is unbelievable in every single way. You are unbelievable in every single way. Now watch her reaction as he adds context to the compliment. It's also you go in as someone who knows musical theater and movie musicals. You go in like that's a lot. You've taken on a lot. That's a big hard like that's a... And from the opening scene, you just go, ah. Oh, you're the best. By adding context, in this case, that his compliment comes from his own experience in musical theater, he gets Emily to laugh and feel the compliment comes from a real place of appreciation. We've covered compliments in detail in other videos but just to quickly review, the best compliments will be something you genuinely appreciate about the other person, something the other person takes pride in and ideally something they don't hear complimented often. If you can get all three, you'll make someone light up and love you for it. Now that said, delivering that type of compliment might be something you're not comfortable with at the moment. So there's a much easier way to make someone feel special that you can be confident you can pull off in any conversation. Eye contact. This is something we've all heard before and yet many of us don't actually use eye contact correctly and Hugh is world-class at it. For example, how often do we see celebrities answer fan questions by looking around vaguely at an entire auditorium? Watch what Hugh does instead. Wants to know what was it like for you to say goodbye to that character last year? Jenna, you there? He gives his full attention to whoever he's speaking to whether it's an A-list celebrity or an audience member he doesn't know. This is a powerful thing. What most people do is listen with eye contact but then break it when they're speaking. In our Tom Holland video, we talk about how to spread eye contact around while telling a story to keep an entire group captivated but what you can learn from Hugh is how powerful it can be to lock in on someone after they've asked you a question. Having the full focus of someone you like feels amazing and once you start doing the other habits in this video, you may find people even start to ask you questions just to try to earn your undivided attention. Now, hopefully, this video has given you the tools to enter any conversation with confidence knowing how to make anyone have fun and feel good. If social confidence is an area you really want to improve, I recommend checking out our course Charisma University. It's a step-by-step online program guaranteed to make you more confident and charismatic in just 30 days. Over 5,000 people have joined the program and here's what just a few of them have had to say about it. First, before CU, I sucked at having conversations and I had low confidence around people but I am way more confident now having gone through the daily action guides and I can see a big difference in the intention and respect that I get. It makes life so much more fun. I don't think it's an overstatement to say charisma is literally a gateway to getting anything you want in life so thank you for making Charisma University. Another member wrote, After completing only just a few CU modules, my biggest breakthrough has been gaining more confidence. If you knew me a year ago, you'd see a socially awkward guy but that same guy had hidden confidence and charisma that has now been unleashed. If you're reading this or listening right now, think about who you want to be in a year. This course will teach you how to be that person. And this last one comes from a guy who says CU helped his dating life. He says, Firstly, loving the course. I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation module. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we're dating.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Look under any YouTube video of Simu Liu and you'll see commenters praising his charisma. He's new to being an A-list celebrity but he's making an incredible first impression. So in this video, we're going to go through six mistakes most people make during their first impressions and six habits you can learn from Simu that will let you make an amazing first impression instead. These habits are super easy to do. Most people just don't know to do them. Once you learn a few of these habits, you'll find that the people you meet start thinking stuff like this after meeting you. The first thing you can learn from Simu is how to make an entrance. Most people mistakenly think a first impression starts when you start speaking, so they don't pay attention to how they enter a room or what they're doing before getting into a conversation. Your first impression actually starts as soon as someone first notices you. For an over-the-top example of a strong entrance, watch how Simu enters a talk show. In your own life, you obviously don't have to dance as you enter every room but these examples highlight two easy habits that can help you make a good first impression — confident body language and positive energy. At a party, that might look like those last two clips but at a work meeting, classroom, or a calmer social event, it can be as simple as walking in with your head held high, shoulders back, a smile on your face, and saying a big hello. The easiest mental cue to give yourself is to come in one energy level higher than the average person in that same situation. If you want one specific tip for how to instantly look more confident, get comfortable taking up the space around you. A common mistake that will make you look like you lack confidence is keeping your arms tight to your body while you speak. In contrast, watch how far from his body Simu's hand gets in this next clip. It may seem like a small detail but it subconsciously influences how people perceive you. For context, this is Simu at Comic-Con after being introduced to Shang-Chi in front of thousands of people just a few days after he got the part. One other quick tip for entering a conversation well once COVID is over, you'll want to lead with some form of touch. Depending on the setting, that can be anything from a handshake to a big bear hug. So for example, when you walk into a meeting rather than wave, shake everyone's hand. It takes longer but it helps you build an instant connection with the people there. Watch Simu again at that Comic-Con convention. This is when he was first introduced. Wow. Okay, so at this point, your body language is solid and you've come in with big positive energy. Now the question is, what do you actually say? One habit that you can take from Simu is to look for observational compliments early in the interaction. In addition to his positive vibe, Simu looks for opportunities to be verbally positive. The average person goes into most conversations neutral in terms of their energy, tone of voice, and body language. Some people even make the mistake of trying to be cool by coming in aloof or standoffish. Instead, Simu actively looks to give a compliment. This isn't about lying or saying something fake. If you do that, it will seem like false flattery. Instead, when you start a conversation, ask yourself if there's anything you can genuinely compliment. If there is, say it. If not, don't sweat it. If you don't feel comfortable starting off by complimenting someone you've just met, there's another habit you can steal from Simu instead. Compliment the people in your life that you're already close to. Instead of focusing solely on trying to make yourself look good like most people do, spend time elevating the people around you. Simu will do this to their face but also when they aren't around. For example, here are a few clips of him talking about his parents and his co-stars Awkwafina and Tony Leung. Hyping up people you're close to when they aren't around is a great habit to have. First, if it gets back to them, they'll appreciate your kind words. Second, it highlights that you have close relationships with awesome people, which makes you look good. And third, it shows you aren't a tryhard who's always trying to center yourself and your own accomplishments. Simu's positivity comes through in another habit as well. He's able to be an encouraging listener. There's a few ways you can be an encouraging listener and make people love talking to you. The easiest is simply to smile and make eye contact as you listen. You can also call out if they make a good point or ask a good question. Another easy way to be a likable listener is to lower your filter and laugh easily. Watch in this next clip the difference in reaction between Awkwafina and Simu. Who would you like more if you were the woman speaking? Often, we think that in order to make a good impression, we need to be funny and charming. But people will also love being around you if you make them feel funny and charming. That said, it does help tremendously to be able to make people laugh. An easy way to do this during a first impression is to be playful when you answer a question. For a quick example, watch how Simu injects some humor into this answer from that question we saw earlier. Some people struggle with this habit of being playful. You may not be sure how to think quickly on your feet and come up with clever jokes on the spot. But that's totally fine because there's an easy way around that. Simply think ahead of time about the questions you're likely to be asked. We all have questions we know we get asked in almost every first impression. In Simu's case, during his press tour of Shang-Chi, it was very likely he'd get asked about his past tweets. Like, hey Marvel, can we make this happen? And then, like, on Monday, it sort of does. Wait, and I think the way you went about it, I don't know if this is true or not, but the way you went about getting the role for Shang-Chi is, you were, it started with tweets or something? Or is that really true? Wait for it. And it all started, this is what I love. Everything started from you tweeting this tweet in 2014. Yeah. Hey Marvel, great job with Captain America and Thor. Now how about an Asian-American hero? So did you have any expectations after that tweet of maybe them possibly reaching out? After 10 plus times of being asked the same question, Simu had his answer dialed in. And you may not realize it but in your own life, that same thing is happening to you. Think about it. What are the questions in your own life that come up again and again when you first meet someone? Maybe it's, where are you from? Or what do you do? You know it's going to be asked but do you have a home-run answer? If you want to get good at consistently making an amazing first impression and you don't want to have to rely on quick wit, then you'll want to think about the questions you get asked most frequently and have great answers for them. A great answer can either make the person laugh or showcase something interesting or attractive about you in a way that feels natural and unforced. If you want an exact blueprint for how to answer those questions well, you may like our program Charisma University. On day three of the program, we walk you through exactly how to craft great answers to the most commonly asked questions. You'll get fill-in-the-blank worksheets so that it's effortless to know what to say and you'll get exercises to help you get used to answering in a way that feels easy and natural. That's what's nice about Charisma University. We try our best to make the YouTube videos as helpful as we possibly can but in a 30-day program, we're able to lay out everything sequentially so you know exactly what to do each day to become more charismatic and each day builds upon the next. So rather than tell you more about it myself, I think the best way to let you know what CU is about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few things that people have written in. The first is from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I had, hands down, the best interview out of everybody and they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. Another person wrote in about their social life saying, It has truly been incredible. I've instantly had results that seem insane. So many more meaningful connections, my friendships have improved, my interactions with total strangers are a new exciting fulfilling thing. I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system. And the last one is from someone who says it's been life-changing. Your course has been life-changing to the point where I wake up in the morning feeling like I've been transferred to a new person's body — the person I kept dreaming of becoming before I found Charisma on Command. It is incredible. I found myself and I found what makes me happy. You'll see more stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. I make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course. If you want to check the course out, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description to learn more. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it and I would love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 661}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all been there before — you're talking to someone you like and you can't quite tell if they're flirting with you or just being friendly. Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me, aren't you? You might feel this uncertainty when talking to someone you've just met or maybe with someone you've known for a while but have trouble reading. Either way, in this video, we'll go through six subtle signs you can look for to figure out if someone is attracted to you. One quick note before we begin — for visual aids, we'll be looking at clips from celebrities but given that the cameras are rolling and these are actors, it doesn't necessarily mean these people are attracted to each other. Also, no single sign guarantees anything, but if you see several of them together, you'll start to get a clear picture of how the person feels about you. The first subtle sign that someone is attracted to you is something you might see while speaking with them or you might catch it even before being in conversation — it's preening. Examples of preening are standing up straighter, playing with or fixing their hair, straightening their clothes, or playing with jewelry. You can probably think back to a time when you did this while talking to someone attractive. Here's an example from Margot Robbie. These are things we all do some of the time, but when we're looking at someone we're attracted to, we do it for longer periods of time or more frequently. So if you notice someone fix their hair once, it might not mean anything. But doing it a lot can be a subtle sign they're interested in you. For example, watch a few moments with Craig Ferguson and Kate Mara. Her words give away that she's flirting in the first clip, but for yourself, you want to pay attention to the body language even during the more innocent parts of conversation. People preen subconsciously as a combination of nervous fiddling and a desire to make themselves look better. So in this next clip, notice how Catherine's hair touch comes after Craig calls her out on something. As you just saw, touch can be another sign that someone is attracted to you. But not every touch means the same thing. There's two kinds of touches to look out for that are subtle signs someone is attracted to you. The first is a drag touch or lingering touch. For example, notice how this woman's hand stays touching the guy for as long as she can. A hug can definitely be platonic, but if afterwards someone drags their hand across your arm or down your body rather than immediately disconnect, it might be a sign of something more. Here's a quick comparison of a platonic hug versus a drag touch. The drag touch won't always be that obvious, so here's a more subtle example. It goes quickly. Watch how instead of dropping her hand after the hug, she drags it across Cristiano's back, basically not disconnecting completely until the last moment she can. So next time you hug someone and you aren't quite sure how they feel about you, pay attention to whether they quickly disconnect or let their hands linger. That said, not every touch needs to be drawn out in order to be a sign of interest. The second touch-related sign that someone is attracted to you involves little touches, but frequent, unnecessary little touches. Here's an example of an unnecessary touch. It's just the two of them speaking, so she could've said this without touching his arm. One unnecessary touch doesn't necessarily mean anything on its own. It's when you see several back-to-back that it becomes a sign of attraction. Here's a quick example. I've been studying you. You've been studying me? Yeah, and I've been wondering what's going on here. And well, I sort of like created the link between this and this. Is there a link there? Is there something going? Is there a theme running? Yeah, it's a, you know, it's a sort of... Because I'm guessing how far that's going. Yeah, there were actually more states. Now as I think about it, keep going. I can get up. Don't make a joke out of that. None of those touches on their own mean anything. After all, some people are just touchy. So what you really want to pay attention to is if someone is touchier with you than with other people. That shows they may be attracted to you. Now, in times of social distancing, you might not see a lot of touching. Another subtle sign you should pay attention to is where someone points their body. For example, here's Robert Downey Jr. having a platonic conversation with Craig Ferguson. Slight correction, it's not the number one movie in America. It's the number one movie worldwide. He faces his legs and body to the audience, only turning his neck to look at Craig. Compare that to this conversation where the woman is completely perpendicular to her chair. That's what I just said. Okay. Help yourself. Okay. Looking at the two side by side, it's obvious who's engaging more with Craig. Here's another example where you can see a change in body language during the conversation. Notice how Tiffany starts with her body fairly even between James Corden and Jay, but as the flirting starts, she cheats her body more and more towards Jay. That was a clip of Magnum P.I. which has Mondays at 9 on CBS. So, you didn't answer my question, though. Can we go to break, please? She even keeps her body facing Jay while James Corden is speaking. We're never going to break. If we talk like this, don't worry. We're never going to break. If you see someone point their body towards you even while they talk to someone else, that's a great sign that the person is interested in you. Closely tied to this is another body-related sign that someone is attracted to you. This can be done in a variety of ways. The obvious example would be while speaking to you like this. A less obvious time that you might see this and not realize it's happening is if they fall towards you while laughing. She easily could have fallen backwards or to the other side, but she fell to the side that put her closer to Craig. This could just be by chance, but it may also be a subconscious desire to get closer to you. For a quick comparison, watch Alice Eve with fairly neutral body language with Conan, although she is facing him, and compare it to her body language with Craig. I grew very quickly. I grew like three feet in a year. That's awful. What? You can't pick and choose. Well, I suppose you can, actually. Yes, you can. Yeah, yeah, you can. It's a free country. It is a free country. Absolutely right. Well done, Alice, for reminding us that it's a free country. The last sign someone may be attracted to you is likely to happen before you're even speaking to them. It's the smiling eye dart. Here's a great example. In this case, Henry Cavill is looking at her first, but normally, it'll be when you catch them looking at you. It's normal for someone to look away when you accidentally lock eyes with them, so what you're looking for is that sheepish smile while they look away. That's to tell that they feel like they've been caught, meaning they were likely purposefully looking at you, perhaps because they have a crush on you or are checking you out. So now you know some subtle signs that someone is feeling attracted to you, but what if you're realizing that you don't get these signs thrown your way as often as you'd like? One of the fastest ways to make yourself more attractive is to boost your charisma and your confidence. If that's something you're interested in seriously committing to, you should check out our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step 30-day video series that comes with a daily action guide that's guaranteed to show you exactly what to do each day to take your charisma and confidence to the next level. And if for whatever reason you don't, then you get a full refund just by pushing a button inside the course. Thousands of people have gone through Charisma University so far and had great results. Here's what a few of them have said. I never expected such remarkable outcomes from a simple online routine. This course completely changed my mindset on how to approach people and think about myself. It has undoubtedly made a significant impact on my life. Everything in my life has improved from loving myself and others more to creating and developing amazing external relationships. There's so much more joy in my life and CU has been a huge reason for it.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, we're going to show you six unattractive habits that instantly make you look like you lack confidence and what you can do instead to command more respect in your conversations. The first habit is avoidant body language. This is anything that closes you off from the other person like hanging your head, not making eye contact, or facing away. Here's a quick example from a rough first date. Wait, wait. So, um, I'm sorry. Louis is a very nice guy but, unfortunately, his stuttering and avoidant nervous body language hurts his ability to connect with his date. Confidence is, like, the most important thing. That's it. That's all you need. Like, you have—the rest is there. Like, you've got everything else. Strong body language can immediately strengthen your first impression and make people respect you more and, luckily, it can take many forms. For example, watch John Cena and Matthew McConaughey in this next clip as John talks about his first failed wrestling persona as a robot. They have almost opposite body language so why do they both project confidence? And just when I said I would kick your ass at the fairgrounds on Sunday, I would rewind it and say it again for you. What did they say? I would kick your ass at the fairgrounds on Sunday. That didn't work? You—no. While seemingly very different, they both follow four key body language principles. They smile, keep their heads up to make eye contact, have their shoulders back, and take up the space around them. If you want an easy mental cue to give yourself when you're actually in a conversation that makes you nervous, just remember these two words — open and expand. If all you do is try to be more open and expansive, you'll naturally do countless little things right without thinking about each individually. And as a bonus, you'll start to feel more confident, too. Avoidant body language often goes hand-in-hand with this next bad habit — talking tentatively. Here's an example of it with Kristen Stewart talking about her role in Seabird. There was just so much about her that, um, you know, really only, like, were ever described in, like, general really dishonest headlines and, like, the girl from Breathless that, like, went like this, you know. This is no knock on Kristen. A lot of people struggle with filler words and stuttering and these habits often get worse when you don't know what to say. The solution is simple — give yourself permission to pause and think before you answer a question or even midway through a sentence. Don't fear silence. Here's a more recent interview with Kristen. Notice the difference in her body language and how she speaks and think about how it would change your first impression of her. I'm wondering if you planned to announce that you're engaged on that show or if he just kind of got it out of you. That's a good question because he is the best interview in town. Everybody knows that. No clue. I would have told him — I was going to say something really inappropriate. I would tell him anything. Once you get good at this, your silent moments of thinking can become powerful moments that build anticipation. Listen to Chris Williamson from the Modern Wisdom podcast for a great example of this. One of the things that I've realized is that people that are self-reflective, that rely on cerebral horsepower, that pay attention, that think in a detailed way, the more nuanced that your thinking is, the fewer people are going to be like you, which makes you feel more alone. How do you think people can overcome this? Replacing filler words and stuttering with powerful pauses is something that most people struggle with even once you know you should. Luckily, there's an easy way to quickly improve at this. The trick is to record yourself on video for just three to five minutes a day asking yourself questions and then answering them. On day one, start with easy questions you know the answer to that require little thought so you can focus fully on removing tentative talking. What do you do? Where are you from? Describe your family. Things like that. Try to speak at your natural speed and put your mental focus on catching filler words before you say them and replacing them with pauses. Then, from day two onward, slowly move to questions that require more brainpower like what is the meaning of life to you. Immediately after each day's recording, watch the video. Within one week, you'll see a noticeable reduction in filler words and an increase in confident pauses. Now that we've talked about body language and speaking habits, let's talk about what to actually say. The first thing you want to avoid when meeting someone is asking first instinct questions. These are the questions everybody asks especially if the other person is high status in some way whether that's famous, high-ranking at your company, or just really attractive. You can bet there are probably some questions that they get asked all the time. What's the most mispronounced? What's the worst pronunciation of your name you've ever heard? What's the worst butchering of it you've ever heard? What's like the weirdest one you've ever heard? If you want to have a great conversation that people remember, focus on asking questions that most people don't ask and that the other person is excited to answer. You'll know you've done it right if the other person lights up at the question. Can you recall an instance ever a time in which your formal acting training brushed up awkwardly with the realities of being on a Hollywood set? Well... That's a really interesting question. If you aren't sure exactly what to ask to get someone excited to answer, just ask if there's something they're proud of or passionate about. For example, listen to what Sean Evans asked Mila Kunis about designing her new house. Is there a detail of your home that you're particularly proud to have your fingerprints on and then is there one that serves as a reminder that marriage is always about compromise? Oh, really good question. The next common mistake is something you might see when you try to put yourself out there and mess it up and that's retreating after a miss. This is especially common after you make a joke that doesn't land. Texas has always led the charge. Well, till about like a couple months ago and then Austin sort of took over like, I don't know, guys, like Texas was leading the charge. You're still top 25. We got to work on that stuff because those people have lost their minds. Right? If this is something you have a habit of doing, don't retreat. Instead, joke about your bad joke. You were given an Oscar for best actress. You would also get one for being the worst. I think I just lost about 20 points on that one. If that seems too hard, there's an easier way to recover from a bad joke. For example, watch this news anchor bomb a joke with the Dalai Lama. So the Dalai Lama walks into a pizza shop. Pizza shop. Pizza? Pizza shop, yes. Pizza, pizza shop and says, can you make me one with everything? What's that? Yes. Now watch how he recovers simply by laughing at himself for how badly the joke bombed. Theoretically possible. Oh, I knew that wouldn't work. He laughed more at the fact that it didn't work. The next mistake will seem like an obvious one and yet it's something you've probably seen a lot throughout your life — injecting an unnecessary brag into conversation. There's a great example of this from the Liver King video where he tries to apologize for lying about being on steroids. This is a complicated topic, at least to me it is, because before social media, I was rich and anonymous and after social media, I'm still rich but no longer anonymous and I never expected this kind of exposure. It's totally unnecessary here to say that he's rich. Forcing his wealth into the conversation doesn't do anything to make his apology better or to make him seem likable or confident. This seems like an obvious one. So the question is why do people do it so often? Because most people want to be liked and they're not sure how to make people like them. So they try to force what they think makes them likable or admirable into the conversation. This isn't to say that it's bad to share what's interesting in your life. You just want it to come up naturally. For example, listen to Jamie Foxx tell the story of how he met Kanye West and ended up in his song Slow Jams. Then when I met him, bro, he freestyled a rap. I said, yo, they say you rap, he freestyled. I said, oh my god, you're the most incredible rapper in the world and I was trying to get music at that time so I would throw parties for a reason because Puff was so famous with music. I had a studio in my house and Kanye goes— Jamie mentioning that he has an entire music studio in his house doesn't feel like he's bragging because it's relevant to the story he's telling but be careful here because if people think you're telling a story just to work a bragging, they still won't like it. If you want to learn more about telling great stories, you can watch our full video on Jamie Foxx which I'll link to at the end of this video. The next mistake that people make is also something they do so that people will like them more but it undercuts your own self-esteem and it makes you look like you lack confidence and that's prioritizing being agreeable over being true to yourself. So, gang, are you hungry? Uh, I'm fine. Okay, we're gonna eat, I think. Oh, well, I'll grab food then. Okay. Okay, cool, cool. People do this because they want to avoid conflict or avoid being a burden. Ironically, it's the exact opposite behavior that lets you look confident and attractive and command respect from the people around you and that's speaking truth to power — being honest even when you're telling a potentially unpleasant truth to someone you want to like you. Iconic characters like Don Draper and Tommy Shelby are admired by their fans because they regularly show this kind of confidence. Can't I keep what I have and just build on it? Well, honestly, the unpleasant truth is you don't have anything. Your customers cannot be dependent on anymore. Their lives have changed. Your own protection is failing, Mr. Kimber. Your boys are taking cuts. I want to suggest that from now on, you contract out your racetrack security to the Peaky Blinders. Especially with people that are used to being surrounded by suck-ups and yes-men, this can be a very powerful habit. But speaking truth to power can be scary, so to build this habit, the easiest way is to start small. Starting today, stop telling little white lies. Even if you think they're harmless, start being honest about the seemingly little things like why you're late or why you're turning down a social invite. Build your confidence in being honest the same way you'd build a muscle — by starting where you can and then increasing the difficulty slowly and consistently over time. Eventually, you will have the confidence to share even the biggest hard truths. It may not go well every time, but it's the best long-term path to high self-esteem, high respect, and strong relationships. If you'd like a specific blueprint for building this type of unshakable, deep-rooted confidence, you may like our 30-day program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program that will show you exactly how to build unshakable confidence in ways that are easy, fun, and take just 20 to 30 minutes a day. Each day comes with a daily action guide so you know exactly how to put what you're learning into practice, and it's sequential with each day building upon the last. It also comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee so you can take the entire course, see if it changes your life, and if not, give yourself a refund from right inside the program. I could go on about the program, but rather than tell you what I think, let's take a look at what some of the members have said about their experience after the program. The first one comes from a guy who says CU helped his dating life. He says, firstly, Loving the course. I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation module. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for over a year now, but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we're dating. This next one comes from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I had hands-down the best interview out of everybody and that they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. And this last one is a comment, of course, from someone who used it mainly to improve their social life. And he says, life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. And there are many more success stories just like those in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you want to check it out, click the link on screen now or below in the description to learn more. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it. I hope that you decide to join if this is an area in your life that you're looking to improve. Either way, I hope this video has helped you and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 691}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Today you'll learn six easy ways to make people laugh and love being around you. The first is to play dumb. One way you can do this is to purposefully misunderstand something obvious. Do you know what this is? Okay, I haven't taken a lot of pregnancy tests in my day. In fact, like almost none. I did pee on it, so don't look at the pee part. So do you have COVID or no? Like what's? The key here is to act so oblivious it would be impossible to miss that you're joking. You screen tested for Iron Man. Was that the original Iron Man or is it one of the sequels that you screen tested for? I don't, I don't, I'm not aware of the ins and outs. I know that a wonderful actor, Robert Downey Jr. and I, we screen tested on the same day. And I'm still waiting to hear back and... As you just saw, playing dumb is a great way to get a laugh anytime someone asks you about something that didn't go well. It can help transform a potentially awkward or negative conversation into a playful one where you look confident and fun. Now, if all you do is play dumb in conversation, it will get stale fast. So you want to mix it in with some of the other jokes in this video. For the next easy way to make people love being around you, watch this clip of Dwayne Johnson answering the question, how tall is Kevin Hart? Okay, is this the legit answer because I know it or is this, do I with you on this? Which one? Go, I think you should go for what you know. Well, I'll go for what I know. Legit answer, legit, legit, legit, because I know you're my best friend. Four foot two. That's... That's... That's legit. That's an example of a sincerity fake-out. You set expectations that you're going to say something sincere, then you undercut those expectations for a laugh. Now, you don't want to do this all the time. It's important to be sincere when you want to connect with someone. But especially if the conversation is feeling a little boring, a sincerity fake-out is a great way to make people laugh and create a more fun vibe. Here's one more example, this time with Ryan Reynolds answering a question about how he got involved with Aviation Gin. 11 years ago, I remember reading a Deadpool comic and feeling like this is a once-in-a-lifetime connection. And then a few years later, I met my wife, and I was like, oh, I guess a once-in-a-lifetime connection can happen twice. And then we had our children, and that's when I realized that I love gin. So... That was... You just saw a great way to set yourself up to make people laugh, the three-point list. Set your joke up by listing off two genuine things, and then make the third thing you say an obvious joke. You can use this joke in almost any small talk conversation, specifically when someone asks you something like why you like your job or what you do for fun. In this next clip, Nikki Glaser uses this joke when describing what makes her inner beauty. I can't trust that someone's gonna see my inner beauty in line at CVS if I have no makeup on. They're not gonna sense that I'm a good friend or I'm funny or I do anal. They're not gonna know any of my best traits just by... This joke gets a laugh because it plays with people's expectations. You deliberately lead them one way and then surprise them with an unexpected twist. I want guys to feel good about it because you can have a good relationship with a guy with a micro-penis. There's obviously ways around it. You have toys, you have your hands. You can cheat on him. Like, there's things that you... No, you deserve love like anyone else and I would be with you. Once you've established a playful vibe like this, there's another easy way you can make people laugh. Exaggerate so much, it's impossible to take you seriously. For an example of what this looks like, listen to Theo Vaughn and Joe Rogan talk about the time Theo went four days without food. How much weight did you lose? I probably lost about four pounds, the pounds I needed too, you know? But I got clear, man, and I could hear, swear to God, y'all could hear somebody fold a piece of bread from 80 feet away, bro. I was so hungry, dude. I could hear a skittle hit the cement across the street. Almost any time you wanna get a laugh, you can just describe something using over-the-top exaggeration. For another example, listen to Tim Dillon talk about the Ellen workplace controversy. You're allowed to be nasty to people, you're accomplished, you're a comedian, you did the whole thing. What you're not allowed to do is have a Guantanamo Bay situation in the backstage of your show where everybody's walking around afraid for their life and it's like Abu Ghraib where they're hooked up to wires. This is especially powerful if you're being negative. In general, no one likes to listen to someone complain, but if you use over-the-top exaggeration, you can make it fun for the people around you. For example, listen to Ryan Reynolds discussing working with a child actor for the first time. Yeah, you know, I was nervous. I mean, you know, when you're working with a child actor, the first thing you think is, I want to take my life with fire. Right. But, you know, there's that. Now let's talk about arguably the most charismatic joke you can make, a joke that elevates the other person. I get a sense that your fan bases are quite competitive with each other. No. Who do you think's winning? I'll leave it to his fan base. I'm the founding member of that one, too. And they're calling for a Loki movie. It's very sad. We are. Oh, we are? Most people do the opposite of this. They combine humor with a tease that puts the other person down, like this. I would marry him so hard and quickly. You don't marry someone. I would marry him all night long. I would marry him till he's sore. No, you don't marry. That's not. Don't what? You said it. Playful teasing can absolutely make people laugh, but if this is your only form of humor, it can leave the person wondering if you actually like them. On the flip side, if all you do is tell jokes that elevate other people, you're on the risk of seeming like a suck-up. It's when you mix complimentary jokes in with other styles of humor that people will really like being around you. If you aren't sure exactly how to make jokes that elevate other people, start with your trusty new habit of over-the-top exaggerations. What about you, Chris? Are you an app guy? No. No, really? You don't need them. Your life is Tinder. Your life's Tinder. You just walk down the street, and women walk towards you, and you just swipe right if you want them, and you swipe left if you don't. On the flip side, when making jokes about yourself, a great way to make people laugh is self-deprecating humor. Most people do the opposite of this. They tease other people and try to make themselves look good. This can work, but you run the risk of hurting people's feelings and looking like a try-hard. Ironically, when you poke fun at yourself, you can make yourself look extremely likable and confident. Here's an example of this done well with Hugh Jackman talking about his dad. No matter anything I've ever done, acting-wise, he says exactly the same thing. Hugh, wonderful work. Ben Helsing, it just really. Ben Helsing got terrible reviews, and Hugh's willingness to joke about it gets everyone around him laughing. If you worry that this will make you look bad, start by teasing yourself for things you aren't actually insecure about. That way, if other people double down on your joke, it won't hurt your feelings. That said, this is just a guideline, and once you're comfortable with these jokes, you can joke about whatever you want. Let's be honest, it was a difficult part. The guy who gets high, takes his shirt off, and doesn't get on with his wife. It's a big stretch. It's big. Most people are scared to make jokes like this because they want to look perfect so that people will like them. But people don't judge you for having imperfections, they judge you on how you perceive your imperfections. By joking about them, you show that you're confident being seen as you are. Now, one good general habit when you're making a joke at your own expense, smile. This lets other people know it's okay to laugh. For example, watch Bill Burr tell Joe Rogan a story where he has to apologize to his wife for an angry outburst. I put my head to the side of her head, and I just go, I'm sorry. I don't want to tell you, you married a. You blew it. You're not good at reading people. At the end of the day, for teasing yourself or teasing others, it all comes down to your intention and where you're coming from. If you're insecure and teasing yourself because you're in a race to do it before other people do, that will come through. If you're insecure and teasing other people to try to bring them down, that comes through too. When you're teasing yourself or someone else purely to have fun, not trying to play a weird social hierarchy game, then you can naturally flow between the two and people will sense your intention is simply to create a fun conversation. Do you want to trade blazers? Maybe yours would look nice. Yeah, no, mine's more valuable. All right, you got it, yeah, no problem. All right, listen, I'm just kidding. No, it's like. Actually, maybe not. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Definitely not. There you go, yo, yo. Now, making people laugh is obviously just one part of a conversation. Whether you're looking for a new mentor, more friends, or more dates, there's a lot more to forming a connection with someone than what we've covered here. You have to be able to confidently start a conversation, hook them in the first few minutes so that they want to learn more about you, and then build a strong enough connection that they genuinely want to see you again. If you'd like a specific 30-day blueprint for being able to do all of that, you may like our program, Charisma University. It's the fastest way I know of to take your confidence and charisma to the next level. Just listen to some of the things our past members have said. I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school.

They ranked me number one, and it's my current job. Thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma University, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. Life-changing.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Normally, earning respect takes years of demonstrating high character but there are exceptions and that's why in this video, we'll cover six psychological tricks that you can use to command more respect almost instantly and to do it, we'll be breaking down some of the most commanding presences that we've covered on this channel. The first trick to immediately command more respect is to upgrade your thin slice. People can make their first judgment on whether or not they like someone within just five seconds of seeing them and it's dramatized but we've all experienced the sense of liking someone as soon as we saw them, like in this scene from Crazy Stupid Love. He is funny. He looks like a carrot, honey. He looks like a carrot. Hi. Thin slices are necessarily shallow judgments and it can be tempting to chalk yours all up to genetic luck of the draw but you do not have to be Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone to have a strong thin slice. In fact, one massive lever in your direct control is your clothes. Now, the mistake that most people make here is dressing with the subconscious goal of blending in because they're subconsciously scared of being judged, they dress like everyone around them to avoid even being noticed and I don't want to focus too much on this but there are two quick fixes. First, to start dressing one level nicer than the situation calls for which will get you noticed in a positive way and that's exactly what you see from Ryan Gosling in Crazy Stupid Love and second, is to focus much more on finding a brand that fits and flatters your body type rather than on finding the most expensive brand you can afford. Now, after your style, the next easy trick to influence your thin slice and immediately command more respect is to physically take up more space. Watch here as Tony Robbins owned the space around him when he speaks and how it captivates his listener. You know, $300 a week, no, $2,500 excites him more that memory to this day than even the million bucks, you know, he did in his first 24-hour version, right, or you breaking the form in a mile. A million bucks, that must have been out of your mind. Tell me about that for a second. Now, physically taking up more space doesn't have to mean huge hand gestures that demand the spotlight. It could be as simple as sitting asymmetrically or taking up your entire seat and the goal here isn't to encroach on anyone else's space in some kind of dominance game. In fact, you can always adjust to make more room for the people around you. It's to subcommunicate that you aren't afraid of being seen with your body and that's exactly what restrained gestures and shrinking body language do. The easiest way to take up more space in a non-invasive way is with your own posture. Next time that you're about to enter a room, just take a second to roll your shoulders back a few times and increase the space between the bottom of your ribs and your hip bones. This will make you stand taller and you'll notice an immediate difference in how you feel as well as how people look at you. Now, the next trick is closely related to taking up more space and it's to get comfortable with platonic touching and yes, this one is on pause for the duration of social distancing but generally speaking, most Westerners are awkward when it comes to making physical contact with others. For instance, waving hello instead of handshaking and generally avoiding any physical contact after that initial greeting. But touch is integral to human connection and not just with romantic partners. Touch builds trust and creates a feeling of safety and of closeness. It's one of the ways Oprah Winfrey connects with people so quickly. Now, obviously, this has to be done correctly otherwise you can create discomfort and there's four key principles for making sure that your touch is appropriate and well-received. First, keep your touch to non-central areas of the body like the hands, the arms, the shoulders, and the upper back. Second, keep each touch to roughly under five seconds and if your touch lingers longer than that it can start to feel creepy. Third, be a universal toucher. Give a caring touch to the people around you regardless of your attraction to them and you'll come across as friendly and confident. But if you focus on just one person that you might have a crush on, you can seem weird and even predatory. And fourth, be mindful of how people react and, of course, calibrate accordingly. If you see someone stiffen or lean back, then you've gone too far and need to pull back yourself. Don't be like Seinfeld's close talker friend who is completely unaware of people's reactions. Hello, Aaron. Hello, Aaron. So how long are you folks in town? Three more days. Now that we've covered body language in our first tips, let's talk about the first trick that has to do with what you say. And if you want to instantly command more respect from the people around you, then don't allow yourself to be cut off mid-sentence. Most people think it's polite to stop talking when someone interrupts them in conversation. But when you let someone bulldoze you into shutting up, you're signaling that their opinions take precedence over yours and this is especially true in group conversation. Regardless of your political affiliation, if you've watched the Republican primaries in 2016, you saw this play a big part in Trump's ability to make his opponents look weak. As a candidate, he supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. I disagree with him on that. You are the single biggest liar. You probably are worse than Jeb Bush. You are the single biggest liar. This guy lied. Let me just tell you. Now to be clear, that doesn't mean that you want to step on other people and hog the spotlight talking non-stop or even talk more than others. But to command respect, you should always finish your sentences when you have the floor even if someone is trying to talk over you. Watch how quickly a young Jaden Smith gives up on being heard in this next clip. Yeah, no, that is something. Do you guys... That'll get you really humble really quickly. How can I keep you humble? Well, because people sort of often ask, you know... Now compare that to Jaden's father, Will, here. ...is going on the internet. But don't they just say you're cute and stuff? Like, don't they say great things about you? No, no, no. God, no. Will Smith, I liked him in Bad Boys, but he got some big ass ears. By coming in just a little bit louder than everyone else and making his sentence unstoppable, Will gets his joke heard, gets a big laugh from the audience, and immediately, Bradley Cooper is excited to hop onto Will's conversational thread. Now another perfect example is Russell Brand in the viral interview he did with MSNBC. I wouldn't do that. I'm going to disrespect your program. Okay. No, no. You did ask to see your fellow Englishwoman, so I felt obliged. Notice he doesn't yell, he doesn't rush to finish, he simply continues unfazed at his normal pace until he's completed his thought and then he defers. This is something you'd like to learn more about. We have a full video on how to stop people from talking over you that I'm going to link to in the top right corner and the description box below. Just one last caveat on this. This is most important in groups. If you're talking one-on-one with someone, you do not need to worry about this nearly as much. But moving along, the next counterintuitive psychological trick is to compliment your competition. The opposite, trying to tear down another person's successes or talents is a great way to quickly lose respect. Even if you feel justified in your opinion, sharing it makes you look bitter and jealous. Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you. I'm going to let you finish. But Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time. On the contrary, actually praising your opposition shows a confidence that very few people have. For example, here's Jordan Peterson who is religious speaking about atheists and atheism. There's a good case to be made for atheism. I mean, let's make no bones about it because you could say, in some sense, there's been 300, 400 years of brilliant scientists who've been doing nothing but laying the foundation for an objective empirical atheism. If you show this type of respect for an opponent's beliefs and achievements, people will immediately be more open to what you have to say and they'll respect you for admitting that there is strength on the opposite side as well. I am here tonight to say a few words about an American hero that I've come to know very well and admire very much, Senator John McCain. Now, bringing it back to your own life, two areas that this may apply are in work and in dating. For instance, when you elevate a co-worker by complimenting their work, you elevate yourself as well because you show that you're fair, honest, and confident. On the flip side, in dating, if you badmouth someone because you think your crush might like them, you actually just make yourself seem insecure and petty and turn off your crush in the first place. Now, there are exceptions to this, of course. There are people who can trash talk their rivals in a way that commands tons of respect. Muhammad Ali is a prime example of that. What a beautiful swing and the punchless Frazier clean out of the rain. Who would have thought when they came to the fight that they would have witnessed the launching of a colored satellite? This works for Ali and Conor McGregor because not only are they in environments where trash talking is encouraged, but there's also humor and over-the-topness to what they say. That humor is what turns a potentially arrogant statement into a fun, confident one. Now, the last trick to instantly command more respect is to openly share your shortcomings. Most people incorrectly think that you have to hide your flaws, put on a strong front, and fake it till you make it, right? The truth is more nuanced and that's because people can sense when you're hiding something especially if you're overcompensating. Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us? Oh, sure. Start figuring out where he is. Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you. She didn't dump me, you know. I dumped her. It's a mutual dump. In reality, people do not judge you on your shortcomings. They judge you on how you perceive your shortcomings. By being open about your imperfections, you show that you're not afraid to be seen as you are. This is the genius behind the final rap battle in 8 Mile. Rather than pretend to be someone he isn't, Eminem owns the quote-unquote bad things about himself and wins the battle ending the movie. I did get jumped by all six of you chumps. When you share your shortcomings, you're also sharing your shortcomings. I did get jumped by all six of you chumps. When you share your flaws and they don't embarrass you, it shows massive confidence. You can just watch the reaction that Brad Pitt gets for this award acceptance speech. Let's be honest. It was a difficult part. A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off, and doesn't get on with his wife. It's a big stretch. It's big. It's big. But you do need to know how to use this trick properly so that it doesn't backfire and the key is all in the delivery. You have two strong options here. You can say your shortcomings as a joke like Brad does here or you can say it as a simple statement of fact with strong eye contact, no stutter, and a downward tone. I had my ass kicked by a ragged band of elves. Any man willing to paint himself in the shadow of his failures will make for far more interesting conversation this night. Come, witcher. Take a seat by my side while I change. Now, all these tips work excellently but they are hugely enhanced by deep authentic confidence and if you want to learn more about developing authentic confidence so that these tips become more second nature to you, you might be interested in our course, Emotional Mastery. Emotional Mastery is a 30-day program that is designed to help you master your emotions and your subconscious beliefs so that you consistently feel better than you might think is possible and the goal of the course is to raise the baseline level of joy that you feel on a day-to-day basis which naturally spills over into boosted confidence. Now, the way this works is by focusing first and foremost on your relationship with yourself. This means exercises that get you in touch with feelings that you may have been repressing for a long time so that you can put an end to those moments where you're being controlled by fear of rejection, failure, or conflict. Now, a very common outcome is that members of the course realize that they want to share everything they've learned in their lives and help other people on their own personal development journeys so I've actually added a bonus section that is a crash course in starting a YouTube channel. This is something that I made at the very beginning of my channel. We had only 20,000 subscribers so it's a very tactical explanation of how to build a following from zero if that's something that interests you. Now, this is only the second time that I've spoken about Emotional Mastery on the channel before because we normally only offer to people who have joined our email list or the Charisma University program and that means that there's actually no sales page explaining what the course is about. It's just a checkout page. So if this is something that intrigues you and you're curious and you want to know more, the best way to check it out is just to check out the course directly with the link below and you can do that knowing that the course comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee that is absolutely for any reason at all. There's nothing that you need to do, nothing to fill out. You just go to the billing section, hit refund, and you'll get every penny back if you do it within those 60 days. But I do hope that you check this course out because it addresses how to live with more joy in your life and how to be less controlled by negative emotions that might be limiting you and they tend to limit most people. This is what I'm most excited about and I'm continually working to improve this course. It's also something that's perfect for use during quarantine. So if you'd like to join now, go ahead, click the link below. I hope to see you on the inside. Either way, I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 741}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Emotional maturity creates strength and resilience in the face of life's obstacles but pinning down what emotional maturity looks like and how it's developed can be hard to do. So in this video, we are going to cover seven specific signs that you are emotionally mature and if not, at least seven things you can do to begin your work on that. First off, emotionally mature people do not demonize exes or the people in their life with whom they've had a falling out. Now, that's not to say that you should overlook the issues that drove you apart from those people in the first place. It means that you recognize that in most cases, both parties contribute to relationship dysfunction even if it was just by staying in a toxic relationship. So if you find yourself talking about your crazy ex all the time, you might want to check yourself. Emotionally mature people are less interested in blaming and demonizing and far more interested in learning from their experiences which brings us to point two — when there are recurring problems in their lives, emotionally mature people recognize that they are the common denominator and might be contributing to those bad experiences. So if you often find yourself in a particular type of negative relationship, maybe you're being cheated on by multiple partners, you recognize that while they are, of course, responsible for their broken promises, you may be contributing by filtering for and being attracted to that type of person in the first place. Now, this isn't a mindset from which the emotionally mature person beats themselves up though. Instead, they use it to inspire themselves to reflect on the ways in which they can change and thereby change their results. The same concept is true of any recurring issue whether it's falling out with close friends, difficulty in selling a product, or people losing interest when you speak. If it's happening in multiple situations, emotionally mature people consider how they might be contributing and make it their own responsibility to break those patterns. Now, this does need a caveat which is our third point and that's that emotionally mature people do not take full responsibility for other people's feelings. This is a common pitfall as people become more emotionally mature so as not to be a victim, they assume responsibility for everything. And when someone — many times, it's a romantic partner — is feeling upset or depressed or angry, the emotionally mature person or the one who's trying to be adopts full responsibility for those feelings and tries to problem-solve on behalf of the other person. This may even be encouraged when the partner says, you made me sad or insecure or whatever it is. In these situations, it's important to assess fairly what your own contribution was. If you were a total jerk, sure, take responsibility and apologize. But if someone is blaming their negative experience on you in a way that you wouldn't tolerate from other friends, family, and loved ones, draw a boundary and don't let yourself get guilt-tripped and become someone else's emotional crutch. Now, the fourth sign of emotional maturity is that you get angry, sad, and anxious and that might surprise you if you think that emotional maturity means not feeling negative emotions. In fact, you may even believe that it's an asset to never get angry or to never cry but anger, sadness, and anxiety are normal parts of a healthy life. What is damaging is to repress those emotions either to look cool or to live up to some stoic ideal. When you do this, those emotions find ways out. Anxiety turns into perfectionism and compulsive planning. Anger shifts to passive aggressiveness, sarcasm, or just forgetting to text someone back. Sadness can become depression at how grim politics or the news are never recognizing that those feelings are coming from within. So give yourself permission to feel your own negative emotions. It's by acknowledging and moving through them that you can release hidden destructive habits. Now, this takes us to the fifth point. The flip side of that coin is that emotionally healthy people don't need to dwell or wallow in their negative emotions. Yes, they allow themselves to experience in them head-on without distractions but the goal is understanding and self-compassion, not victimization or self-pity. So emotionally healthy people can sit with negative emotions, allow themselves to uncover their roots beyond whatever might have triggered them in the first place and then, with care, they begin to problem-solve. You can give yourself what you may need to move on. Sometimes, it's a loving kick in the butt to get up and go exercise and other times, it's the space to relax and unwind. Now, when it comes to communicating challenging emotions, emotionally mature people are capable of speaking about their emotions without needing to get emotional so they don't have to yell about how angry they are or break down crying when discussing something that has upset them. They can instead honestly and calmly say, hey, when you did that, I felt really angry or it hurt my feelings when you... Conversations about emotions can become more productive because the emotionally healthy person can separate venting from problem-solving. And our seventh point is that emotionally mature people can pause. They often move more slowly in a high-pressure moments. In the face of aggression, they take a deep breath and wait a few seconds before responding allowing for better decision-making while still signaling confidence. When confronted with troubling information, they don't immediately assume the worst-case scenario but instead, consider more likely scenarios and possible approaches to mitigate any losses. The emotionally mature person recognizes that very few things in life require immediate responses and to pause, even if it's just for one breath, can transform their life. Now, whether you are living all these signs or just a few, you can always keep growing so if you want to quickly become even more emotionally mature, there are four questions that can break you into new levels of maturity and self-satisfaction. They've helped me with my own frustrations and anxieties and you can learn the four questions and how to use them in Loving What Is by Byron Katie.

      "[RIZZBOT] Starting transcription for rizzbot/Audio/8 Clear Signs Someone Is Gaslighting You (with examples).mp3\n",
      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"There are dangerous people in this world who will try to manipulate and control you. One tool they'll use is gaslighting, a form of emotional abuse that makes you doubt your own reality. This lets them get away with things that most people wouldn't tolerate in a relationship. So today, you'll learn 8 signs someone might be gaslighting you. One important thing to remember, gaslighting is a pattern. Especially with some of the more subtle signs from later in the video, seeing them once doesn't necessarily mean you're being gaslit. But be wary if you see these signs repeatedly. The most obvious sign someone is gaslighting you is if they genuinely attack your sanity. Here's a quick example of what this can look like from the movie Goodfellas. Ray Liotta's character has just been accused of cheating, which he is doing. People use gaslighting as a way to escape admitting they've done something wrong. So one potential red flag is phrases like, you're being paranoid, you're making this all up, or this is all in your head. A more subtle way gaslighters deny wrongdoing is by rewriting the past. Here's an example from the show The Bachelorette. For context, the guy is mad that his potential wife went naked bungee jumping with another contestant. No gaslighting so far, just a disagreement. But listen to how he responds later when she brings up that she didn't like what he said in that conversation. Rewriting the past is so effective because days after a conversation, it can be tough to have total conviction in your memory of what happened. But that conviction is the only way to protect yourself from gaslighting. Keep an eye out for phrases like, I never said that, or you're misremembering. If you're constantly doubting your memories, or you find you want to take notes so you can be sure you're remembering things the right way, you might be a victim of gaslighting. Now, as we just saw, completely rewriting the past is hard to pull off. So some gaslighters avoid outright denial. Instead, they minimize their bad behavior. Here's another example for you of what this might sound like, this time with Jada Smith trying to minimize having an affair. If you do feel like someone is trying to diminish your emotional reaction by using inaccurate or vague language, call it out. Another form of minimizing is trying to normalize bad behavior, so your sense that you're being deeply harmed gets overridden by the other person's insistence that everyone goes through these situations. Here's a few examples for you of what this might sound like. It's true that all relationships have their ups and downs, but this doesn't automatically justify all bad behavior. So if you notice someone making vague statements like this to justify something they did, get specific. If you were in this situation, you can protect yourself from losing touch with your reality by saying something like, most couples do go through conflict, but most couples aren't dealing with their spouse having an affair with their son's teenage friend. One final lesson from that Will and Jada conversation, keep an eye out for empathy hijacking. This is when someone justifies doing something hurtful or selfish by saying they needed it in order to heal. They are hoping that since you are an empathetic person who doesn't want someone to be in pain, you'll accept that this justifies their behavior. For example, listen to how Jada frames sleeping with her son's friend. You do not have to accept this frame. Being unhappy is not a free pass to treat you poorly. The next sign someone might be gaslighting you is if they regularly deflect blame onto you. Here's an example from the show Euphoria of what this might sound like. In this clip, Kat's boyfriend Ethan has just caught her in a massive lie, pretending to have a terminal brain disorder as an excuse to end their relationship. I feel like you're lying to me. Lying about a terminal brain disorder? That's sick. Now listen to how Kat tries to gaslight her way out of the situation by making him the problem. And to be honest, the fact that you think I would even lie about something that awful means there's a big problem in this relationship, which is like literally what I was trying to say in the beginning. No, no. Sadly, a victim of gaslighting can start to doubt themselves here wondering, am I the one causing problems in this relationship? It's easy to get confused because gaslighters use language that an honest person would use if they were wrongly accused. The only way to know if it's gaslighting is if you see a pattern of shifting the blame to you. So notice if you feel you're walking on eggshells around this person, because they always find a way to blame you for anything that goes wrong. The only way to protect yourself from this is to maintain conviction in your reality, which is much easier said than done. One thing that can help is stating your version of reality out loud. In the beginning, I feel like you started to break up with me, and then you pivoted to telling me that you got like a terminal brain illness, and now I feel like you're using my skepticism as like a reason to break up with me. That's your experience? No, I think that's the experience. Another red flag to watch out for is projection. This is when the gaslighter will accuse you of having the negative qualities or intentions that they have. For example, watch what happens when Ethan gives Kat a chance to end their relationship. Kat, you don't want to be in a relationship with me. And I get it. If it's okay, just say it. Just have like the courage to actually be honest, because what you're doing right now, it's just like feels like sh**. Here's the first example of what projection might look like. I... wow. I can't believe this. You're literally trying to break up with me. No, I'm trying to help you say what you want to say. A gaslighter will even go so far as to project their manipulative tendencies onto you. Yeah, you just gaslight me, tell me how to feel, all because I don't meet your expectations. This can be very confusing, especially if the person has gaslit you enough in the past that they've weakened your faith in yourself. You start to wonder, wait, am I accidentally doing this bad thing that they're accusing me of? That's their goal, to put you on the defensive and shift the focus away from their own manipulative behavior. A more common form of shifting the blame onto you is making your emotional reaction the problem. Here's an example of what this might look like from Jay Shetty's YouTube channel. For context, this guy is cheating with his friend Karina. I'm a little uncomfortable with you and Karina's friendship. What? Baby, come on, I told you. I just look at her like one of the dudes, okay? I really think you're overreacting. This is such an effective form of gaslighting because it's exactly what someone would say if they weren't cheating and you were overreacting. So how can you tell if you're being gaslit? One thing to consider is if you've gotten this feedback before from people that you trust. If so, it's possible this is just an accurate way to describe you. But if it's only this one person who accuses you of emotionally overreacting to things and it's mostly when you mention something they've done wrong, that's a red flag. So what's the impact of all these gaslighting behaviors? They lead you to regularly feeling confused, second-guessing your own feelings, and thinking there's something wrong with you, that you can't trust yourself to accurately understand what's happening in your own life. So what can you do if you feel like you might be in a relationship with a gaslighter? Here's a four-step action plan. First, speak up and share your perspective. Calmly let the person know that you feel like they aren't respecting your view of reality. If your partner seems to really be listening, acknowledges your feelings, and then permanently changes their behavior so that you stop seeing the signs in this video, then it's possible it wasn't purposeful manipulation. If the person tries to completely shut down the conversation and your feelings, that's a sign to move to step two. Calmly take space. Once you're away from the person, get other people's perspectives. This can be professional help or friends and family that you trust. Outside perspectives can help you realize that you've been a victim of gaslighting. This is why abusers will often try to separate you from the other people in your life. If you can confirm that you are in fact being gaslit, it's time to strongly consider ending the relationship. If you have a family member or someone you co-parent with who gaslights you, this may not be possible, but you can still work to create space and minimize the relationship. And if your gaslighter is a friend or significant other you don't share children with, your best path forward is to cut ties with them altogether. I know this is easier said than done, but when it comes to being emotionally abused, very often cutting the person off completely is the only path towards healing. If you are in a relationship with a gaslighter or if you have been in the past, please recognize that you are not flawed for falling for the tricks of an emotionally abusive person. This isn't your fault. Abuse can happen to anyone. It's recognizing emotional abuse that takes courage and strength. And by watching this video, you've already taken the first step towards reclaiming your life and regaining some of the self-compassion you may have lost. The next step is to focus on rebuilding your self-esteem and self-love. Get back to the basics. Prioritize your health by eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising. Get back to doing the activities you enjoy. Spend time with people who make you feel good about yourself. And potentially seek support from helplines, a therapist, or an organization specializing in abuse recovery. It won't happen overnight, but taking these steps will lead you to a better life with more genuine love, respect, and happiness.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 585}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"90 Day Fiancé videos have been making the rounds on YouTube these days and wow, there are some amazingly toxic relationships in that show. Unfortunately, it can be hard to recognize when your own relationship is headed for trouble until it's too late. So today, we're going to cover seven red flags that are early signs of a toxic relationship. Now, because this is reality TV, it has some extreme examples and everything is heavily edited, so we're only going to cover situations that are common in everyday life and that people tend to ignore. So we won't cover signs that are hopefully obvious like a 30 year age gap, a history of domestic abuse, or straight up telling you that they only like you for your money. So you're basically saying that you're just dating me because I can buy you things. Yes. The first early warning sign of a potentially toxic relationship is when someone, them or you, prioritizes being attractive over being honest. Sometimes, this will be outright lying about something to make themselves seem more attractive like Ed does in this clip. Am I what you expected you like? I expected you to tell me. I thought if I told you I was the same height, maybe I would have a chance. Other times, it might be holding back from telling you something important because they think you'll like them less for it. I don't want more kids, but she does. I didn't tell her sooner because I didn't want to lose her. This behavior is often justified like that — saying that they love you so much, they didn't want to risk losing you. And especially when it's something less important like height, it can be easy to write it off as a small thing. But even for something small, when you catch someone prioritizing being attractive over being honest, it's a red flag. This person is showing that they're willing to deceive you if it'll get them what they want. If you ignore this early sign, you may find yourself in a manipulative relationship. Another early sign of a manipulative relationship is if the person makes it a headache to not give them what they want. For example, in this next clip, the woman is seeing her long-distance boyfriend for the first time in a long time and this is the first thing she says. That joke alone is actually totally fine but unfortunately for that guy, it keeps going. You look great. What is the flowers? No flowers, honey. I'm sorry. I'm sure this guy cringed when a few minutes later, they walked past a flower stand. That is the flowers, coach. Yep, those are the flowers. I'm not going to buy you $20 for flowers. $20? At first, you might think this is harmless behavior. After all, she's definitely making sure this guy learns his lesson — bring flowers to the airport or get a headache. But you shouldn't be in a relationship where people are motivated by avoiding a headache. Instead, search for a relationship where you and the person treat each other the way you both want to be treated because you're inspired to without needing the threat of negativity. Nagging is only one of the common tactics for doing this. Another headache tactic to manipulate you is to attack your self-esteem, insulting you until you do what they want just to prove them wrong like Jennifer does here. Are you too coward? I'm too coward. For that. I am. Maybe you're not the right for me. Maybe. You're too f***ing for everything. The last common tactic that some people will try to use to manipulate you is frequent crying. Now it should go without saying, it's important to comfort a partner who is genuinely crying and has good reason. You'll have to use your judgment here. But as an example, watch what Darcy does after this man says he doesn't want to sleep with her the very first night they met. Do you want to sleep here and I sleep downstairs? No, I just don't really feel comfortable sleeping alone. Whether it's with nagging, attacking your self-esteem or guilt, if your partner frequently uses negative emotions to get you to do what they want, it's a good sign you're heading for a toxic relationship. Another early sign of a toxic relationship is when they say what they think you want to hear but then later their actions don't match their words. For example, saying they care about you but then being purposefully hurtful. I don't ever want to hurt you. Yeah, okay. And try not to ruin the next one. I'm happy to move on. I got bigger and better coming. But wait on. Another example would be promising to support you in something but then not following through. Before we broke up last year, he was like, anything you need, you can rely on me. I can help you. He was like, anything you need, you can rely on me. I can help you. Suddenly, he disappeared and I needed his help, like his support. As outside observers, it's obvious to us that if she gets back together with someone who promised to help her and then abandoned her, he'll just continue to promise the world and then underdeliver. But she gets back with him anyway. Why? Because when you like someone, you want the nice things they say to be true. That's why it's important that you maintain strong relationships outside of your romantic one. Your friends and family are often going to have a more accurate and less biased view of your relationship than you do. In fact, another early sign that your relationship is toxic is if your friends and family don't like your relationship. This seems obvious when you're not in the relationship but when emotions are involved, many people suddenly find themselves ignoring the advice of the people around them. My family doesn't know about this decision right now. I'm worried about how they're going to react when I tell them that I am married. They did have some doubts about our relationship. And this rarely ends well. What is the problem? I am coming back. I am coming back now. Here's another example where an 18-year-old girl is marrying a 27-year-old guy that she's been dating for less than a year. Reasonably, her friends have reservations about it but she just ignores them. So you're going to be married before your one-year anniversary even comes up? Yes, actually, yes. That is crazy, Evelyn. Maybe to you. Tuning out your loved ones can be dangerous when you're just in the early stages of a relationship. At the same time, you don't want to let other people decide how you live your life. So a good question to ask yourself is, is the person giving you advice someone you respect and someone who has had relationships you would want? If so, then that is a good sign to listen to their concerns. These strong external relationships are so helpful in preventing a toxic relationship that sometimes people will proactively try to distance you from your friends and family. They know that if they can weaken these ties, they'll force you to be more dependent on them for love and therefore more uncomfortable about the idea of breaking up with them and living without them. This can take many forms but one common one is trying to stop you from going out at night without them. They're concerned because they're like, well, I told them that you're not into, like, girls night. You want to go? That's not an option. You want to go? I want to go too. Another warning sign is they try to control who you text with like this woman who tries to get this guy to stop texting any woman he's not related to. Acting like everyone that is texting me is like bringing an intermessage to me. You're about to be married. You don't answer — literally, you shouldn't be answering anyone but your family members. No matter how you ended up here, whether it's because of infidelity or just insecurity, when you reach the point where one person can't trust the other to behave with integrity unless they're supervised, it's time to end the relationship. The restrictions will only get worse over time. I definitely don't have good luck in finding faithful men. From this point on, I can't leave the house without telling me. The reason people stay in relationships like this is actually the same whether you're the jealous partner obsessed with control or the restricted partner allowing yourself to be bullied. For both parties, they're not confident that they can find someone else they like who will be with them. This lack of confidence and self-esteem is a common factor in toxic relationships. I'll talk more about how to boost your confidence and self-esteem at the end of the video. Now, one big reason why friends and family might have a different opinion of your significant other than you do is because sometimes in toxic relationships, we see our significant others not as they are but as we want them to be. An early sign that you're projecting more onto your partner than they actually are is if you develop strong feelings before you know them. The most extreme example of this is love at first sight like this woman falling in love from a dating profile. I decided to go online to look for love and that's where I met Jesse. For me, it was love at first sight. This can seem romantic and certainly being that infatuated feels amazing at the time but it shows you've created an idea of someone and fallen in love with that invented version of them. We saw earlier how well that worked out for this guy. You know, the day that I laid eyes on her was like beyond anything that I could have ever dreamed of. If you feel yourself falling hard for someone in a relatively short period of time, that's fine but it's important not to make any permanent decisions based on that infatuation. You just don't want to end up like this woman who wants to marry a man she's never even met. I have never met John in person before and I am hoping for a proposal. This may seem like an extreme example but situations like this actually play out all the time whether it's eloping, moving in together, having a baby. This is especially dangerous because it's very common for toxic relationships to start well. In fact, a toxic partner will often make a better first impression than average because they wear more of a facade in the beginning of a relationship than most people do. Then once they know they have you hooked, their behavior gets worse. Eight months of this online relationship with Jennifer, we're finally here in Columbia together but our first moments in person have been a little rough. Now almost all relationships involve some amount of fighting but if you find your relationship is like a roller coaster with a lot of extreme highs and extreme lows, it's a good sign that it's a toxic relationship. Yeah, I think we're gonna be fine. I mean we fought a lot but we established that that's us. If you find that you've started to normalize things like fighting or constant breakups, then it's time to recognize your relationship may be built more on addiction and codependence than on happiness. You don't want to be describing your relationship like this. It's been really difficult. Over the last few months, we make up and break up almost every day. The biggest issue that leads to these toxic relationships is a lack of self-esteem and confidence. With true confidence, no one would behave this way or put up with this type of behavior. If something in this video has resonated with you, maybe you've seen these behaviors in yourself or in a past relationship, I highly recommend you check out Charisma University. It's our step-by-step guided program that's the fastest way I know of to build more confidence. It will also help you take your charisma to the next level, giving you more options in dating so that you won't be scared of winding up alone. Now you can read all about the details in the link below but I figure the best way to let you know what this is all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written in via email or the course comments. The first one comes from a guy who saw major improvements in his social and dating life. He says, life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. This next person used to struggle socially and saw major improvements after CU. They said, through most of early adulthood, I was shy, timid, and took a defensive stance on social interactions. Now I am more confident in social situations, will talk to literally anyone about anything, will have a good time even if no one else is, and I am more in control in interactions in my career and just happier. And this last one is from a woman who had just gotten back from a speaking tour. She says, last year I joined CU right before two public speaking events. Though I didn't do anything too terribly embarrassing while on stage, my lack of confidence was obvious to everyone in the room. Fast forward to this weekend, I owned the stage and spoke to over 2,000 business owners. It was so powerful that even my marketing assistant was completely lost for words. There are more success stories just like those in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60 day money back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. And it's 60 days, even though the course is only 30 days, because I want to make sure every single person truly feels like they're getting a ton from the course. Otherwise, you can just refund. So if you want to check out the course, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it. I hope that you decide to join if this is an area of your life that you're looking to improve. Either way, I hope you like this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 724}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"There's no rule book for how to have an incredible relationship and that means that a lot of us, myself included, make tons of mistakes. I'm turning 32 almost, October 5th, and as I look back on the last decade or so, I realized I've done some things wrong which is why, in this video, I want to share with you seven things that I wish I knew in my 20s and keep in mind, I am 32, I am unmarried, I'm very happy with that but you just need to know where someone is coming from before you take their advice so take everything that I say with a grain of salt though I still think I have a lot to share with people who do want to get married or who may be married themselves. The first thing, negotiation is a terrible, terrible tactic for change. People change because of internal motivation and unfortunately, I see that there's a lot of people out there that think they have this perfect partner if they could just change one thing about them, if they could be cleaner, if they would stop with whatever habit or be kinder to so-and-so, whatever it is. And if you're using cajoling, negotiation, or nagging to try to change that person, you may affect behavioral level changes for a time. It is very unlikely that you will actually affect changes on a deep level that needs to come from internal motivation. So a great example of this, I have a friend who has been dating someone for almost 10 years. They wanted to get married but she was a smoker so he said, look, I know we both want to get married and you really want to get married but I can't marry someone who is a smoker so you're gonna have to stop before you get married and of course, she stopped and then they got married and within weeks of the marriage happening, perhaps even before, she was back to smoking. There are no binding agreements especially when you're withholding saying, look, I'm not gonna love you as much or we can't move in together or only on this condition, if you change, will I get married to you. In any of these cases, what you need to expect is a backfire so you kind of have to get used to accepting the person that you're dating if you want to stay with them as they are today while being prepared that they may grow and evolve in amazing ways and in some ways that are difficult for you. The second thing has to do with chemistry. When I was in my 20s, I focused a lot on chemistry. Did I feel that physical spark? Is this someone I want to spend a ton of time with? Was I head over heels infatuated with them? And what I very quickly found out is that that is a phase that cannot last forever and when that is the bedrock of your relationship, well, there's not much there underneath it when it inevitably goes away. I find as I look around that some of the strongest relationships in my life that I observe are people who are fundamentally friends and so a really good question to ask yourself as you're dating someone is would I be friends with someone if I wasn't infatuated, if you took away the ability for us to be physically intimate? If the answer is yes, well, that's a great sign but if not, it's unlikely that this relationship is going to last for very long. Now, this can be tough to do because when you're infatuated, self-deception is the name of the game. You can't see any of their flaws, everything is perfect so a very good way to kind of cut through the self-deception is to observe and even speak to your friends. Your friends are probably like you and their relationship with the person that you are dating is going to be indicative of how you will be minus the infatuation because they're not infatuated with that person so if they can get along, if they're friendly with that person, that's a pretty good sign. But if a lot of your friends, most of them, even all of them don't have great things to say or aren't very interested in spending time with that person, it's very likely that you won't be either once the infatuation wears off. This isn't to say that you should date by vote or take a committee on this, this is just to say to recognize that they are almost like you in a few years' time in terms of the clarity with which they can see this individual so keep your eyes peeled. This might mean that you need to end some relationships based on what you observe but this takes us to point number four, duration is one of the worst measures of the quality of a relationship and unfortunately, I think it's the one that everyone uses. You hear, stay together, can they make it work, all of these sorts of phrases that we have in popular idiom, they seem to indicate that the only thing that makes a relationship valuable is if it continues till death do us part but I am sure that you know a couple who just makes themselves miserable and probably, you've had someone in your life who has entered for a short period of time left but was still a positive influence. So I would recommend and I know that I have tried to shift from the goal of staying together to the goal of making one another happy, to the goal of growing. If you're in a relationship, no matter how long it is where you're happy and growing, fantastic but if those things go away and they don't come back, it might be time to end it and there's nothing to be embarrassed about because duration isn't the ultimate goal. Now there's one goal that I think absolutely deserves its place here that doesn't often get mentioned and it's honesty. How honest can you be with the person that you are dating? And a great question to ask yourself is pretend that you're having one of those conversations with a best friend and you're talking about the person that you're dating. Imagine them walking in the room right in the middle of that conversation. Is that gonna freak out and end things or is that something that they've heard you say before? If you're withholding things from the person that you're with, it is my belief that that will cause deep sometimes unseen cracks in the relationship. It will build resentment, it will take you farther from one another, and while a lot of people, I see this on Reddit, when someone cheats, they say, for instance, don't tell them if the relationship has been great, if you just don't tell them about the fact that you cheated, you can keep things amazing, that's not ever been my experience in observing other people. Resentment festers when you cannot be open and clear so get to the point in your relationships where you could be sitting in a room talking to your friend about that individual, maybe not saying the nicest things about them but they know generally what you're saying, they know that you've recognized their flaws, you've shared them with them, and you are open and honest about them, that's gonna make things much, much better. Speaking of friends, this is a never ever ever, never ever give up your friendships simply because it's relationship time. I don't know how this happened but it seems like from the ages of 5 to 25, people think, this is friend time, this is where I invest in making tons of friends, having incredible experiences but from 25 on, it's career and nuclear family time. Nothing wrong with a career, nothing wrong with creating a family of your own but if you cut friends out, you will suffer. I think that we idealize codependence in our movies and our songs today and that's having that person as the center of your world but guess what? The strongest relationships, again, in my experience, are ones that are not the totality of both individuals' worlds. They are an important piece but they have friends, they have hobbies, they have things that they can do separate from one another so they're not completely codependent. So if you're at that age and you're seeing that everybody's pairing up and you're kind of losing touch, don't let that happen. Invest in your friendships, call them, reach out, make trips, even sometimes, and I've done this, plan to be in the same city to move and have work that allows you guys to stay together in the long term. I found it to be incredibly worthwhile and sometimes, when relationships end, it's the friends that are still the ones who are there. So this brings us to the last thing which has to do with communication. I think of communication, there's a ton to talk about here, but one of the things that we don't often hear is that you need to show your work emotionally. Now when you were in grade school or even in junior high and you had a test, it was frequent that you couldn't just write the answer. You had to show how you arrived at that answer in order to get full credit. Same thing kind of holds true in relationships and I learned this when I was about 21 years old, one of my first relationships. I dated a girl when I was studying abroad in Costa Rica, came back to the United States of America, a week or so after I had arrived in the U.S., she asked me, she said, Hey, I would like to visit you but I also have this graduation fund, I was going to spend it on a laptop, what do you think I should do? Should I get the laptop or should I come visit you? And I thought about it, I said, Oh man, so I would really like to see her but that's going to be one week of time and I know she's been wanting this laptop for a long time, she's been saving up, that laptop could last a couple of years, this is going to just be one week, I should probably tell her to get the laptop. But all I said to her was, I think you should get the laptop. And I later found out that she broke down in tears and cried as soon as we stopped talking. Of course, that relationship ended for tons of reasons, distance can be very hard, but it taught me an important lesson. If I had simply shared with her how I arrived at that idea, that might not have happened. Maybe she would have said, You know what? I know that you're afraid of feeling guilty that I don't do this but I really do want to see you. In fact, she was kind of just asking permission to do that and she was gauging to see if I was interested. The high-level point is when you are in conflict or even when you're just discussing with the person that you love and are spending a ton of time with, you need to show your emotional steps and how you arrived at the decisions that you have arrived at. It will cut through a lot of conflict, it makes things much, much easier. So those have been seven things that I wish I knew about dating in my 20s, I hope this helps. I did mention my birthday is coming up, I'm turning 32, so we actually had a birthday fundraiser for Charity Water and we set the goal at raising $110,000. Thanks to you, we blew past that goal. We have raised, at this point, almost $190,000 — that is thousands of people that are going to get access to clean water totally thanks to you, thanks to the Charisma on Command community. I could not have done this without you. Truly, this is the only birthday present that I want this year. It's been incredible. Thank you, thank you, thank you for watching, thank you to those of you who donated. It means the world to me. Charity Water is an organization that gets clean water to people who don't have it. So maybe they're walking miles a day to get it or maybe they're just drinking dirty water. Regardless, Charity Water digs wells, gets biofilters, has tons of other solutions so that a community has clean water for years to come which is truly transformative and super high-impact in terms of improving the quality of life. Now I have to say, I was inspired and I want to raise the bar a little bit so I'm going to be donating again to this campaign, pushing us closer, and I would like to hit because it would get 10,000 people water for 10 years — $300,000. Now, I'm going to be chipping in, Charisma on Command is going to be chipping in, but we need your help to hit that goal. So if Charisma on Command has helped you, if you want to send me a birthday present or if you're just inspired by the fact that, well, there are people out there who don't have access to some of the most basic things that we take for granted — clean water, things that won't get them sick when they drink it — if you would like to contribute and help the cause, go ahead, you can donate via our link, charitywater.org slash charisma. This was originally for the Keanu Reeves video that we did. You guys are breathtaking. I appreciate it so, so, so much. No matter what, it's been an excellent 32 years and you guys mean the world to me so thank you so much. I will see you in the next video. Bye.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 681}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all accidentally blown it in a conversation that we really wanted to go well. But that doesn't mean there wasn't potential for a good connection. Sometimes it just means you two talked about the wrong things. Luckily, if you learn to detect the subtle signs of dislike early in a conversation, you can change topics and potentially save their relationship. Today's video is a collab with body language expert Logan from the YouTube channel, Observe. Thanks, Logan, for helping spot these eight subtle signs that someone dislikes a conversation. The first tell is one of the most accurate standalone indicators. If you are standing and speaking to someone, look at their feet. Foot direction shows interest and people rarely think to fake it. So if their feet are facing away from you while you're speaking, it can mean they aren't interested in the conversation. If the person is sitting, there's a different tell to watch out for. Pay attention to the moment someone crosses their legs. You may have heard that crossed legs always signals being closed off, but that isn't true. Some people just feel comfortable sitting like that. But if they start uncrossed and cross the midway through a conversation, that can be a sign that you said something they don't like. For example, watch Jay Cutler after his friend, Sophia, tries to justify cheating on her boyfriend. You sleep with someone one time and then you'll never cheat again and like you don't ever talk to that person again. That's acceptable? It's not acceptable but like it's more understandable. Another thing to watch if you want to get a read on someone is their torso positioning. Here's an extreme almost comical example with Jimmy Kimmel and YouTuber, Mrs. May. How many views does your boyfriend have? He doesn't do YouTube or any social media. He doesn't do YouTube. Only a loser would not do YouTube. But hey, look, you wanted to look just as good as him, right? That's why you wore that shirt. In Jimmy's position, some people would see May smiling and engaging in conversation and think things are going well. But you see two different torso signs that she's uncomfortable. First, she's leaning sideways to create separation. Second, her torso is twisting away. She's turning just her head to speak with Jimmy rather than facing her shoulders towards him. You'd be amazed at how many people miss these torso signs especially if the person is trying to be polite by smiling and answering questions like May was. If you're not sure whether someone is torso twisting or not, keep an eye out for this next sign of discomfort that often comes with it. For context for this next clip, Jennifer Aniston is reacting to David Letterman licking some of her hair. Yeah, that actually happened. She's trying to stay positive since it's a talk show but notice her self-soothing gestures. Now the film, the film's already... People are off here going... I know. People are horrified by that. We'll take it out and edit it. Here's another quick example with Cara Delevingne when Graham Norton won't take the hint to stop asking her about the time she had sex on an airplane. And we were talking backstage that having sex on a plane. People who don't know body language can sometimes confuse these self-soothing gestures with preening gestures since both involve self-touch. Common examples of preening would be adjusting hair, jewelry, or clothes especially while smiling. These are normally a sign of interest or attraction. On the flip side, arm rubbing, neck rubbing, or nail biting would be examples of self-soothing gestures. Coupled with some of the other tells on this list, these are signs of anxiety or agitation. Now let's move to the face. The first facial tell to look out for is compressed lips. This sign may only show on someone's face for a brief moment but if you catch it, it's a great indication that the person doesn't like the conversation. For example, watch this next clip with Lance Armstrong and pay attention to his mouth after he's asked about the Livestrong brand wanting to stop partnering with him. There's another sign related to the mouth — the infamous fake smile. You can tell that a smile is forced or fake if the smile does not reach the eyes. People think to fake a smile with their mouth but most people don't think to fake it with their eyes so the eyes are a great thing to pay attention to when you're trying to read someone. There's another eye tell you should pay attention to as well and that's when someone's eyes narrow after you've said something. For example, watch Robert Downey Jr.'s eyes in this next clip. He asks Jimmy where his suit is from and Jimmy tries a joke that Robert doesn't like. You actually see a lot of micro expressions there. Robert looks away, furs his brow, gives the tiniest shake of his head and narrows his eyes — all signs that someone didn't like what you just said. Now, if you see a single sign, that does not necessarily guarantee that the person dislikes you but if you start to notice multiple, that's your cue to look for a different approach to the conversation or recognize that you and this person aren't a good match and start looking for someone else to talk to. Ultimately, the goal isn't to be a people pleaser who spends an entire conversation trying to make someone like you. The goal with learning to read people is simply to accurately understand the impression you're making. You want to be authentic and see who you really connect with. That said, people often confuse being authentic with staying stagnant. It's okay to learn new habits and grow. Some people are authentically kind, funny, wonderful individuals but they have some bad conversational habits so you don't have a chance to shine and show who you really are. If that's you and you want to learn better habits, I highly recommend How to Win Friends and Influence People. It's a great resource for learning how to make an amazing first impression and get past small talk so you actually have a chance to show your authentic personality and make a real connection.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Actress Millie Bobby Brown has a polarizing but effortless charm that has made her incredibly popular. So in today's video, we'll break down 8 habits you can steal from Millie that will help you immediately make people like you. The first tip may seem counterintuitive, but Millie is at her most likable not when she's trying to impress others, but when she is having a good time. If you've ever been at a party or bar and found yourself looking at the people who seem to be having the best time, you've felt the magnetic effect of having fun. In Millie's case, she'll start water balloon fights, do silly dances between takes, or get people to play random games on set. Even when suffering through insanely spicy wings on Hot Ones, Millie continues to be goofy and have fun. In addition to making you magnetic, establishing yourself as playful and goofy also helps you tease people in a way that makes them like you more instead of hurting their feelings, especially if you soften your tease with a laugh. For example, watch Millie tease Jimmy Fallon while playing a game about lying. The goal here isn't to fake laugh, it's to focus on teases that are playful, lighthearted, and genuinely make you laugh. Setting a playful tone early is crucial for these. If you don't, you can accidentally come off as rude. For example, watch earlier on that same Hot Ones episode when Millie's co-star Noah surprises her on the show. First, notice that her lower energy makes it seem like she isn't excited to see Noah. She doesn't smile when he comes in, her tone is cold, and she doesn't look at him when he's speaking. Because she doesn't seem excited to see him, the tease in this next clip is more likely to be perceived as hurtful, even though she laughs through it. So while softening your tease with a laugh is a great habit, don't underestimate the importance of setting a playful positive vibe beforehand. If this was the only interaction you saw between Noah and Millie, you might wonder why Noah considers Millie his best friend. A big part of that is likely due to our third tip from today's video, mixing in compliments with your teases. This makes you less predictable than if your only way of interacting with someone is by giving them a hard time, and it makes people way more likely to laugh at your jokes than get offended. Here are a few quick examples. With this context in mind, it's much easier to understand why Noah would love Millie. If you playfully tease people and get seen as rude, then this may be the part you're missing. When you tease someone, they don't just react to what's happening in the moment, they react to your overall relationship. This is why you and someone else can say the exact same thing but they may get a big laugh and you may get a dirty look. If you really want to charm the people around you, pair your compliments with a warm platonic touch. These brief moments of touch help build feelings of trust and connection. Okay, now let's get into a few habits that will help specifically when you're meeting new people. Some people struggle with early conversation when it isn't obvious what you can connect on. What if you can't tell immediately what you have in common with the other person? Millie was in a particularly weird spot as an early teen celebrity, a lot of her life was unrelatable to most people. For example, in this next clip with Stephen Colbert, he asks a young Millie about a photo of her crying on the last day of Stranger Things season 3. Her response may rub people the wrong way, especially because of the tone she uses. Being sad that your caterers are gone is a hard thing for most people to connect with in conversation. But here's what you may not realize, you don't have to have the same lifestyle and interests to connect with someone. To bond with anyone, just talk about yourself in a way that makes your life relatable to theirs. Here's an example of Millie doing it well. She's asked what it's like to be so heavily scrutinized at a young age and she does a great job of relating it to what any other teen can go through. For example, let's say you have a hobby that most people don't share. In honor of Stranger Things, we'll use D&D as an example. If you meet someone new who asks you what you do for fun and all you say is, I love playing D&D, you will only connect with them if they also love playing D&D. Compare that to something like, I love playing D&D, I have a weekly game with my friends, and it's a great way to make sure we all hang out at least once a week. Plus, I've always loved fantasy, so it's fun to co-create the stories I loved growing up. Now, even if they don't like D&D, they can relate to the fun of doing something with their friends or having something they love from their childhood. This leads into the next habit as well, which is hands down one of the most important habits if you want to make conversation with a new person flow more naturally. See if you can guess what it is from this next clip. You can make conversation easy for the other person by giving expansive answers. This doesn't have to be a super long monologue. Simply try to talk for 10 seconds longer than you normally would. Watch another example here. And then she launches into a quick story from there. Imagine if she just said, I flew in from LA. Suddenly, the pressure is back on Jimmy to make the conversation flow. Especially when you're first meeting someone, conversation can feel stilted or forced. When you answer small talk questions with short answers, you contribute to that forced feeling, because the other person has to work harder to come up with an interesting reply. The flip side of this is you don't want to dominate the whole conversation by doing all the talking. You also want to turn the conversation back on the other person. Millie does this even in situations where the spotlight is meant to be on her, like in interviews. Making sure the other person gets to chime in helps make them feel valued. Similarly, if you're in a group conversation, you can answer a question and then pivot to ask the same question to someone in the group who hasn't spoken much. Once you do get someone talking, focus on being a likable listener. It can be very powerful to make someone like you while they are the one speaking. This point may surprise some of you since as a child, Millie got a rep for being a bad listener. She would cut people off in conversation or zone out while someone else was speaking. But she's come a long way. Now, she has three great traits you can steal as a listener that will make people really enjoy speaking with you. First, you want to give someone your full focus. Nothing feels worse than talking to someone only to have them look around like they're searching for something more interesting. Watch how intently Millie listens to Noah here, shifting her entire body as he begins to speak. Another way to make people feel good when you're listening is with a big laugh. If you're funny or interesting, people will like you. But they'll like you even more if you combine that with making them feel like they are funny or interesting too. Again, the goal is not to be fake, but to freely express it when you do feel it. Here's a quick example. And again, you can see how this makes it so easy for her to tease Noah and it seemed good-natured. The last tip we'll touch on for being a likeable listener. If you do want to chime in on what someone else is saying, use the agree and expand technique. This makes them feel heard. Instead of cutting them off and steamrolling what they built, you're adding to it. The agree and expand technique is also a great way to handle when someone cuts you off. Agree with them so they feel heard, then retake the conversational reins so you can finish your thought. Now there's a lot going on in this video and you may be wondering how the heck do you actually remember all of this when you're out meeting new people. Especially if you're speaking with someone who makes you nervous. It's hard to remember to put all this into practice. That's why we put together our program Charisma University. It's a step-by-step 30-day program that tells you exactly what to do every day to take what you're learning and turn it into an unthinking habit. So by the end of 30 days, you radiate confidence and charisma naturally without even thinking about it. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. I had confidence in some areas but not in others. Then Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. Another member wrote, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. In conversations, I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think. I feel much happier all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman I've had a crush on for about a year and made a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep going back to it when I need a refresher on the daily action modules. And lastly, one member wrote, Thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma University, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values and I know who I am. The program is literally guaranteed to change your life. That means you can take the entire course and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund from right inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, you'll learn eight habits that make people love being around you, with examples from a celebrity that seems almost universally loved, Pedro Pascal. The first trait that makes Pedro so popular is his endearing embarrassment. When most people get accused of something embarrassing, they react with awkward silence or try to deny it. They don't realize this is actually an opportunity to make people like you more. Here's how to do it. Do you ever look at Instagram accounts devoted to you being a heartthrob when you're feeling down? Yes, I do. It really is that simple. You can turn embarrassing moments into charismatic ones just by laughing at yourself. Plus, if you laugh at yourself first, you save the people around you from feeling awkward by inviting them to laugh with you. Here's a great example where Pedro can't think of anything to say. When he laughs at himself, it saves the awkward silence and gets his co-star to laugh. You just saw another charismatic habit you can do to make people enjoy being around you. Play laugh tag. Add a touch when you laugh. Research shows that a welcome touch builds trust and connection, and conversational high points like when you're both laughing are a great time for it. One danger here, not everyone likes being touched, so you want to calibrate your touch to how well you know the person and if they touch back. A good way to start is with a simple hand on the forearm. Here's an example with Pedro where he purposely ruins a take and then teases his director Neil with a line the director used to say to him. Did you notice how Neil initially looks a little aggravated at Pedro's joke, but when Pedro laughs and touches his forearm, Neil smiles. The forearm touch is great for people you don't know well. With someone you already know and are building a closer connection with, you can also use Pedro's favorite laugh tag, the head on shoulder. Now let's go into a super easy habit if you want to make other people laugh. See if you can guess what it is from this next clip. Pedro could have just said, we get along really well, but instead he speaks in hyperbole. Exaggeration makes people laugh, especially when you exaggerate so much it's impossible to take you seriously. In this next clip, Bella and Pedro are asked how much of themselves they put into their characters in The Last of Us. Listen to how Pedro compares himself to the almost superhuman character he plays. You saw there how easy this is to do. It only takes five words for Pedro to get the whole group laughing. This bleeds into another joke Pedro loves that you can also steal, the fake narcissist joke. We all know people with annoyingly big egos. Pretending to be that person for one sentence is a great way to get a laugh. For example, listen to Pedro chime in after Poppy Delevingne shares her reaction to getting cast in Kingsman 2. Again, the key here is to go so over the top it's obvious that you're joking. Here's a great example with Robert Downey Jr. You'll get an even bigger laugh with these fake narcissist jokes if you've already established yourself in conversation as a kind, humble person. The easiest way to do this is to raise others up. Pedro has two ways of doing this that are super easy to do and will make people love being around you. The first is something that most people will say is obvious and yet most people don't do. If you find yourself thinking something nice about the person you're talking to, say it out loud. Beyond vocalizing kind thoughts, you can also raise people up simply by passing the conversational spotlight. It can be as simple as bouncing back the question people ask you. This is so easy to do and yet so many people don't do it. If you're already good at this, then you may have the opposite problem, giving up the conversational spotlight too quickly and too often. Laughing and making other people laugh, being kind and being a likable listener, these are all great traits that will make people enjoy being around you. But they won't feel a real connection with you until they learn at least a little bit about who you are. When it comes to sharing about yourself, a great trick is to use a hook that builds curiosity. Think of a common question that people typically ask you. Then think of a hook you can add to the beginning of your answer. If you aren't sure how to hook people, there are two specific hooks you can steal from Pedro. The first is the surprise positive twist. Follow up a seemingly negative sentence with a positive one. Other examples of this would be sentences like, I got laid off, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Or, my girlfriend told me it was the best day of my life. Then there's the second hook you can steal from Pedro. The I don't know if I should share this hook. When it comes to sharing about yourself, there's another great habit you can learn from Pedro. Have a few good go-to stories that you know people love. For example, Pedro loves to share the story of telling his family about The Last of Us. And I was on speaker, and I didn't even know that they were in the car. And I was like, I'm having a conversation about this amazing job. And she's like, what's going on? And I said, well, there's this job offer, and it's based actually on a video game. And she's like, yeah. And I said, it's called the, and I didn't even get the, I didn't even get to the A-S-T. And I was like, it's called the, and they're, The Last of Us! The Last of Us! You have to do it! You have to do it! You have to get this job! You better get that job! The next time you tell a story that gets a great reaction, make a mental note to yourself. By having stories you know people like, you instantly make yourself more fun to talk to than the majority of people out there. Just be mindful you don't use the same story over and over with the same audience. Now, if you've made it this far into the video, you probably want to make a stronger, more positive impression on people and create better relationships. Whether you want that for your career, social life, or romantic life, we have a step-by-step 30-day program that can help you do just that. Over 15,000 people just like you have gone through it and had life-changing results. Promotions, new jobs, a better dating life, more friends, and perhaps most importantly, a higher sense of freedom, confidence, and happiness. Now, it is a paid program, so to offset any financial risk to you, we've given the program a 60-day money-back guarantee. That means you have enough time to take the entire program, go through every single day, put it all into practice, and still have plenty of time to decide if you liked it or if you want your money back. We set it up this way because we know that once you experience the program, it'll change your life and you'll think it's some of the best money you've ever invested in yourself.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We all want to be liked and respected while being our unfiltered selves and one of the fastest ways to make people like you is to make them laugh. That's why in this video, we're going to talk about Andrew Schultz, a comedian who's popular for his ability to make people laugh even while he's making fun of them. Here's a quick example. Watch the reaction of the guy he's teasing. You're not gonna... How old are you guys? I'm 28. She just turned 18 yesterday. Just turned 18 yesterday. Let me... Everybody stop. Let me help you... Let me help you answer that f***ing question again, okay? Do not ever say just turned 18 again in your life. You're not the f***ing Brazzers title that you just gave me for her. Schultz's popularity is most impressive because he isn't a people pleaser. He leans heavily into jokes that most people wouldn't consider PC, yet his videos are well-received even in today's era of cancel culture. Today, we'll go through five tactics that will let you joke around unfiltered. The goal isn't to make all of your jokes roasts. It's to give you the mental freedom to share whatever funny thoughts come to mind knowing people will laugh instead of being upset. Also, quick warning for this video. We're talking about a comedian whose jokes are potentially offensive, but if you stick through to the end, you'll see there's a lot to be learned from him. Now, if you want to joke about people, you have to establish it's all in good fun. One easy way to do that is to start by joking about people you obviously like. For instance, here Schultz is roasting two of his friends for their stances on masks. As you can see, Brendan is very anti-mask, which is shocking me because if he gets the Chinese flu, this will be the second big country to knock him out. Now, on the other side, my buddy Neil Brennan, who looks like an injured bird, is adamant about wearing a mask. And I get that too. Let's be honest. If Neil gets it, he's gonna die. Look at him. He's got the immune system of the Dallas Buyers Club. Now, if Schultz makes a joke about you or one of your beliefs, you know he doesn't have ill intent. He's established that he teases his friends. The risk here is, how do you make sure your friends also know it's all in good fun? The easiest way is to tease yourself. For example, here Schultz talking about how any profiteering off the George Floyd riots is a form of looting. Notice how he insults himself. Also, if you're a news outlet that hand selects clips to fit your network's biased narrative, you're looting. And if you're a handsome comedian with a great smile and ears like Dobby, and you're talking about this event, that's not looting. I just can't get on stage because Chinese people keep beating bats. Some people may feel that bat joke isn't nice, but imagine you're in person with him and you've just laughed at his friend's MMA loss, his other friend's skinny frame, and his big ears. It makes it easier to laugh at yourself instead of being upset. If you're the butt of all of your jokes, you can come off as insecure. But when you mix it in while teasing other people, it softens your other teases and it shows confidence. Another thing that will help you get laughs is answering some questions with purposefully absurd answers. For example, in his recent Joe Rogan appearance, Joe asks if a murderer could be so attractive that you'd still sleep with her. Watch how Schultz takes a potentially genuine question and makes his answer so absurd that you have to know he's joking. This isn't to say you want to answer every single question with a joke, but by making your conversations a mix of genuine answers and absurd funny answers, you do two things. First, you make it more fun to have a conversation with you. And second, you establish that not everything you say should be taken at face value. This will help later when we get into edgier jokes. There's another trick that helps Schultz roast people and get a laugh. He'll mix compliments in while teasing you. For example, watch Schultz talk to an audience member about being Palestinian in Australia. Do y'all got a lot of Palestinians out here? No, it's just me. It's just because you ate the rest of them. Look how big you are. Holy shit, dude. They need you on the front lines, dog. You could throw a rock like 100 miles per hour. So he's already started to mix a compliment about how big and strong this guy is with a potentially insensitive joke about Palestinians throwing rocks. When the guy laughs, Schultz sees the green light to keep going, again, mixing kindness in with his potentially offensive joke. I don't want to bug you, man. You got to use the bathroom, buddy. Go for it, man. Oh, you're just getting a drink? Is that allowed in that culture? You're just getting a Coke Zero? Oh, does the zero stand for the amount of freedom that you guys have? Whose side am I on, guys? Whose side am I on? I got you. Get whatever he gets on me. Nice without funny can be boring. Funny without nice can come off like a jerk. By mixing compliments and teases together, you can make people laugh at themselves and feel good. You can see from his reaction that the guy loved it. There's another important thing to note. If you're going to joke about edgier topics that aren't considered PC, don't stereotype in a way that puts people down. For example, take a look at this improvised bit where he's trying to guess what country in the Middle East this audience member is from. His only clue is it's a country without oil. Israeli? Oh, they don't have any oil. Dude, you know how pissed off they got to be about that sh**? That's the one bad investment Jews have made. We'll take this land right here. This is good. This is fine. Trust me, this got the ocean view, everything you need. Why would you want to be inland? What is inland? Nothing important over there. 50 years later, like, maybe we should expand a little. Maybe... look. I'm Jewish and at least to me, unless you're particularly sensitive to accents, there's nothing inherently offensive in those stereotypes. He hasn't said Jews are less than or worse in any way. Here's another example, this time talking to an albino man in the audience. Are you white or black? You're black? Oh, sh**, bro. This is lit. Say the N-word and prove it. Bro, that's hilarious because this Mexican right next to you said the N-word a thousand times in his life. Come on, bro, say that sh**. You got it. Again, the joke touches on race, but unless you find accents offensive, no part of that is anti-black or anti-Mexican. Here's one more example and I'm going to start it with the audience member speaking so you can see that Schultz is imitating his accent specifically and not saying everyone in that group speaks like this. Oh, really? You must have came out the p***y crying, bro. Get this off of me! I don't want nothing to do with this! Yuck! Yuck! Ew! Ew! Why couldn't you just c-section me, b****? It might seem racy to make a gay joke in today's PC climate, but Schultz didn't say anything negative about gay people. I'll include links to all of these videos down below so you can see that in each instance, the person being joked about laughs along and isn't offended. That's the key regardless of what you're teasing someone about. You want to make sure they're able to laugh with you. So don't make the joke about how they're less than. Also, it's important to note setting and context. This isn't a random stranger. It's someone at a comedy show. So don't necessarily make jokes like these at work. The last area we'll touch on will be politics. Many comedians fall into a trap of only joking about one side, effectively making everyone on the other side dislike them. Most people are guilty of this as well. Instead, Schultz roasts all political parties. By teasing everybody, he makes it clear that this isn't about a group being superior. He's just making people laugh and pointing out the general absurdity in politics. For example, here he is talking about Joe Biden. He's the ideal candidate, not only for a clinical trial for dementia, but also to be the leader of the free world. Now, I know what you're thinking. How can he stop Trump if he can't stop wetting the bed? I'll tell you how. And here he is talking about why Tekashi 6ix9ine should run for president. I know exactly what he should do next. Run for president. Now, I know you're thinking, how could he be president with all that stupid shit on his face or that dumb hair or lack of political experience? He's a fraud. He wasn't even part of that gang. He just used them to sell an image to the public to gain power. Not so crazy now, is it? If you don't care about American politics, then this is likely to make you laugh and not offend you. If you do care about American politics, you likely agree that at least one of these candidates isn't fit to be president. So you probably liked at least one of those jokes. In general, once you make someone laugh at something they agree with, you'll find it easier to get them to laugh at themselves. Now, it's worth repeating, the goal isn't just to roast people all the time. These tools are meant to empower you to drop your filter and have more confidence to share your thoughts knowing you can do so in a way that will make people laugh. It's also worth noting, Schultz may pretend to be a jerk with his comedy, but his actions show him to be a kind person. When a man showed up to his show in a wheelchair, he personally helped carry him down the stairs. When a woman had a seizure at his show, the audience stayed in their seats, but he went to make sure she was okay. Schultz shares that last story very well here and it illustrates today's emphasis on policing speech versus taking action. She had a seizure at the show. We checked on her. She was fine. She leaves. Everything's good. So I started to make fun of what happened in the situation and a girl in the crowd stood up. She's like, you can't make jokes about that. That's not funny. And I asked what she did for a living. She said she was an EMT. And I was like, why didn't you help? And you know why she didn't help is because this is what we do now. We complain, but we don't help because we think that's enough. Charlie and I had been planning another Charity Water fundraiser and this seems like a great point to tie it to. So in honor of Schultz's plea to actually help, we're donating $100,000 to Charity Water. This donation is only possible thanks to you. If you've watched our videos or joined Charisma University, you are a part of the Charity Water community. If you've watched our videos or joined Charisma University, you are the reason that we can help over 3,000 people gain access to clean water who wouldn't otherwise have it. Because of you, their lives will be changed forever. So thank you. If you feel inspired to help personally as well, just $30 gives someone access to clean water for 10 years. That's life-changing. And even a $1 donation makes a difference. It might not seem like much, but you help fund the cause and you show these communities that there are people who care about them. So if you're feeling inspired by Schultz or us or the people you'd be helping, please consider donating. I'll put a link up now on screen and in the description below.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"I've covered a lot of different traits of attractive men on this channel. You've got playful teasing... I have a gluten allergy, so I can't really eat... You have a gluten allergy? That's so unusual to hear from an actress. No, it's for real! High conviction... Why are you shaking? Am I? Yeah. Nobody's shaking. And, of course, strong body language. So the next time you go stomping around like a four-year-old throwing tantrums with me, I'll be the one getting rid of you. All of those work for attracting women, but today, I want to touch on a deeper principle that I have never mentioned. This one is not nearly as obvious as those others, but it is a trait that women pick up on and respond to incredibly powerfully, and it is called grounded masculinity. It is that quiet aura that men who know how to engage with the feminine radiate effortlessly. Okay, so let's dive into a concrete example. This moment from the show Survivor. In it, a woman named Eva is competing in a challenge. If she loses, someone on her team is getting kicked out, and she is having a hard time. Just when it looks like she's about to throw the challenge, she comes through, though, and she wins for her team. Everyone is thrilled and jumps on her. What none of them know is that Eva has autism, so her emotions can more easily become overwhelming to her. So everyone thinks that she's crying tears of joy, but actually, she's in distress. Only one guy who is on the other tribe sees that something is wrong. So even though you're normally not allowed to mix tribes after these challenges, the host gives him the green light to walk over and then this happens. Joe, who she'd connected with earlier in the show, knows exactly what to do. He contains, attunes to, and grounds her, and in a matter of minutes, she's back to feeling excellent. I'm good. I'm good. Thank you. Thank you. So I want to break down all three of these skills because they will help you tap into that grounded masculinity, attract women almost effortlessly, and, if you already have someone that you're dating, will help in your relationship as well. So let's start with containment. Containment means providing safety for an emotional experience to exist. Now, this has two parts. The first part of any container is space. Holding space for someone means that you let them have their emotion. You don't jump in and immediately fix it or provide advice or say how the same thing happened to you once. You give the other person space to express what they're feeling without smothering them. And I broke this down in detail in the Theo Vaughn video but it's worth showing that incredible example just one time here. Watch how Theo's space holding impacts Sean's emotional expression. Yeah, I'm sorry, bud. I'm sorry, buddy. It's all good, dude. We don't have to talk, man. I can just sit here with you for a minute. Oh, f**k. The second aspect of containment though is the opposite of space — it's boundaries because you can't give infinite space for someone to have their emotional expression. For instance, you wouldn't let someone that you love call you out on a date because you don't want that to happen. For instance, you wouldn't let someone that you love call up their boss and curse them out just because they came home upset. So containment involves sensing when someone is no longer in a healthy expression of emotion but is looping in a way that is likely re-traumatizing them or doing serious damage to their relationships. In these cases, loving boundaries are placed on what you will support them doing and that can mean advising them to take a breath, physically holding them, or in some cases, saying something like, I love you but if you're going to continue with this course of action, I need to step out of the room. But how do you know whether more space for expression or firm boundaries are called for in any particular moment? Now, this is where the second pillar of grounded masculinity comes in and it is empathetic attunement. This is the ability to feel what other people are feeling without getting lost in those feelings. So one part of you is in their emotion with them but another part has a grasp on the bigger picture. For instance, in the Goodwill hunting scene, it is this skill of empathetic attunement that allows the therapist to listen to Will deeply. So yes, Will is literally saying, I'm okay. Get away from me. But with empathetic attunement, the therapist and you can respond to the deeper communication. In this case, it's, I need help but I'm afraid that I can't trust you. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. Don't fuck with me. It's not your fault. Don't fuck with me, all right? Don't fuck with me, Sean. Not you. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. Having this ability is a superpower and it will help you immensely in any romantic relationship and you can develop it in two ways. One that takes a while and one that you can use today. The one that takes a while lasts longer and it is giving yourself empathy. Literally, you feel your own feelings and that makes you better at supporting others. Theo Von, I think, was so effective with Sean because he had done his own work in therapy. I've just done a ton of yoga, meditation. I try the ketamine with a therapist in the room. But that obviously takes time. So if you want to boost your attunement skills today, try this. Mirror someone's physiology as you're listening to them. Smile with them. Cringe with them. Lean in or cross your arms as they do. From there, you can just label how you feel in their body language saying something like, wow, that sounds really exciting or scary, confusing, whatever. It sounds simple but it makes people feel like you feel them which is exactly what most women are seeking. And yes, it's a joke but this video of a woman with the nail on her head resonated for exactly this reason. It is not about the nail. Are you sure? Because, I mean, I'll bet if we got that out of there— Stop trying to fix it. No, I'm not trying to fix it. I'm just pointing out that maybe the nail is causing— You always do this. You always try to fix things when what I really need is for you to just listen. Now Joe doesn't mirror Ava's body language but he does pay incredibly close attention to her which is how he's able to attune and tell that things have gotten out of hand before anyone else catches on. So in those situations where you see that someone is out of control and needs support, the mature masculine will offer the feminine grounding. This means that you will find ways to bring them back to the concrete reality of now, to their feet on the ground, the breath in their belly, the safety of this moment. And that's because most emotional episodes have to do with past hurts or future anxieties. Right now is actually safe but the other person has just lost sight of that. That is exactly what is going on in this scene. Ava has won the challenge. She's safe now. Now, logical men can make a mistake here and try to point out all of the reasons that things aren't as bad as they may feel. This generally has a limited impact as you may have seen. So the most effective way to help someone, particularly someone who is feminine, return to a sense of safety is not with logic. It is by co-regulating your nervous systems. Now, this works because we can feel the emotional states of other people especially if we're physically close to them and you've lived this. I'm sure that there's been times where someone around you is really anxious and it started to rub off on you. Likewise, if you come into close contact with someone who's grounded in the now, you'll start to relax and that is exactly what happens with Joe and Ava. Okay. The best way to co-regulate with another person is to take a deep breath and focus on your own exhale. Let it last longer than usual, maybe six to eight seconds, and do it through your teeth so it'll sound like, This brings us to a fascinating point that most men do not really grasp. The feminine mode has a heightened awareness of and sensitivity to safety. In the masculine mode, we can often lose sight of this but most women spend a considerable amount of energy scanning for safety, both physical and emotional. They spend more energy on this than most men realize and for them, it becomes almost like a sixth sense that draws them to certain people and away from others. So how does a woman know who can be trusted with her safety? For instance, Ava told only one person about her autism fearing that people might use it against her in the game. So how did she immediately know that that person would be Joe? How did she know that he would respond like this? Now, we can point to obvious and important things. Joe is physically strong. He's a father, a firefighter who regularly puts other people before himself. All of those things are important and definitely factored into her decision but one essential piece that is so often missed and I believe is the next big evolution for men is that safe men, men who effortlessly attract feminine women, have integrated their own feminine aspects without being dominated by them. That means that to attract women in this way, you have to love and care for the feminine parts of yourself. That means offering yourself a safe place for emotional expression. Now, frankly, most men have not done this. Generally, we have very tight emotional limits that were placed on us by our culture when we were small so we meet our difficult emotions with an attempt to fix, change, or crush them almost never by expressing them in a safe place and that was definitely true for me up until just a few years ago but if you begin to enter into and work through your own emotional storms, you will know exactly what to do with someone else who is going through it. Fairly effortlessly, you will act in ways that make women and men feel deeply supported and grateful for your presence. Now, I would love to do more on these topics so let me know if that's of interest.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Ragnar Lothbrok is a legendary leader and main character in the show Vikings. In a time when power and respect meant everything, he was able to rise up from being a simple farmer, to a ruler, to a king. In this video, we'll break down five different ways Ragnar was able to command respect from everyone around him. You don't have to do them all, so you can pick the ones that you think fit you best and apply them to command respect like Ragnar. Ragnar! Ragnar! Quick warning, this video has spoilers through season four. The first thing that earns Ragnar respect is his ambition. Specifically, Ragnar has ambitious goals that other people want to be a part of, and he pursues them relentlessly. For example, when invading Paris, Ragnar comes up with a crazy plan to carry boats up a cliff to surprise the enemy. No Viking has ever tried this before. Notice in this clip how even rival kings praise him for this, specifically because it's such an ambitious plan. Ragnar Lothbrok, you're insane. Because this is beautiful. It's beautiful. We're honored to be here with you, doing the impossible. Most people fear failure. To protect their ego, they set small goals. Or, they talk a lot about having big goals, but do nothing to pursue them. If you want to stand out from the crowd and quickly earn respect from the people around you, then come up with an ambitious goal and start working to make it a reality. Ragnar does, and because of this, even his enemies respect him. You respect Ragnar Lothbrok? Why not? He is what I used to be — restless, ambitious. That's the power of pursuing ambitious dreams that other people want to be a part of. If you succeed, it shows you're capable of something few others are. And whether you succeed or not, it shows you have the confidence to bet on yourself. If you feel like you don't have the resources to pursue your dreams, then you're in good company. When Ragnar starts his rise to power, he's just a farmer. No one has to follow him unless they choose to. So when he suggests that men come with him to sail west to England, which no Viking has ever done, they aren't exactly jumping at the opportunity. We have to remember, though, that Errol Haraldsson has ordered us to sail east. He could kill us for disobeying his orders. Many people here would focus on themselves and emphasize how important their dream was to them. Instead, Ragnar speaks in you and we. Watch how he emphasizes that his goal will help everyone he's speaking to to achieve their greatest desires. We can offer you a chance to shine in battle and impress the gods and to bring back such plunder that you have never seen before. If you want people to follow your lead, then explain to them how following you helps them achieve their goals. By taking the verbal focus off of yourself, you end up getting more respect and more of what you want. For example, after Ragnar returns home as the first Viking to successfully raid England, he immediately wants to go back. But his ruler feels threatened by his success and doesn't want him to go. So watch how he gets what he wants. It must be true that there are many more such holy places in England and other lands to the west likewise filled with such treasure. And to sail there would benefit us all. You can see this in our world today. Many people right now hate the uber-wealthy and yet billionaire Elon Musk is incredibly respected. Why? While most billionaires are associated with greed, Elon has the same first two traits as Ragnar — giant ambitious dreams that he positions as good for all of mankind. One of the few times in Vikings when someone disrespects Ragnar's wishes is his own wife. She stays with him after he cheats but leaves after he talks to her like this. This woman is carrying my child. I must take care of her. When we lost our unborn son, it broke my heart. I had failed and I will not fail again. I cannot turn this woman away. He focused this speech completely on himself and she left him the very next day. If instead he had focused on her pain or her desires, he might have saved their marriage. So in your own life, whether you want to get respect from your bosses, coworkers, friends, or family, it's important to speak in we. Instead of talking about what you want, talk about how following you will get people what they want. Now everyone is a team and you just happen to be the leader they're following. The third thing Ragnar does that commands respect from everyone around him is project calm in the face of conflict. For instance, watch how he reacts when enemy soldiers threateningly approach his men during a dinner negotiation. I agree to the terms. Imagine you're his enemy. You have no idea how skilled his men are in battle, but that's his reaction when you threaten him. Terrifying. He's completely non-reactive and maintains slow movements and relaxed body language. His calm instantly commands respect. For another example, watch how he reacts when his brother, a legendary fighter, threatens to kill a man he wants to keep alive. When I say he dies, does it really mean that much to you, brother? Most people faced with social conflict break eye contact. This successfully diffuses tension but can make you seem weak. Others may try to show strength by raising their voice, but this can escalate the conflict. Ragnar holds eye contact and keeps his voice low. This is a great combination. Your eye contact conveys confidence while speaking calmly and at a low volume helps de-escalate the situation. This doesn't mean to put yourself in harm's way to get respect. Try to avoid physical conflict when you can, but if you find yourself in the face of social conflict, this is a great playbook to follow. This lack of fear helps Ragnar with another habit he has that commands respect. He leads from the front. If Ragnar asks someone to take a risk for him, he takes the risk as well. For example, in almost every fight, he's in the thick of things, often leaving the safety of the shield wall to win the battle. Even when other people volunteer to take risks for him, Ragnar makes sure he carries at least an equal burden. Watch what he does when his friend Floki volunteers to raid an enemy camp and burn their food supplies. A few of us will go into the town and destroy the winter grain stores. I will do it. I will go. No. My son and I shall go. We'll only need a few men. Compare that to the Parisian emperor that hides in his castle while his men die for him and then reacts like this when Ragnar sneaks into the city. I win. Yes. You could forgive him for his initial shock, but he stays there the entire battle, never getting up to help his men. They are violated. The parson's sitting. What is there to say? All the angels in heaven are weeping. Father, get up. The heathens have gone. You can tell even his own daughter no longer respects him. If you've ever had a boss that expects you to work long hours while he does nothing, you know how repulsive that can be. But if you have a boss who works those long hours with you, suddenly you're a team and you respect him for it. This applies even amongst friends. If you ask a friend to help you move and you make sure to do at least as much work as them, they'll be happy to help you. But if you ask a friend for help and then you slack off, they'll resent you for it. But Ragnar is not just a hardened warrior. The respect people have for him comes from his courage, but also from his compassion. Ragnar sees through other people's eyes. When making a decision involving someone else, he puts himself in that person's shoes. For example, listen to how the crowd initially reacts to this old man's request. But I also have a favor to ask, Lord. What is this favor? That the next time you go raiding, you take me with you. They laugh at him, but Ragnar does not. He gives the old man a chance to explain himself. All the friends and companions of my youth are dead. And feasting and drinking with the Aesir in the halls of the gods. I beg you, Lord. Gift me the chance to die with honor in battle and join my friends in Valhalla. He's an old man and might be a liability in battle. No one there would object if Ragnar rejected him. But watch the reaction when Ragnar gives him his wish. This summer, we shall have more ships to go west. For that is our future. When we return to England, let's take him with us. All in favor? Aye! Making a decision that carries risks for you but helps someone else is a great way to quickly get respect from the people around you. Ragnar's wife takes this to the next level by applying it even to her enemies. My Lady Lagertha, I hope you can find it in your heart to speak to the wife of the late Earl. Of course. Please, sit down and join us. Wait. Earl Howlton tried to kill my father. I know. And if he had succeeded, I would be standing where Siggy's standing now. It was fairly common in Vikings for a cycle of murder and revenge to occur between families. By treating Siggy as if she was herself, Lagertha instead earns a friend and ally. In your own life, you probably follow the golden rule well with people you like and are close to. But the most respect is gained when you're in a position of power over strangers, competition, or people you don't like. In those moments, ask yourself, Even though this person is not someone I'm close to, what would I want them to do if our positions were reversed? When other people see you do that, they'll immediately respect you more. Now, a few of these are tricky to pull off if you don't have self-confidence. If confidence is something you struggle with or you just want to take yours to the next level, I recommend checking out our program, Charisma University. It's the fastest way I know to build your confidence and charisma and it's literally guaranteed to work in 30 days or you get your money back. You can read all about the details in the link below but I think the best way to let you know what this course is about is to let the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written us in email or the course comments. The first one comes from a guy promoted to a senior position early in his career and he says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills, which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. Now this next one comes from another person who started a new job saying, I wanted to let you know that I nailed those first few days at work. Everything that I needed was right there at the moment, the confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset and with all your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it just could not go wrong. And he finishes by saying, I just wanted to emphasize that what I did the previous days would not have come to mind if I had not discovered that charisma is a skill that can be learned thanks to your YouTube channel and university program. And this last one is a comment in the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their social life. And he says, life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. And there are many more success stories like that in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. And it's 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because I want to make sure that every single person truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course. Otherwise, you can just refund. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the descriptions. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it. I hope you decide to join if this is an area of your life that you're looking to improve. And either way, thank you for watching this video and I will see you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 704}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"First one, it has to do with where you put your attention when you're out in public. You're talking to someone and maybe for whatever reason you'd like to explore, you want to talk to another person. The worst thing that you could do in that situation is start to scan the room because you're not making that interaction interesting and fun. It is incredibly hard to get other people to join you when you don't look engaged yourself. When you're in conversation, be in it. The most interesting point in the whole room is right in between you two. Second thing also has to do with attention and it's to not let someone interrupt you while someone else is talking to you. I did this. I was on the flip side of this. I came in to talk to one friend and he just ignored me. At first, I was a little bit miffed. I was like, what is he doing? And a minute or two later, he said, hey, sorry, you had said something. What was that? And then he put his attention completely on me. I respected him in that moment. Even that I didn't totally like it, the fact that he was so centered as to focus on where he was was worthwhile. Of course, there's times where you don't want to do this. If you're in a big group, conversation flows freely. You don't have to ignore everybody else. One other time you don't want to do this is when you're in a group of people and someone new enters. It's actually good to pause the conversation. Be the one that incorporates them and then get things back on track. Third thing, trapping is the idea that you could be somewhere. Maybe you're on a booth. Maybe someone is against a wall. If you don't know them and you kind of close them in, it feels very uncomfortable. The flip side of this, though, if you're out at a bar, lean against the bar when you're talking to someone. It makes that person feel at ease and it makes everyone else in the room think those people probably know each other fairly well. If that other person wanders off, that's someone that I can comfortably talk to. This takes us to the fourth thing. When you communicate shame, it's generally not a powerful thing, especially if what you did was not a big deal. This actually happened to my brother. It's something that happens all the time. People got our names mixed up. This person called him by my name and afterwards went, oh, sorry, sorry. The weird thing is literally today, someone else did the same thing, but went, oh, no, you're Henry, you're Charlie, sorry. But it was this sense that nothing had happened that was wrong. So if you've made a mistake, particularly a social one that wasn't on purpose, do not hang your head. That's just going to communicate that this mistake is more grievous than it actually is. The last thing that we're going to be touching on, the eyebrow flash. And what it means is that you generally know this person and like this person. Say you're seeing a friend that you know, hey, what's going on? And those eyebrows lift. If you try to do this, like I have been for the last 30 minutes in the mirror, you're going to be a weirdo. I cannot recommend putting this one on purposely, so don't.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 157}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"The first social mistake we'll cover today is bully banter, putting someone down to make the rest of the group laugh, like this clip. This mistake confuses people because playful teasing can be a great way to make people like you, but the key is to make everyone laugh, including the person you're teasing. So how can you tease someone playfully without accidentally hurting their feelings and making them dislike you? Especially with people you aren't close to, don't tease something they're likely to be insecure about. I don't think this is obvious, but it's surprisingly common. Some people love dark humor, and with those friends, nothing has to be off-limits. But if you're trying to have a laugh with someone you don't know well, tease them about things they're unlikely to be insecure about. Things that will almost always go well are ones that highlight the person's strengths, are obviously untrue, or both. The next bad habit to avoid is mocking someone's mistakes. Here's an example of what that might look like with the Scream Queens cast reacting to iconic movie screams. This seems obvious, so why do people do this? Sometimes they're just thinking out loud and don't realize they're being hurtful, but often it's because they want to show off their own intelligence. People mistakenly think this makes them look smart, but often it just makes the person dislike you. And it makes you a target in the future. The next time you make a mistake, you can bet that person will jump on it and shame you like you've done to them in the past. The next mistake you might make without realizing it is the Negative Nancy. Specifically, being negative about things you know the other person likes. You want to be honest in conversation, it's good to not blindly agree with everything the other person says, but if you're consistently negative about the things that someone likes, it can create the feeling in them that you two won't get along. The worst time to do this is when you're first meeting someone. So how can you be your honest, authentic self and still connect? By connecting one layer deeper on shared values. So one possible response would be, oh that's interesting, I don't think I'd like Vegas, but I've never been. Why do you like it? Then you can look for values to connect on from their answer. If they say they like it because it lets them get away from the stress of everyday life and focus on having fun for a few days, you can say you love doing that too. But for you, that's a camping trip. Asking why and bonding over shared values can create a great back and forth conversation. Once you do have conversation flowing, make sure you avoid disrespectful distractions. This is when you accidentally disrespect someone by getting distracted while they're opening up to you. You might think you would never do this, but there is a version of this that almost everyone is guilty of these days. This is one we all do. Phone addiction is real and most of us suffer from it to some degree. You might think this is a minor thing, but looking at your phone when someone's talking to you can instantly kill a potential new relationship. If you're talking to someone, tune in and give them your full attention. If you're struggling because you're bored, don't zone out or disrespect them by looking at your phone. Instead, pivot the conversation to something you're genuinely interested in. If you want to learn more about how to do that smoothly, we'll link to a video on that topic at the end of this video. Another common mistake that can make someone feel disrespected is repeatedly talking over someone. The majority of the time when you do this, you aren't trying to be rude, you're just excited about what you have to say. Cutting someone off once because you're excited isn't a big deal, but if you make a habit of it and start to see body language like Joe Rogan's in these next two clips, that's a sign you need to make a real effort to stop interrupting. Before we get into today's last charisma mistake, I want to highlight that these are 15 second clips that do not represent the entire person. We are not saying these people are dislikable or uncharismatic at all. These are simply moments in time that we can learn from. One conversation with a lot of teachable moments happens to be the Full Send podcast featuring Andrew Schultz. At the time, it was obvious to everyone involved that things were not going well. We've covered a few things from this conversation already, but there's one more lesson we can learn from it. Andrew explains it well in this next clip. This is extremely common. You want someone to like you, so you try to look good. You lie or hide what you consider the bad stuff about yourself. You try to embellish or draw attention to the things that you think the other person will like. Ironically, trying hard to look good is what makes you look bad, because people can sense inauthenticity. In this conversation, Stiney is trying to bounce back and forth between saying he's being authentic and saying he's playing a character, trying to see which one will get Schultz to like him. This habit can be so deeply ingrained that you struggle to be fully open and authentic even when you want to be. This mistake confuses a lot of people. After all, we all want to be ourselves and be authentic, but you might also want better outcomes in life, whether that's better relationships, more career success, or just to feel more confident. So what can you do if you want to be your authentic self, but the way you've been doing it so far isn't getting you the life you dream about? One way is to focus on building charismatic habits so you can present your best self without thinking about it. For some people, this requires a quick mental reframe. Who you are isn't your bad body language or your poor delivery. You are the person underneath that who most people don't even get a chance to meet if you don't happen to luck into having good social habits. Another way to improve your charisma without being fake is to focus on building deep inner confidence. When you take your confidence to the next level, you'll naturally be more charismatic without trying.

It's a step-by-step guided program that comes with a daily action guide so you know exactly what to do each day to take what you're learning and turn it into a habit you do effortlessly.

Was that an earthquake or did you just rock my world? Can I get your number? Oh Heck yeah, he's already going for his phone cuz he's got nothing else to say other than that one So this is actually a teachable moment. The number is just a symptom of a good conversation instead of like Something you're hunting down For sure. No, that's a good. That's a good piece of advice, which is Don't ask for someone's number ask if they would like to do something with you, right? Would you like to get coffee? Would you like to go dancing sometime? Would you like to do XYZ? Awesome. If they say yes, great. Give me your number I'll let you know when's a good time and the number becomes not the main goal But just the facilitating thing to seeing someone again, so Teachable moment.

I don't know. He's in on that's fine. That's fine And he's not rushed I think a lot of these have been really rushed and he's a bit more comfortable with the the space Yeah, I Actually don't know. Okay. Oh, but I mean I want to yeah, what's your name? It's a great tree And Worth saying I feel like a lot of people's nervousness is betrayed in their eyes you know that they got the darting eyes when they're speaking to someone that they never spoken to before and When you can have sunglasses and it just nobody can detect that and they can see that rock-solid Cool guy look it helps. He's well-dressed. What do you think of my attire? It's pretty good. Cool shirt. Yeah I look like a or what? Yeah Sure, I'm gonna be honest. I don't have a pickup line.

I'll grab it quick and Ray Okay, again, this is a he's making a YouTube video So I don't I don't actually think he's trying to go on a date with this girl But this is a symptom of of thinking that the number is the entire point of the interaction Which is she's like a little bit of comforter. I'm gonna leave He's like, no, no, no, like definitely. Let's get number. She's like, I'll give you my number never speak to you And so if you do find yourself in this kind of a circumstance where you have had the guts to go up and speak to Someone and you're talking What are you up to today the very basics of like what brings them to whatever place that they are currently at, you know? And and as lame as it sounds what year are you is totally fine in college like just getting to know you logistical questions Then what do you like to do and you can find if there's something that you know You like I used to ask people if they liked salsa dancing Almost every time the answer to salsa dancing was I've never done it, but I really want to great They have a lesson this Monday night at 7 p.m. Over here if you're interested I sometimes go and I would love to go with you.

It can be a college campus As opposed to an open I guess it's not an open circle Which is a city or a nightclub or something like that in a city You can do that a hundred times in a college campus if you do that ten times you might get a reputation for being A creep.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"You probably know that your body language says a lot about you but what you might not know is exactly what it is saying all the time and that's why, in this video, I thought it'd be fun to cover seven things that your body language is likely, at some point, telling other people or, at the very least, that you can read in others. Now some of these, you're not going to want to mess with — they're happening subconsciously but other ones, if you do a simple tweak, you can come across as more confident and more likable which is absolutely worthwhile. The first one is one of those and it has to do with where you put your attention when you're out in public. Now, at networking events, you're out at a bar, you're talking to someone and maybe, for whatever reason, you'd like to explore, you want to talk to another person. Weirdly enough, the worst thing that you could do in that situation is start to scan the room because if you're in conversation with someone, you're scanning, other people have their peripheral vision going on and when they see someone that isn't interested and intrigued in the conversation they're having, they don't think, oh, the person they're talking to is boring, they think, oh, that person is boring — they're both boring because you're not making that interaction interesting and fun. It is incredibly hard to get other people to join you when you don't look engaged yourself so paradoxically, if you want to look like the person that other people want to get to know when you're in conversation, be in it. The most interesting point in the whole room is right in between you two. If you want to go out and explore, totally, totally cool but make sure that you keep your attention focused on the person you're talking to makes other people approach you, makes it easier to rope them into conversation other than looking around and if you absolutely have to look around the room, you can just peer over the person's shoulder but none of this — not gonna help. Second thing also has to do with attention but it's for groups that you know a little bit better and I realized this because I had a friend who did this really well and it's to not let someone interrupt you while someone else is talking to you. Now, I did this — I was on the flip side of this. We were all hanging out — me, my buddy, and another buddy. I was on the periphery but we'd all said hello to each other. They were having a conversation, I came in to talk to one friend, and he just ignored me. And at first, I was a little bit miffed — I was like, what is he doing? But after the conversation they were having, I kind of just stood there quietly, tried to join in, and a minute or two later said, hey, sorry, you had said something, what was that? And then he put his attention completely on me. And what I realized in that moment was two things. One, every time that I had his attention, even before that, I always felt like he was doing something really right and that's that he was focused on me but even when I was a person who was miffed, I respected him in that moment. Even if I didn't totally like it, the fact that he was so centered as to focus on where he was was worthwhile. Now, this is something that's worth incorporating. Of course, there's times where you don't want to do this. If you're in a big group, conversation flows freely, you don't have to ignore everybody else but particularly when someone's shy or quiet, to give them that attention really, really, really singles you out as the leader. One other time you don't want to do this is when you're in a group of people and someone new enters. Whenever someone new enters, it's actually good to pause the conversation, be the one that incorporates them, and then get things back on track. Very powerful leadership things to do. Third thing, this has to do with your body and what you lean against. Now, I've covered trapping in videos on flirting. Trapping is the idea that you could be somewhere, maybe you're on a booth, maybe someone is against a wall, and especially if you're a bigger presence than them, if you don't know them and you kind of close them in, it feels very uncomfortable. The flip side of this, though, is in any situation, you know the people not. When you're not in that group of people or someone is not in that group, they see you leaned against the wall, leaned against the bar, sitting in the chair while other people talk to you, it makes people that aren't even in that group think that you are the leader of that group. The person who is leaning, they become the center point. Everyone is on them, if that makes any sense. So this is not something that you're going to have to do often. You need to keep it in mind always but one situation where it's useful is when you're out at a bar, it's been a while since I've been there, but lean against the bar when you're talking to someone. It makes that person feel at ease and it makes everyone else in the room think, oh, those people, A, probably know each other fairly well, and B, if that other person wanders off, that's someone that I can comfortably talk to. So this takes us to the fourth thing which is your hands. This one is very basic. I see it done wrong though so I have to say it. Hands in pockets — they make you look nervous, they make you look like you're untrustworthy, it's just not worth doing. If your hands are cold or you absolutely don't know what to do with them and you have to, you can cross your arms. At least this looks like you're a little bit tough, I don't even know. It's not the best either but hands in pockets — really bad. So once you take your hands out, there's a number of things that you can do with them. Two broad categories to think about for the purpose of this video though. The first is precise gestures. That's going to be where your fingers come together. Maybe they come together like this, maybe they come together as you do. You've got to do this, and then this, and then this. These are precise gestures. Then there's expansive gestures. They have different things. Precision actually gets people to focus closely on what you are saying and it's really good if it matches your words. Expansive makes you come across as more confident, generous, likable, you're more open. This is true with every aspect of your body. Generally, the more expansive you are, up to a point, you don't need to invade other people's space totally. This is going to be very useful for you. If you want to come across as more confident. So that was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We're up to right now. Six has to do with shame. When you communicate shame to someone, it's generally not a powerful thing especially if what you did was not a big deal. Now this actually happened to my brother. He told me a story and I realized this happens all the time so it's worth covering. The shame is you hang your head in shame, right? And he told me that someone did this. It's something that happens all the time. People got our names mixed up so this person called him by my name and afterwards went, oh, sorry, sorry, and then looked back up. And in that moment, he felt, oh, man, I guess he did something pretty bad. The weird thing is literally today, someone else did the same thing but went, oh, no, you're Henry, you're Charlie, sorry, and smiled and said sorry just like he did but it was this sense that nothing had happened that was wrong. So if you've made a mistake, particularly a social one that wasn't on purpose, do not hang your head, right? That's just going to communicate that this mistake is more grievous than it actually is. Instead, make eye contact, smile, apologize. You can give him a little shoulder, hey, sorry about that. That's going to be much, much stronger and make it— it's going to, I don't want to say minimize, but well, it is going to minimize. What you did wasn't a big deal at least in the context of what we're talking about. If you've really messed up, go see one of our other videos on how to deal with a tough conversation. The last thing that we're going to be touching on, seven, do not try to do this one yourself. Don't try to override your subconscious beliefs. This is just one that is happening and I learned about it and I wanted to share it with you. It's the eyebrow flash. The eyebrow flash is when your eyebrows go up roughly for one-fifth of a second. And what it means when it happens is that you generally know this person and like this person. So if you think if you're meeting someone new for the first time, you might say, hey, how are you? Not a lot happening with your eyebrows, you could still smile. But say you're seeing a friend and you haven't seen him in a minute or just a friend that you know, hey, what's going on? Your voice goes up, the mouth sometimes gets a little bit wider, as opposed to the smile, right? And those eyebrows lift. Just an interesting thing. I wanted to include it because I thought it was cool. If you try to do this like I have been for the last 30 minutes in the mirror, you're going to be a weirdo. I cannot recommend putting this one on purposely so don't. So hopefully, that has been interesting. Those are the seven things that you might not realize that you're communicating with your body language. If you are interested in things that communicate confidence from a body language perspective, that communicate presence and magnetism when you go out, you might be interested in our course, Charisma University, which is actually week 5 is Presence and Magnetism where we dive deep into body language. Now, in that week and in the course, you're going to learn how to carry yourself so that people immediately respect you and, of course, what to do with your eyes, your hands, and body positioning so that you're exuding confidence. But most importantly, the entire course is set up with a step-by-step daily action guide and that is so that you can make great body language a habit without having to overthink it, come across as robotic. And that is huge because body language is notoriously hard to fix. A lot of what you do is happening unconsciously without really meaning to. So you might be able to pull off great body language for a moment but as soon as you stop actively thinking about it, you can go back to your old habits and that's why, in Charisma University, I lay everything out with a daily action guide. The point of that is that all you have to do is watch 20-minute videos each day, do the action guide, and body language plus charisma becomes an unthinking habit for you. The course is supposed to take all of the guesswork out of becoming more charismatic so that you know with certainty, as long as you're following the program, you're going to see amazing results. And if you're not into the course for whatever reason, there's a 60-day money-back guarantee. You hit the refund button, you get every single dime that you've invested back. We've had thousands of people go through the course at this point. They've gotten promotions, raises, new friends, dates, romantic encounters, all sorts of stuff so if you want to learn more about that and potentially join, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 556}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"A few weeks ago I did the worst interview of my entire life from a charisma perspective and I did it on the largest platform that I have ever been on. I did it in front of millions of people and I want to share with you what went wrong, what I think I could have done differently, and how you can hopefully avoid making the same mistakes that I did so that you don't screw it up like me. So I want to start with a photo. This is going to tip it off what interview it was. This is Diary of a CEO, this is Steven Bartlett, awesome dude, had a great time with him, his team is amazing. And after the interview they give me this incredible book that has all of these photos from the interview and unfortunately in all of them I'm making massive charisma mistakes. This photo right here I have three which I will detail but first I want to talk about how I wound up there making these egregious mistakes that I talk about and have talked about in almost all of my videos. So a month or two ago I'm reached out to by the Diary of a CEO team they want to set up an interview when Steven is in Los Angeles and I say yes I've seen their podcast I'm very excited to do it and they're so professional they do everything they can for me to make this interview a home run. We have a pre-interview call which is actually rather rare and they talk about the topics they want to cover, they ask me if there's things I want to do, they see if I want to do a live charisma breakdown which I say no to because it takes me a long time to do those, but we basically iron out the types of things we're going to be talking about and during this period I'm sharing what's going on with friends and they're telling me that I should probably prepare for this and I sort of agree and I sit down to try to prepare for it and every time that I do something in me gets fidgety. I'm like a kid who doesn't want to do his homework and so the week before I'm starting to review some of my old videos because I know there's going to be questions from the past in there but even that is just feeling uncomfortable and next thing I know I'm in the car driving over and we're in the studio. It's a 10 camera setup. It's the most professional thing I've ever been to. The team is incredibly friendly, incredibly inviting. Do you want a water? How can we make you comfortable? Stephen comes in, we hang out and chat for 15 minutes which is a great way to settle people down pre-interview for nerves and I'm actually feeling pretty comfortable during this entire interaction. I'm excited and then he goes, starts and asks the question that I've been asked legitimately hundreds of times. If you had to explain in your own words what it is that you're doing for those people in a simple way, what would you, how would you say that? And the answer to this is written on my homepage. I've said it hundreds of times. It's we help people turn on their charisma and confidence in the moments that matter the most. I know this like I know my own name, like I know my social security number and instead of saying that what I do is I just start yapping. I have no idea what I'm going to say but I'm just yapping in circles and I probably take no exaggeration not just on this question but in these introductory questions about 10 to 15 minutes of circuitously sorting through what I do, how many viewers we have, etc. Mercifully this is cut down tremendously in the final edit which is why the his team sort of saved me from this and it doesn't look like the worst interview I've ever done but it was abysmal. Had this been live television people would have definitely tuned out and been like why is this guy teaching charisma this is so uninteresting and confused and as I look back it's genuinely hard for me to watch the interview. It took weeks before I could do it. In fact, friends asked me how it went and I it's like it was a crash and burn situation but I just want to go to this photo and start to talk about the concrete mistakes that I made. So you can see here the three that I'm referring to. Our first one, crossed arms, forgivable, it happens at times. Second one which is utterly egregious on camera which is hands on face. This is something that I do and people do when they're nervous, right? We touch ourselves, we preen ourselves and I did that in almost every photo in here has me with a hand on my face but the big one, the one that I think led to a lot of this, was my very poor collapsed posture and so when you have poor posture, you see Stevens is quite nice here, it's tougher to take a deep breath, it's tougher to calm down and this sends you up into your head where you start thinking a lot and like I was yapping. I was not grounded in my body, I wasn't connected either to the thing that I'd done 300 times nor deeply to the present moment to be able to respond in a slow, powerful, coherent way and so eventually what happened is a week and a half later after I texted Steven and said hey did that go okay and he kindly assured me that he thought it would turn out great in the edit and he had a good time which I did too. There was a lot of moments in this interview that I felt very connected to Steven and there was some beautiful moments in there as well particularly at the end but the interview drops and it was two hours and ten minutes and we had shot for about three hours and 45 minutes so about an hour and a half got cut of this and it came out okay, it came out pretty good even. I hit the points that I've talked about in the past, there's moments of genuine connection between he and I which are on camera and captured so thank god for the 10 camera setup that allowed for such smooth editing between the pieces that I did wrong but like I said if this were live television it would have been a huge issue. So as I reflect now weeks later on what went wrong because it would have tanked were this an interview or a job process, I did not turn the charisma on command on. I'm trying to figure out why couldn't I follow my own advice, why couldn't I do big gestures, why couldn't I get my hand off my face, why couldn't I speak more clearly and confidently and most obviously have a clear answer to the questions I knew were coming. This is a core tenet of what I teach in the Charisma University course. Why did I feel like a child with homework to avoid beforehand and what I'm starting to realize is that I think that there are phases to learning anything. There's an old phrase that first you must learn the rules before you can break them and when I look at the last 10 or 15 years of Charisma on Command it is me learning the rules, it is me sharing with you the ideas and habits that I've been adding to myself. Move your hands like this, make eye contact like this, tell stories like this, even the things Stephen asked me at one point, what are the things that you should remove, the things that make people dislike you, these are things that I'm adding, these are ideas about things not to do so you're going into conversation with extra awareness, don't put your hands in your pockets, don't talk about this topic in this particular way and that's the first stage of I guess any sort of art is you're adding to yourself, you're emulating others and I do think that there needs to be and in fact I don't feel like there's a choice right now the way that my system reacted when I sat down there, a period of time where you stop adding to yourself and you allow yourself to let go, you subtract, you forget all the rules about what your hands should do and how you should tell the story and you drop into your gut and your heart and you just speak what is real in the moment and in my life with charisma, with every interaction that I'm having, this is what's going on for me and it is a very scary experience especially when the cameras are on because I feel ripped between the old way that I know works, that I have done to achieve so many things that I wanted to achieve, that I have taught other people, that I'm on the record as saying this is the way to do it as I've shared with you in so many videos in the past and there's a part of my system that just won't let me do it and if I try now I'm yapping, now I'm speaking from this confused spun-up heady place that is neither the old charismatic performative way of being nor is it this new grounded present way of being and so I guess what I wanted to do in this video is share with you that probably to come there's going to be things that sound contradictory to things that I've said in the past and I don't think that they are, I think that they're representative of different stages, the first stage being learn the art, learn the skills, learn the rules, and the second being let it go and be real, be you, be the charismatic person that you always are underneath all of the social conditioning and fear. So that's what happened, that was an incredibly anxious week of my life, it was also a week of deep gratitude for the anxiety that my job sometimes creates in me as I show up in new uncomfortable ways and then the weeks after the reactions that I got were so loving and kind and particularly as I mentioned before there was something that I shared at the end of the video that I've not talked about on the main channel that has to do with a significant struggle of my past that has shaped me and my coping mechanisms in many ways so I will say if you'd like to check out the interview and see all of the things I talked about including now with a greater eye a lot of the cuts in the beginning hopefully some of the more connected moments in the middle and that piece at the end I will put a link in the description here but between you and I it's okay to let go of the things that I've taught you in the past you don't have to come into every conversation and every interaction trying to improve and better yourself in fact I guess what I'm learning is that there is a time to just be so that's what I got for you today I appreciate you guys I'll see you in the next one\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 600}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"It's not your fault that you care what other people think, it's a natural instinct almost everyone has. And it feels justified, because if you truly don't care at all what people think, you risk becoming a social outcast. The problem is, if you care too much about what other people think, it will lead you to an anxious, mediocre life. There's also an internal cost when you live for other people's approval. You lose touch with your own natural confidence, energy, and joy for life. Now this video is not about becoming a narcissist and not caring at all about other people, so let's let Tony Robbins reframe our goal. The number one regret of people who are dying is I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me. So let's spend the rest of this video going through how you can do just that. One way to stop caring what other people think is to find your fire. You cannot care about everything at a 10 out of 10, so if you want to stop caring what people think, find something you care about more. The first thing to realize if you have people in your life telling you not to pursue your dreams is that you are not alone. If you have family or friends telling you not to live life the way you want to, here's an exercise you may find helpful. Visualize your ideal day. When do you wake up? Where do you wake up? What happens during your day? Create a clear vision of your ideal life. It's easy to deal with people judging your actions today if you know those actions are moving you closer to a future you're excited about. And always remember, someone's negative judgment might just be crabs-in-a-bucket syndrome. The second trick to stop worrying about what everyone thinks about you is to create an inner circle. Only care about the opinions of a select few chosen people you love and trust. This is how people like Bill Burr feel confident saying things they know some people won't like. This strategy sounds good, especially if you have a tight group of people you respect. But this inner circle strategy can trap you into that group's expectations and limit the ways you'll allow yourself to grow. It's a great first step, but not the end goal. The next level is to only give this power to yourself. And to do that, you need to decide your core values and commit to caring about them more than the opinions of other people. This can include things like growth, contribution, fun, freedom, or honesty. This next clip is an example of what it looks like to commit to honesty instead of trying to look perfect. The ironic thing is, because it's so rare to meet someone who isn't trying to fit in or impress you, when you do commit to your core values, it often makes people like you. Just look at the reaction Andrew Santino's honesty gets in this next clip. For context, Schultz is asking him what he thinks of Mr. Beast's cookies. One quick note, you don't have to be that harsh to commit to honesty as a personal value. If you like this idea of having core values, it helps to sit down and actually write what yours are. You can read them several times every day like a mantra. I value growth, honesty, kindness, and fun more than fitting in. Remember, other people will come and go from your life. The only person you have to live with every day is yourself. So those are three things you can care about more than the opinions of other people. Your future vision, your inner circle, and your core values. Now let's talk about some strategies to simply care less about what other people think without needing to replace it with something else. One way to worry less about the judgment of others is to leave the validation casino. Every time you try to get external validation, you train your brain to care what other people think. Contrast that with Saad Guru's advice on how to overcome the fear of being judged, and notice if anything surprising stands out to you. He doesn't let other people make him feel unhappy or happy. That's something most people don't realize. If you rely on other people to feel good about yourself, you give them the power to make you feel bad about yourself. In making this video, I couldn't help but think of Andrew Tate, one of the most disliked people on the planet. I was curious how he remains unaffected by the millions of people who hate him online. His mindset is surprisingly similar to Saad Guru. Now again, the goal is not to completely stop caring about other people. You don't want to only care about yourself and end up hurting other people or treating them badly. The goal is simply to feel free enough to live the life you want and pursue your dreams, while still being a kind, empathetic person. After you leave the validation casino, you'll realize something. Here's the truth for most people, most of the time. Obsessing over someone else's opinion of you feels silly when you realize that most of the time, they're just thinking about themselves. And even if they are thinking negative thoughts about you, if you zoom out, you'll realize their opinions don't matter anyway. This is not meant to depress you, but to inspire you to live the life you want to live. There's a specific question I set as a phone reminder that's helpful for remembering this. What will matter when I'm 90? Seeing this pop up on your phone every day will help you realize what truly matters to you. The last way to stop caring what people think is self-acceptance. A big reason you're scared that other people are thinking negative thoughts about you is because you're afraid there's some truth to what they're thinking. Often the reason you care so much about what other people think is because there are things about yourself you're ashamed of. So for example, you worry they'll think you're weird because you think you're weird. And the cure is to accept that you are weird. If you aren't ashamed of something, you won't care if people tease you about it. For example, watch how Mila Kunis reacts to being teased for playing World of Warcraft. Other people cannot make you feel shame. They can only trigger you to make yourself feel shame. That shame comes from a misguided sense that you're supposed to be perfect. You aren't perfect. No one is. There's no embarrassment in struggle. If you accept yourself fully, no one can ever make you feel bad about yourself. So now the question is, how can you accept yourself in those moments when you don't feel okay with your weirdness or your imperfections? You use the best friend trick. Ask yourself, what advice would you give to your best friend in this situation? Because you likely have more grace and empathy for them than you do for yourself. Now some people are afraid of self-acceptance because they think it'll steal their motivation to improve. Ironically, this is the opposite of true. Self-acceptance is extremely important if your goal is to grow and change because you cannot get where you want to go until you admit where you are. The people who we see struggle the most with improving their charisma are the ones who refuse to admit to themselves that they aren't already charismatic. Their friends don't respect them, their dating lives are bad, they aren't getting the jobs they want, but they always blame it on something external. They can't grow because they can't admit to themselves that they need to grow. So if you want to grow and improve yourself, start by accepting where you are. Acceptance does not mean, I love where I am and I want to stay here forever. It means it's okay that this is where you are today. From that place, there's no limit to how much you can improve. If you specifically want to improve your charisma and confidence, you might like our video program Charisma University. Past members have written us that after going through CU, they've seen social outcomes like more friends and a better dating life, and career advancements like raises, promotions, and new job offers. Even more importantly, you'll have more self-confidence and higher self-esteem. If you want to learn more, click the link on screen or in the description below. Either way, I hope today's video has helped give you the courage to stop caring so much what other people think and to more fully embrace your weird, perfectly imperfect true \", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 617}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Sometimes, we know for sure that we've done something to make people dislike us. Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me. But other times, it's less obvious and the slap isn't the only thing that is causing Will to receive huge backlash. There were several more common mistakes that turned people against him. That's why, in this video, we're going to cover three of the more subtle things Will did so that you can avoid these mistakes in your own life. We'll also get into the real reason that Will hit Chris — something I haven't seen anyone else talk about yet. First off, though, when it comes to things that make people dislike you, triangulating yourself into your significant other's relationships. After Jada got upset about Chris's joke, a lot of people suggested that the best course of action for Will would have been to speak to Chris at the end of the event, man-to-man. But they're actually making this mistake. The best course of action would have been for Jada to speak to Chris because she was the one who took offense. Will laughed. This isn't to say that you can't stick up for your partner but in situations when you don't share your partner's feelings, it's generally best for you to step back and let them handle their own business. We triangulate ourselves, though, into their conflicts when we don't trust our partner's emotional maturity. Either we believe they'll handle the situation poorly so we intervene to mellow things out or we believe they'll misplace their upset feelings on us so we make a strong sign of solidarity to save our own skin. But everyone else knows what's going on and they hate watching you mediate for someone who ought to be mature enough to handle their relationships. So while it is important to listen and empathize with your partner and, of course, stepping in the case of physical violence is warranted, it's important to trust them to privately handle most interpersonal conflicts. If doing that goes terribly because they explode on the other person or on you, that's a sign you shouldn't be in that relationship in the first place. The second thing that we saw from Will was dodging ownership of his bad behavior. His acceptance speech went on for six minutes and at no point did he apologize to Chris for hitting him though somehow, the Academy got an apology for watching him do it. I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. Now there is a fine line between what deserves an apology and what does not and I certainly don't advise you to apologize when you're convinced you've done nothing wrong. I do advise you, though, to look for signs that you might be self-deceiving to protect your ego. One of those signs is when you feel compelled to speak highly of yourself after a heated interaction like Will did in his acceptance speech comparing himself to Richard Williams. Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. I'm being called on in my life to love people and to protect people and to be a river to my people. When you frame your behavior around a conflict not simply as justified but as virtuous, it might be because you know that you behave poorly and you're trying to counter-correct for the guilt you feel. So if you feel a strong urge to defend yourself from people who aren't attacking you, they just watched you do something, you probably need to take some time away. Reflect on how you'd feel if your positions were reversed and someone did to you what you did to them. If that makes you see your behavior in a new perspective, apologize directly. And if you ever find yourself saying, Love will make you do crazy things. Take a long pause. You probably aren't acting out of love and you just did something terrible. Which takes us to the third point — people hate feeling like you're carrying emotional baggage from the past to your interactions with them. To do what we do, you got to be able to take abuse. You got to be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business, you got to be able to have people disrespecting you. You got to smile and you got to pretend like that's okay. Now, Will isn't wrong and I think people probably don't sympathize enough with the stresses of superstardom. Having millions of people speculate about and mock your relationship is brutal. But no matter how hard you're played, letting your upset feelings out on someone unrelated is a sure way to make people despise you. So you must find ways to clear lingering bad feelings before you unleash them on those around you. And it's here we need to dive deep because not dragging the past around is a lot easier said than done. So we're going to use Will as an example from which you can learn an incredibly valuable framework. For Will, the past that caused this slap is far more than the gossip about his relationship. It goes back to his childhood where he, like all of us, experienced things he couldn't handle. Here's one major example from his life read to him from his own memoir. I watched my father punch my mother in the side of her head so hard that she collapsed. I saw her spit blood. That moment in that bedroom, probably more than any other moment in my life, has defined who I am. I've carried most of my life the sense of failing every woman I interact with. This is a traumatic experience. It created emotions that a child would have no way of processing. And even if you had a wonderful childhood, you have experiences like this too that you had no way of handling given your maturity. Something as normal as a firstborn struggling to share mom and dad's love with a new sibling could qualify. Whatever the source of traumatic overwhelm, our psyches protect us by repressing the memory and the emotions surrounding it. My mother and I never talked about it until I read her the chapter. My mother and I, for my entire life, we never brought it up. This pattern of compartmentalizing and then not discussing trauma is classic. In fact, the things that have traumatized you may honestly seem like no big deal. When you think about them, they don't even really bother you so talking about them seems like a waste of time. But even if you don't think about the past, the underlying emotions are still there in the subconscious and they create an indelible influence that drives more of our lives than we can imagine. For the most part of my adult life, from that moment in that bedroom, I carry a sense of not being good enough, not being able to protect the women I love. Will is describing coping mechanisms — patterns that do not directly process trauma but allow us to manage it. Sometimes, these coping mechanisms are obviously destructive like cutting or developing an eating disorder but sometimes, these coping mechanisms have positive benefits in our lives. For instance, a child raised with fears of not having enough money might work really hard to earn as a grown-up. In Will's case, he felt he let his mother down so he became a charmer and built his self-esteem around this. The entire basis for my self-esteem was foundationally dependent upon whether or not my woman was happy. My self-image was inexorably bound up in my woman's opinion and approval of me. Similarly, to avoid his dad's wrath, he became the funny guy. That coping mechanism catapulted his career but it also caused him to laugh off things that upset him for years. For instance, there was a lot of deflecting with humor in his conversations with Jada about her relationship with August Alsina. I got into an entanglement with August. That's what I said. An entanglement? Yes. Yes. A relationship. Yes, it was a relationship. Absolutely. And this is the issue with even the helpful coping mechanisms — they come with a price. In exchange for avoiding direct confrontation with difficult emotions, we make our whole lives a reaction to trauma. For instance, the child raised in poverty might never confront the terror of not having enough and instead work non-stop to make money far beyond what they need to be happy. A child who becomes the funny guy might bottle up their negative emotions until they erupt explosively and a child who couldn't protect his mother from abuse may never confront the helplessness that he felt and instead, believe he's constantly being called on to protect women like he couldn't in the past. I got to protect Anjanue Ellis. I got to protect Saniya. I'm being called on in my life to protect people. But as a 53-year-old man, what is Will protecting these women from? Is it really necessary? Trauma will say yes because the traumatized parts of your psyche are stuck. They never grew up so they want to recreate the past and somehow fix it. That's why Will sees women who need protection everywhere. That way, he avoids the helplessness that he felt from not being able to protect the one woman he wanted to save most. But recreating the past and making amends doesn't actually heal trauma. It is the trauma response. Trauma is healed by embracing the truth. My guess is that Will needs to embrace the limits of his responsibility. It wasn't his responsibility as a young boy to protect his mother from his father and it's not his responsibility as a husband to protect Jada from a joke. He needs to learn to let adults, women in particular, work out their issues without feeling called to intervene. Of course, there are totally legitimate moments where physical protection and even some offense would be necessary but the trauma makes it difficult for Will to tell the difference. Will also needs to learn to find the middle ground between laughing off pain and exploding. Directly expressing how he's been hurt without joking or snapping would be a great growth for him and maybe you, too, if you're also prone to comedic deflection. And if you want to begin the process of relaxing your coping mechanisms and confronting uncomfortable truths, there's one that we almost all could benefit from and that's the mass coping mechanism of worrying about other people's character, particularly celebrities. Judgment of anyone often serves to bolster our own egos. I'd never do that, we say, which makes us feel morally superior and distracts us from our own issues. This doesn't imply that you have to approve of everything that other people do though. For instance, Will hitting Chris was wrong. He should apologize. But spending energy on what Will or anyone else ought to do differently protects you from the more uncomfortable task of identifying what you need to do differently in your life. So if you want to make sure you're not dragging your past around, focus on your own self. Identify your coping mechanisms, the truths you've been hiding. Hopefully, Will's example has sparked a recognition of something that maybe you hadn't looked at before. And if not, a few of the best ways I know to begin purposely addressing trauma are meditation, therapy, holotropic breathwork, and the conscious use of psychedelics. These are much larger topics for another video but they are by far the most powerful ways I know of to unwind trauma. And granted, they aren't all as easy or self-satisfying as celebrity gossip, at least in the moment, but in the long term, the benefits that you get from these types of practices that take you inward are far more valuable and you'll be a much happier person for doing them. In the meantime, if one of the areas you think you could improve is your confidence, you might like our course, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step video guided program that is guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in 30 days. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below but I think that the strongest way to let you know what it's all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few of the things that our CU members have written in. The first is from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I, hands down, had the best interview out of everybody and they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. Another person wrote about their social life saying, It has been truly incredible. I've instantly had results that seem insane. I've made so many more meaningful connections, my friendships have improved, and my interactions with total strangers are a new, exciting, fulfilling thing. I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system. And this last one is from someone who says that the course has been life-changing. And he says, Your course has been life-changing to the point where I wake up in the mornings feeling like I've been transferred to a new person's body — the person I kept dreaming about becoming before I found Charisma on Command. It is incredible. I found myself and I found what makes me happy. And you can see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do so, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all. And I make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value out of the course otherwise, you can just refund. So, if you want to check the course out, go ahead, click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course, get a ton out of it — introverts, extroverts, men and women from all over the globe — and I would love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope that you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 731}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Some people mistakenly think that to be charismatic you have to be loud and energetic all the time, but that isn't true. So today you'll learn 7 tricks to be charismatic and make a great first impression, even if you're quiet. We'll do this by breaking down some clips of Chris Pine since he's both soft-spoken and incredibly likable. The first thing to consider is what are the benefits of being loud that you may be missing out on if you're quiet? One is that it's easier to grab attention in conversation, especially in groups. But there is another way you can do this. Active speaking. Sync hand gestures with your words. Watch this clip of Chris to see what this looks like. Good hand gestures aren't random movements, you want to accent what you're saying. For a great example, watch Chris talk about learning the Scottish accent for his movie Outlaw King. Purposely using hand gestures also gives your hand something to do, which naturally cuts down on nervous fidgeting, making you look and feel more confident. One other thing you'll notice when Chris talks, he smiles with his eyes and speaks through a smile, which primes people to smile and laugh with you. Smiling as you speak also naturally changes your vocal tone in a positive way, so even if you're just having a phone call, you can make a better impression if you smile before you speak. This is why salespeople have the phrase smile and dial. Notice in this next clip how the audience laughs when Chris starts to smile with his eyes and get more animated with his face. One thing today's video will hopefully make clear, just because someone speaks quietly doesn't mean they're boring. Just listen to Gal describe what it's like to work with Chris. That playfulness is especially important in the first few minutes of your conversation because people have a heavy first impression bias. They form their first opinions about you in the first minute or two, and those first opinions can be very sticky. So in social settings, try to be playful and fun in the first few minutes of meeting someone. You don't have to have a great stand-up comedy set to open a conversation. Any playfulness at all can help set a more positive tone. If being playful seems intimidating, you can also simply lead with a little more energy and enthusiasm. Many quiet people do the opposite of this. They begin overly serious and low-energy, and by the time they start being playful in a conversation, the other person has already made up their mind about them. Now, while speaking through a smile and being playful help you leave a positive first impression, the mirror of this is also true. You can make people like you simply by being a likable listener who laughs easily. You'll make the other person feel good and they'll enjoy speaking to you. Notice in this next clip how Chris can make co-star Gal Gadot laugh just by laughing himself. Compare that to this next clip of Chris where he doesn't smile, laugh, or speak with his hands. If this were the only clip you'd ever seen of Chris, what would your impression of him be? One important caveat here, your goal is not to fake laugh. The goal is to laugh freely whenever you do find something funny. Unfortunately, many people unconsciously limit their laughter, repressing it to a quick chuckle or even just an exhale. The good news if you are someone who struggles to laugh is that laughing is a habit and it gets easier the more you do it. So one trick if you want to laugh more easily, watch something you know will make you laugh right before going out. This will prime you to be in a better state and to laugh more in conversation. Ultimately, the goal is to be confident enough to show your genuine emotional reaction. In Chris's case, he does not force himself to laugh with a group every time they laugh. But if Chris does find something funny, he definitely lets it show. It shows confidence if you're willing to show your genuine reaction even when it makes you stand out from the people around you. There's one more trick you can use to make people like you without you needing to do much talking. Ask energizing questions. A question is energizing if it's open-ended, meaning not a one-word answer, and about a topic that excites the other person. This next clip is a great easy example. Graham Norton asks Sally Fields a question about her memoir that leaves her a little tongue-tied. So Chris asks her a question she's more excited to answer. While today's video has hopefully shown you that you can be charismatic even if you're quiet, there are a few times when even the quietest person would benefit from being louder. One time this is helpful is in very loud environment settings like parties. And another is when someone cuts you off. When someone tries to speak over you, it can be helpful to raise your voice to recapture attention. But once you've recaptured attention, you can return to your quieter, more natural speaking voice. For example, listen to Chris talking to Jimmy about the time a supposed fan confused him with multiple other celebrities. Now for everything in this video and everything related to charisma in general, knowing intellectually what to do is one thing. Having the confidence to go out and do it is another. If you want the quickest way that I know of to take both your confidence and charisma to the next level, then you may like our program Charisma University. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that our past members have said. I had confidence in some areas, but not in others. Then Charisma University changed that for me. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. Another member wrote in, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. In conversation, I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think. I feel much happier all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman I've had a crush on for about a year and made a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep going back to it when I need a refresher on the daily action modules. And lastly, one member writes, Thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma University, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values and I know who I am. The program comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee so you can take the entire course and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund from right inside the program. If you want to see if Charisma University is right for you, click the link on screen now or in the description below.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"With everything going on in the world, online dating is absolutely booming and that means that more and more newbies are joining and more and more of the same common mistakes are being made all the time. You don't want to be that person because it means you're getting fewer matches and probably less likely to meet someone that you really like. So that's why, in this video, I want to cover five of the most common mistakes people make on these apps and what you can do instead so you wind up standing out from the crowd, you get more matches, and hopefully, you really meet someone that you like. So the first piece comes down to the bio. Believe it or not, more than half of people on Tinder have a bio that is either completely empty, is just emojis, or is a quote that somebody else said. That's over half of people which means that if you have anything better than that, you've instantly stood out from the crowd in a very positive way. Now, none of us are naturally good at writing these bios but there is a structure that you can take right now and it will instantly spruce it up. It's got three parts. The first piece is something funny. The second piece is going to be something interesting, your values, what you like. Just talk about yourself in an authentic way. And then, the third piece is a call to action that gives someone something that they could say to you if they wanted to start a conversation. So the first piece going to something funny, just as an example, my friend, I believe, married someone that he met with this so he doesn't mind me sharing. He used to have something that said, didn't work out for me on farmersonly.com or mulletpassions.com so giving this a try... He said that he got a lot of initial messages that thought that that was very funny. Now, I'm not saying steal that one. If you all steal it, it's not going to work. But just anything funny, tongue-in-cheek, works here. One line, plenty. The second piece, share your values. What do you like? What is interesting about you? What cool hobbies do you have? What projects are you working on? Anything that lets them know what is cool, interesting, fun, engaging about you, works here. A lot of people make the mistake of talking about all the things they don't like. Trump voters swipe left, Hillary voters swipe... This isn't the place for it. Talk about what you're interested in. And then the third piece is a little fun filter that gives the person something to say to you. So I used to have in my bio, basically, what was it? If you're a fan of salsa dancing or red wine, hit me up, we'll probably get along. And so a lot of the first messages that I would receive would be related to red wine. What kind of wine do you like or where do you salsa dance? And it just made conversation flow much more easy. So take this, gimme. A lot of people are blowing it. The second piece comes down to photos, right? I'm not going to say be more attractive, right? That's for a different channel that talks about style and fashion. But a lot of people are blowing it simply with the quality of their photos. And I mean this, if you went to Facebook and you had a photo with a bunch of friends and you cropped in on you and it looks like it was shot on a potato in the dark, unfortunately, you're blowing it. When you're looking at something for a short period of time, the actual quality of the photo has a lot to do with whether it appears attractive. So take the time to either select good photos or it's really easy nowadays, get a friend or if you have one that has the new iPhone with portrait mode, snap some photos, they look so much better. The second piece is having photos that don't tell a story about you, right? A lot of people might just have photos where they're sitting around watching TV, it's a couple of friends, and that's fine for one or two, but you want to have an idea of who this person is. So a really good question is what adjectives would I use to describe myself in this photo if I didn't know myself? And if you're happy and you feel like these are accurate ways like you see yourself with your family, so you're family-oriented, or you're playing sports, okay, you're interested in sports, you're athletic, or you've got music, so you're musical, find something that tells a story about you. That's going to go so much farther than the generic, me with my friends, me with my friends, me with a cocktail, yada, yada, yada. It doesn't work nearly as well. The third piece comes down to that opening message and you can guess it. What is the most common opening message that everybody sends? Hey. Do not send hey. Do not send hey. Women, you are particularly guilty of this, I know, because any time that I look at Bumble and all the initial messages will be, hey, this does not work. It communicates to the other person that they are going to have to put in all of the work to make this conversation interesting and usually the hey is paired with a profile that's very sparse, which just makes it even harder. And in my own case, I know there's been people that I otherwise would have been physically attracted to that was like, I can't, I'm not going to put in all the effort to figure something out about this person who doesn't appear to want to try. So in your case, you don't have to be a witty genius. All that you have to do is have some sort of a question that's going to be engaging for that other person and it's not, how was your day? It's not, how's quarantine going? None of that. It's got to be something different. So what I would ask is, are you a fan of salsa dancing? And I would often get the response, or I have been, or I haven't been, but I would love to know more, and then we could start conversation and when it did come time for us to hang out, if we got along, I could invite them out salsa dancing. It made sense. So find what that question is for you and it can relate to a hobby that works excellent. Fourth piece, staying in messaging, right? If you are staying in whatever app that it is in, you have to consider, even if you're getting along really well via messages, that you're staying in a bucket of other people, 99% of whom that person won't ever meet. So think of it, if you look at anybody's matches and take any woman who is out there, she's probably got a ton of matches on these apps, they all occupy a spot in her brain that is not very important. So when you switch and you move to social media and you're messaging on Instagram or you're texting, all of a sudden, that text message or that message on Instagram stands out in a way that connects so much more to her. You are instantly more than the other throngs of people that are in there that are just sending her messages and most of whom she will never meet or speak to. So after you guys have a bit of rapport, you can say something to the effect of, Hey, I prefer not to message on here. Here's my Instagram, feel free to add me there. This also gives the person a chance to look at you beyond the six photos that you have in that tiny bio and to learn more about who you were today but also potentially five years ago and that makes people feel a lot better when it comes time to deciding if they want to get to know you more or meet up. This brings us to the fifth point and one that is absolutely put on pause for social distance and quarantine. This is not a piece of advice that is a mistake anymore but it often is just messaging and messaging and messaging, right? If you do this over and over and over again, eventually someone will ask this person out, they'll go out with them and all of a sudden, they'll be up here, the person that they spend time with and you'll be here, the person that is still pen pals with them, right? You need to eventually find some way to spend time with them and that's why I like to start with the salsa dancing thing. When it was time to hang out, it was very obvious what we could do together. Now, given that social distancing is an appropriate thing to do, this can be switched to a phone call. Quite frankly, you can do this when this is over too. Getting on the phone with someone also puts you in a different bracket in their brain than everybody else who they've only messaged with and it also gives you a chance to see if you like them, see if they like you back, works out much, much better. So just don't text forever, get on the phone, or find an opportunity to meet up.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 419}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all had conversations that feel forced, awkward, or just boring. Sometimes, it gets to the point where you have no idea what to say, like this next clip. While it's funny on TV, in real life, these conversations are painful. So in this video, we'll go over 5 common mistakes that lead to boring conversations and what you can do instead to have an amazing conversation. We'll do this using clips from some of the best conversationalists that we've covered on the channel so far. The first mistake people make in conversation is energy ducking. Energy ducking is when you come into a conversation with low enthusiasm to avoid standing out. The problem is, when you make your main focus not standing out, you avoid making a negative or positive impression. While being able to read the other person's mood is important, it's equally important to realize that most people want to have fun, funny conversations. They just aren't sure how. So if you want to stop having boring conversations, stop energy ducking and be the first to initiate playfulness. Watch Jack Black in this next clip for an extreme example. While most talk show guests simply walk out, wave, and take a seat, Jack immediately establishes he's there to mess around and have a good time. Obviously, Jack Black is an over-the-top example. In your own life, you're going to want a way to consistently make conversations more playful without having to flip furniture. By far the easiest way to initiate playfulness in your life is after you've been asked a question. To do so, just answer with an absurd, non-literal answer. For instance, watch how Chris Pratt answers this question about his son who was born severely premature. This isn't about ducking the question. Eventually, you will give a real answer and share about yourself. It's just about setting a fun, playful tone first. Another perk of being playful, it's very likely that the other person will match you and be playful as well. Notice in this next clip how Craig's first joke completely changes the energy of the conversation. The second mistake people make that leads to a boring conversation is assuming interest. Have you ever been talking to someone who launched into a long story you didn't care about? It's the type of thing that can have people excusing themselves to the bathroom just to escape. The key to avoiding that mistake is to create interest before launching into your story. An easy trick for that is to start your story with a story gap. A story gap is when you build interest in a story by hinting at how it ends without spoiling the punchline. For a great example, listen to Kevin Hart tee up this story about his relationship with Michael Jordan. All the way you've run into Michael Jordan. I've ran into Mike a couple times. Mike still might be mad at me. True story. I pissed Mike off. What did you do? You already know the ending of the story. Michael Jordan gets mad at Kevin, but you want to know why and how it happens. That's the whole point of a story gap, to hint at something that the other person now wants to hear more about. For another example, listen to Tom Hanks use a story gap here. I'll tell you one thing that happens to Tom Hanks, little Tommy Hanks on that trip. Larry's brother? I'll tell you what happens to him. He gets screwed and I'll tell you how. By using a story gap, you ensure people will be interested in hearing what you have to say. Okay, so now that you've learned to share information about yourself in an interesting way, it's very likely that people will want to ask you more about yourself. This is where the next common mistake comes in. If you regularly find conversation stalls after you've been asked a question, you may be giving bland one to five word answers. A bland answer doesn't set the other person up with anything to say back. This happens all the time in small talk. Where are you from? Philadelphia. What do you do? I work in finance. Short answers put the conversational pressure on the other person. Now they have to carry the conversation or else let it fall into awkward silence. It's a bit of an extreme case, but watch this clip with Kanye and Jimmy Kimmel to see an example of this. Do you dress them? Do you pick their outfits? You do. Is that fun for you? Do you design outfits for them? You do. Do they love that? I mean, do they understand that process that you draw something and then it becomes their clothes? Kanye's short answers there put all the pressure on Jimmy to carry the conversation. On the other hand, listen to Sylvester Stallone after Jimmy Fallon asks about his relationship with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger, I've read that you guys actually hated each other for a while. Well, we were very competitive. Yeah, I think hate's a good word. It is. Come on. Stallone could have just ended there and it wouldn't have been a bad answer by any means because it was funny, but he elaborates, which gives Jimmy more to respond to. Did you ever hate somebody so much you go, I got to get to the gym. I got to, you know, a musician go, oh, I hate this guy. I'm going to blow him away next audition. It was like the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. They kept releasing great albums. Now, this isn't to say that you should ramble every time someone asks you a question. You want to share enough to make conversation easy for the other person, but then create space for them to speak as well. It's important to realize that having a memorable conversation doesn't mean you have to do all the talking. In fact, great conversationalists do the opposite. They get the other person excited to talk as well. That brings us to the next common mistake people make in conversation. They ask the same default boring questions. This next clip is scripted to purposely be boring, so it's sad how often our real life conversations look just like this. So you live in California? Yeah, I live in Venice, California. So you hang out with a lot of showbiz types? Yeah. So when you're asking questions, try to ask something that the other person will be excited to answer. Sean Evans is a master at this. He specifically focuses on asking questions about his guests' passions or that let them reflect on things they're proud of. He also avoids the questions they've likely been asked a hundred times in interviews before, and you can see the reactions it gets him. A special affinity towards Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, and if so, does it inform the music at all? Bro, I'm impressed with these questions. Thank you, man. When you first moved from Nebraska to California to chase that dream, what level of success seemed realistic to you? What would be your minimum accomplishment for you to feel like, well, wow, I made it? That's cool. I don't know if I've ever answered that question. When you think about all the times that you've been name-checked in rap lyrics, which one's your favorite? Oh, that's... If you're talking to someone you just met and you don't know anything about their interests yet, you can also get people excited to talk by asking fun hypotheticals. Joe Rogan is a master of this, and it's part of why people like going on his podcast. Had a magic wand and someone said, you could do whatever you want to fix this, what would you do? You were the king of the world. Said, Ed, what are we going to do? Let's say you become president. What if questions like that are fun to answer because they let people talk about their values without being constrained by their own potentially boring lives? In addition, these fantasy style questions instantly make conversation more fun because the person you're talking to gets to imagine these dream scenarios as they answer the question. If you were mayor of New York, what would be your first order of business? What would be the day one action? Okay, this is a good one. Let's go into a specific example you can use in your own life. If you meet someone and ask about their job, but they don't seem excited to talk about it, try following up with a question. Well, what if you had a hundred million dollars and you could do anything you want? What would you do instead? This will let them dive into whatever's most important to them, which they will love to talk about. Okay, so now that the other person is talking, we get to the last common mistake people make in conversation, being a passive listener. Talking to someone who's too passive when listening can be boring and even uncomfortable. There's two great tricks to make yourself a likable listener who's fun to talk to, and they're both very easy. The first is mirroring by repeating a pattern of behavior of the person you're talking to. This can be gestures, the way they're seated, or the last few words someone says. The second easy way to be a likable listener is listening to laugh. For example, watch how easily Joe Rogan laughs with his guests, even when they aren't trying to be funny. Sometimes the thing that most makes someone like you is not when you are smart or funny, but when you make them feel smart or funny. Hearing their own words spoken back to them with an encouraging voice, or seeing that they've made you laugh, can go a long way towards someone enjoying their time with you. For one last example, watch in this next clip how Craig's guest smiles wider and wider the more Craig cracks up at his joke. It's important to note here, the goal is not to fake laugh. Instead, you want to cultivate the ability to laugh freely whenever you do find something funny, rather than censor your laughter like most people do, limiting it to a quick chuckle or even just an exhale. If you currently struggle to laugh when you're in conversation, that's totally fine. Laughing is a habit that gets easier the more you do it. So a good practice is to watch something you know will make you laugh right before you go out. This will prime you to be in a better state to laugh when you're in conversation. And that's how to never be boring in conversation. Now, if you enjoy these videos, but sometimes find it hard to put all of it into practice when you're actually in conversation, you may like our video program, Charisma University. It's a more step-by-step guide that lays out exactly how to turn our most important charisma advice into effortless, unthinking habit so you can turn it on when you need it. It takes just 20-30 minutes a day and each day comes with a daily action guide so you know exactly how to put what you're learning into practice. And it's sequential, so each day builds upon the last. It also comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee that's for any reason whatsoever, so the only way you pay anything is if you think it was worth more than the money you invested into it. I could go on about the program, but rather than tell you what I think, let's take a look at what some of the members have said about their experience after going through Charisma University. The first one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career. And he says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet, they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills, which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you were open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you taught me. You've truly changed my life because without Charisma University, I wouldn't have qualified for this position in a million lifetimes. Now, this next one comes from another person who started a new job. They say, I wanted to let you know that I nailed those first days at work. Everything that I needed was right there at the moment I needed it. The confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset. And with all your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it just could not go wrong. And he finishes by saying, I just wanted to emphasize that what I did the previous days would even not have come to my mind if I had not discovered that Charisma is a skill that can be learned thanks to your YouTube channel and university program. And this last one is a comment from inside the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their social and dating life. And he says, life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. And there are more success stories just like those in the comments. If you do decide to join the course, if you want to check the course out, click the link on screen now or below in the description, we've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it. And I hope that you join. If this is an area of your life that you're looking to improve either way, I hope this video has helped you and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 827}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Avatar The Last Airbender is all about the journey of learning new skills from novice to master. It's an animated show, so obviously not everything in it is realistic, but it's very well written and there are lessons you can take from it to help you master almost any skill, whether you're interested in sports, languages, music, or social skills. We'll go over some things Avatar gets both right and wrong so that you can learn any skill way faster and avoid some common mistakes that will stall your learning. Combine this with our other video and you'll be learning at superhuman speed. The first thing to do to master a skill faster is find the right teacher for you. This can be someone who teaches in person, but it can also be a video program or even a book. But you have to be careful who you learn from. Not everyone who's mastered a skill is going to be a good teacher, so there are three learning principles you want to follow to make sure you advance as quickly as possible. The first thing you want is to make sure that each day builds upon the last. If you're learning random things each day and today's lesson doesn't build directly on the last thing you worked on, then you're going to struggle to remember and perfect what you learned before. The second thing you want is someone who teaches you based on your current skill level. As Aang learns while earthbending, there's no point in trying to learn something advanced if you don't have the fundamentals. So what move are you going to teach me first? Rock-a-lanch? The trembler? Oh, maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool out of land. Let's start with move a rock. Sounds good. Sounds good. In the show, learning can seem very linear, but in real life, it's more complicated. How do you know which part of the basics to focus on? And if you've got the basics down, how do you know what to focus on next? The answer is to try the thing you want to master and see what area you find yourself most frequently running into trouble. For example, let's say your goal is to have a conversation in a new language. Many teachers focus on vocab lists, having you learn animals, colors, and how to count to 100. The problem is when you try to have an actual conversation in that new language, you'll find you rarely have to say the phrase 88 purple pigs. Instead, find a teacher that focuses on your most frequent sticking point, which is likely how to introduce yourself and ask or answer introductory conversation questions. The third thing you want in a teacher is someone who teaches in a style that matches how you learn. For example, Aang wilts under a tough love approach to teaching. By contrast, when his teacher takes Katara's advice and focuses on positive reinforcement, Aang flourishes. Unfortunately, books, videos, and even most in-person instructors won't be able to adapt their teaching style to suit your learning style, so the best thing you can do is keep track of your progress when you're learning from a new source. What gets measured gets managed, so by tracking your progress, you can see if you're actually getting better or if you're stuck and need to try something new. The second key to mastering a skill is setting goals that are a stretch for your abilities but are within your abilities. If you regularly set goals outside your abilities, you run the risk of getting demoralized and giving up. This is exactly what happens to Aang when he moves too fast with firebending. By contrast, if you set goals that stretch your abilities but are achievable, you'll set yourself up for a dopamine rush that makes the learning process feel great. This is exactly what they show when Aang pushes himself to earthbend for the first time. That type of dopamine rush will keep you motivated to learn more. One thing worth noting when setting goals, make sure success is completely in your control. For example, if you're trying to improve at starting conversations with strangers, don't make your goal to make people like you. Make your goal something like, start three conversations today with people I don't already know. Once you've started three conversations, celebrate it as a win no matter how those conversations go. Celebrating your wins is one of the best ways to achieve the third key to mastering a skill which is to find a way to make it fun to practice. For most of us, you're way more likely to put in the practice to master something if you actually enjoy the process. That's one of Aang's greatest strengths — he loves to learn. Today is the day! Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! One of the best ways you can make something fun is to find someone to learn with. This gives you someone to motivate you when you're not feeling inspired, to make practice fun, and to celebrate your wins with. Aang and Katara show this dynamic very well. At first, Aang is naturally more talented than Katara at waterbending, which motivates her to practice harder than she was on her own. Then, through dedicated practice, Katara surpasses Aang, at which point instead of gloating, she works with him to help him catch up. You make a fine octopus, pupil Aang. So how do you find a friend to learn with? First, broadcast to your existing friend group what you're interested in learning. You may already have a friend who's quietly interested in the same thing or who becomes interested when they hear you talking about it. Second, if the skill you're learning puts you around other people with a similar interest, start conversations with them. For example, if you're surfing, start conversations with the other people in the water. If you're playing pickup basketball, talk to the guys on your team after the game. Third, you can look for meetups, Facebook groups, or forums that are specific to your location. You know these people live near you and they already share your interests, so now you get to filter for who you hit it off with. This way, you don't have to rely on finding your new friend floating in a chunk of ice. Now, one thing that stands out about Aang that we've already touched on is that he's willing to learn from his friends. He doesn't let his ego get in the way of his learning. This is extremely common to struggle with once you're average or above average. If you desire to have a self-image that you're already good at something, it can blind you to your shortcomings. A great way to tell if you're guilty of this is if you blame your struggles on other people or external circumstances. Sokka is particularly guilty of this early on when he loses a fight. Sokka, what's your problem? Eat. Not hungry. But you're always hungry. He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday. They snuck up on me. Right, and then they kicked your butt. But after getting beat a second time, he realizes it wasn't luck and credit to him, he puts his ego aside and tries to improve himself instead of making excuses. Uh, hey, Sookie. Hoping for another dance lesson? No, well, let me explain. Spit it out. What do you want? I would be honored if you would teach me. The parallel in charisma would be making a bunch of bad first impressions and blaming those people instead of looking at yourself. This is very common in dating where you'll often see someone try to approach a stranger to start a conversation, have it go poorly, and then come back talking trash about the person they just approached. If you catch yourself doing this, then it's a sign to step back and re-evaluate how you approach people. Now, while the Avatar show has a surprising amount of wisdom for a cartoon, it does breeze over one aspect of learning a skill, which is the length of time it takes to achieve mastery. For example, here's Sokka on his first day of sword training. Now, here he is sparring the same guy after having greatly improved. Guess how many days he trained between these two clips. If you guessed less than one day, you're right. Unfortunately for us, unless you're an insanely gifted savant, that's not how learning a skill actually works. For most skills, if you want to improve rapidly, you'll want to practice at least three times a week. But that doesn't mean you need to practice all day every day. There are ways you can use your time more intelligently to get the quickest results for the time you put in. For example, instead of doing one three-hour session a week, you could do two one-hour sessions and two 30-minute sessions spread out over four days. This spaced-out recurring practice schedule will help you master your skills faster. Katara is the character that most closely resembles what learning is actually like. She starts off unable to do much, but through regular practice, she becomes amazing. Katara, you have proven that with fierce determination, passion, and hard work, you can accomplish anything. If you want to learn more about how to master any skill quickly, I highly recommend The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin. I first heard of it from Tim Ferriss years ago and it is incredibly helpful if you want to understand how to learn faster and more effectively.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all been there before — you see someone that you want to meet but you aren't quite sure what to say. You get nervous and overthink it, eventually not saying anything at all. That scenario is awful so in this video, you're going to learn five easy ways to start a conversation in any situation. Now, the first conversation starter is, Hey, I don't think I've met you yet. I'm... and then, your name. This is great for situations like house parties, networking events, college campuses — basically, anywhere that some people already know one another. And it's amazing because saying, I haven't met you yet, makes you look social and popular because you're indicating that you know most of the people at the venue already. And by leading with the reason that you're introducing yourself, you make the introduction and the subsequent conversation feel much more natural. Now, the second conversation starter works best in situations where people aren't necessarily expecting to meet strangers like a coffee shop or a grocery store which makes it a great tag team with the first one. And it's, Hey, I know this is totally random but... followed by anything that you notice about the person. For example, Hey, I know this is totally random but I saw that you're wearing an Eagles jersey. Are you from Philly? Jerseys and hats with logos are particularly nice because most people have strong feelings about where they grew up or where they went to university. And because this conversation starter acknowledges the randomness of the situation, it stops you from coming across as a weirdo. You show that you get the social norms and are simply confident enough to bypass them when you have something to say and you really want to meet someone. Now, our third conversation starter is the tourist technique and it's great for any time you find yourself somewhere new whether that's a country, a part of town, or simply a new bar. And you basically just allow yourself to be the lost tourist asking locals for directions or advice. For instance, when I was abroad, I started most new conversations by saying, Hey, I'm new in town. Do you know where the university is or this restaurant is or whatever I was looking for at the time? Similarly, if you're out at a new bar or restaurant, you can ask the other patrons, Hey, I'm new to the area. Do you have any recommendations for fun things to do around here? By saying that you're new to the area, you are way more likely to get a long helpful answer that can lead to a real conversation and it also invites questions like, well, where are you coming from that allow the conversation to develop further. Now, the fourth conversation starter is the Ben Franklin and here, you're starting the conversation by asking for a small favor. So for example, at a coffee shop, office, or classroom, you can ask someone to watch your stuff for a second while you go somewhere. Then, when you come back, you can just simply say, Thanks so much. By the way, I'm and then your name. Now, you're in conversation. This takes advantage of what psychologists call the Ben Franklin effect. Basically, once someone has done a small favor for you, they're going to rationalize that they've done it because they like you. And the nice thing about this method is that it's an indirect way to start a conversation so it takes very little social courage. The downside is that because it's indirect, you have to transition the conversation to something besides the favor if you actually want to connect with that person which is why our fifth conversation starter might be a better bet and that one is called the spontaneous compliment. Ideally, this is followed by a cold read where you guess something about the person. So for instance, if you see someone with a cool article of clothing or just cool style in general, you can say something like, Wow, you've got great style. Are you a fashion designer? Or if you see someone with a well-trained dog, you can say, That's an amazing dog. Are you a dog trainer? If delivered well, the compliment will make the person feel good and the cold read will give them an easy conversation thread to reply to so that they can keep the conversation moving without feeling awkward. Now, one warning here — you want to avoid compliments about people's bodies. That's more likely just to make them feel uncomfortable. And all of this has to feel genuine in order to start a good conversation so only go with this conversation starter if you can think of a genuine compliment that you really mean in that moment. One last important note — every conversation starter is going to be helped greatly by a smile, good energy, and confident body language. That is what makes people want to talk to you before you even speak and makes the conversation flow much more naturally after the starter. And if you want to learn more about all those nonverbals plus what to say after you've started the conversation to guarantee that you leave an amazing first impression, you might want to check out our program, Charisma University. Charisma University is a step-by-step program guaranteed to make you more confident and charismatic in just 30 days.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, we'll go through common mistakes men make when talking to women they're attracted to and what you can do instead to stop being boring and immediately be more attractive. We'll do this by breaking down some clips of Craig Ferguson so that you can get reactions like this when you're flirting. You're so cute. I forgot how much I loved you. I love it. You see, it's all coming back to you. Let's keep talking about sex. While Craig has clear advantages like being a famous TV host, a lot of what he does can be done by anybody. The first habit to learn if you want to be more attractive is to stop thinking of conversation purely as an exchange of information. Instead, focus on having fun and creating emotional spikes. There are two easy ways you can do this. The first is by answering her questions with fun, funny answers before you give your real answer. Here's a quick example from Craig just so you can see how stupidly easy this is to do. You know what a wombat is, right? A wombat? A wombat, yeah. Is that a lady bat? Especially when you're meeting someone for the first time, the first few minutes of conversation can be predictable. What do you do? Where are you from? Things like that. The majority of men give straightforward boring answers so you can set yourself apart by making her laugh. For instance, watch how Craig handles the predictable, where are you from conversation. I'm from Scotland. Jersey. Here's one more example. Notice this time how Craig starts giving a real answer but then thinks better of it and switches to a joke. I've been to Charlotte, North Carolina. Yeah? And how did you find it? I liked—well, I got off the airplane and there it was, but then— If you make someone laugh by saying something playful and unexpected, they'll instantly like you more. It really is as simple as giving a funny, obviously fake answer before giving your real one. A good tip when flirting is to answer someone's first small talk question playfully and at least 25% of the small talk questions after that. This isn't always necessary to build attraction, but it's especially helpful if you aren't sure how to answer those basic where are you from, what do you do questions in an interesting way. You can also shift boring small talk into a fun, flirty conversation by responding playfully to her answers. Are you a lawyer then? No, I'm a paralegal. Well, that's the same as a lawyer except you jump out of airplanes, right? What kind of doctor is your sister then? Internal medicine. Internal medicine, so all her work is done indoors. Most men don't respond playfully like this when they're talking to someone they're attracted to. In fact, most men make a second common mistake here — being unbelievably excited about everything she says. Listen to these next clips for some examples of this. Have you ever been here? I haven't. I have not either. Um, so I'm a full-time student, mechanical engineering. Exciting! Oh, that's awesome. I was a dancer. I danced in college. More for fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was a writer for a magazine here. That guy seems like a super nice guy, but unfortunately, just responding positively is often not enough to build attraction. That isn't to say that showing excitement is bad. In fact, in our first Craig video, we covered how he often interacts in a positive, high-energy way. But when you react to everything she says with an overly positive response, it can be a turn-off. You risk becoming predictable, and depending on your delivery, you can seem fake or desperate. What sets Craig apart, and what can set you apart, is something called push-pull, where you mix that strong positivity with some playful teasing that makes you both laugh. For example, watch how Craig bounces between compliments and teases with Alice Eve at different parts of their conversation. I'm becoming weird, I think, as a result of being an actor. It's a weird making a job. You weren't weird before? I was just a girl before. You've never been just a girl. Have you ever been to Germany? I'm buying the car off a German person. That doesn't qualify you as having visited the country. You can even do this in the same sentence, bouncing quickly between teases and compliments. What's with the spell thing? Book her again immediately! I love your dress, by the way. It's very... you can see through bits. It's a little tablecloth-y thing. Why do you keep doing that to me? You're freaking me out. I'm putting spells on you. Yeah, you've already done that. You did that when you did the knee. That's why. You see me move back like that? You did! You're just crawling away. The distance is hurting me. Listen, it has to be. This doesn't mean you have to rush to chase every compliment with a tease. Just keep it in mind so you don't become too one-dimensional. If you aren't sure exactly how to playfully tease someone while flirting, you can steal an easy style of teasing from Craig. Say cliche phrases that are normally only said by women to men. This type of spontaneous roleplay can make you both laugh and jokingly reframe that she's the one hitting on you. So, show me what you got. You can't put me on the spot like that and say, show me what you got. You've got to work up to it a little bit. Buy me dinner. No, don't just run in and must my hair. Come on. Jeff, I like your snake cup. Thanks a lot. Yeah, it's awesome, isn't it? Do you have? Do you like snake? Hey, now. Dinner first. I just wanted to see it. You want to see my fruit basket? I just wanted to hear you say that. Well, fruit basket. I mean, don't rush straight for the fruit basket. There has to be conversation first. If all you do is follow the advice already in this video, you will have more women who find you attractive. But there's one more thing Craig does in conversation to create chemistry. This is optional but it's a huge part of what makes Craig attractive. Create an environment where women feel safe being flirty and sexual. As a great example of this, watch this next clip with MMA fighter Gina Carano. She's only been talking to Craig for five minutes and you can see even she's surprised at what she's willing to say. It's honest. It's real. It's kind of like you can't really hide, you know, anything in the cage. It's just real. You're, you know, two people going at it. Yeah, it's, uh— It's kind of like sex and I'm just kidding. Hey, whatever way you get the job done. Gina's clearly embarrassed by the joke but she was willing to go there because Craig goes there first and Craig is great at introducing sex into the conversation without it seeming creepy. One reason it doesn't seem creepy is his obvious comfort with the topic. Notice in these next two clips how his tone and body language convey that to him, talking about sex isn't a big deal. Is that weird, kissing a girl because you're heterosexual? I am. Not really. Like, if I had to kiss a dude because I'm heterosexual, I'd be like, oh, this is kind of awesome. No, I mean, I— The zebra situation. Oh, the zebra, these? Check it out. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No? No? No, no, don't hurt my nipples. I, because, you know, I'm— Sensitive. Are you into S&M? I'm not really. That's a good segue. Something very important here is how non-judgmental Craig is. He doesn't shame women for their sexuality or kinks. Now, because introducing sex into the conversation does run the risk of seeming creepy, you need to calibrate to the other person, your setting, and how the conversation has gone so far. A great way to test out the topic is with playful misinterpretation. You jokingly misinterpret that they are the ones that started talking about sex. For a quick example of this, listen to Craig talk about Scotland with Michelle Monaghan. It's so beautiful there. Yes, it is. Yeah. Every time I think about it, yeah, that's true. And we were—I know. Oh, my gosh. Well, I was there during summer, too, so it goes on all night long. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can even playfully misinterpret someone was being sexual just by pausing and giving them a funny look. Do you identify with downstairs people who don't have you as servants or upstairs who are rather terribly posh? Uh, I don't watch it, but I've been both upstairs and downstairs. I'm going to answer the question now. All right. Oh. Oh, yeah. Do you cream? One thing you'll notice, Craig rarely makes a joke about them having sex together. His playful misinterpretations just introduce the topic of sex lightly while also making her laugh. And she can decide to simply laugh and move on to a new topic or double down on the joke and take it further. It's Valentine's Day, so you can squirt whatever you want. No, you can't. No, you can't. Cream, berries. No. Anything goes. No, no, no. Why not? No, I'll have to ask for that next time. No, don't ask for it. It's very, very painful. But I might like a little pain. Well, we're out of time here. That was so fast. I mean, not fast. Not fast. It's okay. Don't be embarrassed. I was excited. Again, this isn't to say you have to do this. It's simply a habit that Craig has that works for him. Ultimately, this video is a set of options for you as you learn to be more attractive in conversation. Model Craig in whichever way seems most fun to you until you've built the habit of dropping your filter, having fun, and finding people you genuinely enjoy flirting with and being around. Now, that said, there's a lot going on in this video and building new habits can be hard. It can be tough to remember to put any of this into practice, especially if you're speaking with someone who makes you nervous. That's why we put together our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step 30-day program that tells you exactly what to do every day to take what you're learning and turn it into unthinking habit. So by the end of the program, you radiate confidence and charisma naturally without even thinking about it. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. Life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event that I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. This next guy improved both his social life and career. He says, I had just moved to a new city for work after college. I always had trouble interacting with people outside of my hobbies and social circle, and it was even more difficult to connect with people while working from home. By sticking with Charisma University, I've had the confidence to make groups of new friends and land a promotion. CU has changed the way I see people and connect with others, and I am truly thankful for that. And this last one comes from a guy who's been making new relationships. Before going through Charisma University, I didn't know how to bring energy to a group, and I was terrible at meeting new people. Everything in my life has improved after CU, from loving myself and others more to creating and developing amazing relationships. The program is literally guaranteed to change your life. That means you can take the entire course, and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund from right inside the program. If you want to see if Charisma University is right for you, click the link on screen now or in the description below. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video, I really appreciate you taking the time to watch it, and I hope to see you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 627}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"If you're like me, this guy probably started filling up your YouTube homepage within the last year starting with insane challenges like reading every defined word in the dictionary for 17 hours or saying Logan Paul's name 100,000 times. ... If you're not familiar, that guy is MrBeast and he's seen extreme popularity on YouTube as of late. When I first saw those challenges, I have to admit I was jealous of how quickly he blew up on the platform so I decided to find out just how you, too, can become an overnight success the MrBeast way and what I found has actually been incredibly inspiring so here are five principles that have made MrBeast a wild success and can do the same for you. Step number one to becoming an overnight success — put in the work for longer than any casual fan could possibly realize. In fact, work at your craft for years without recognition. Yeah, this one sounds like a bummer at first but I've studied lots of people who blew up quickly from Justin Bieber to the Paul brothers to the Walmart yodeling kid and what I found is that they almost all spend years honing their craft before they break through and not just a few years. In fact, how many of his 15 million subscribers do you think that MrBeast had amassed after two years and nearly 500 videos? Take a guess at how many subs you think he had at that point. Got it? Well, here is the answer. I've been doing YouTube for about two years now and I'm approaching 1,000 subscribers which is pretty awesome. That's right — 1,000 subscribers after two years. So principle number one is to stop trying to find shortcuts and start practicing unless, of course, you're banking on reality TV stardom because I actually think this breaks the rule that applies to every other facet of life. Now, to be clear, it's not just sticking with it that leads to success. This is one area that people get confused in because they think persistence means doing the same tactic over and over despite never seeing any improvement or recognition. That is insane. The style of video was not going to hack it, for instance, for MrBeast. Sorry, man. I can't hang out. I got to edit a video. Dude, if you don't want to hang out, just tell me. You don't have to make up excuses. I do want to hang out. It's just I didn't upload yesterday and I really have to make a video and who am I kidding? I don't have friends. You need to keep your dream alive but to try a variety of different approaches to actually make it come true. Listen to just some of the phases that MrBeast's channel went through. I'm like, oh, people want to watch this stuff so I started uploading more Minecraft and then I got bored of Minecraft. I went back to Battle Pirates, that stupid Facebook game. I started uploading that. Then I started playing Call of Duty again. I started uploading that. And then when I had around 7,000 subscribers, I quit video games. I haven't played video games in like half a year and I now upload IRL videos because Call of Duty commentators are like a dime a dozen. 90% of those phases were short-lived and usually lasted about a month for MrBeast. In fact, that is a critical key. You are going to need to abandon perhaps 90% of your tactics quickly as soon as it becomes clear that they aren't getting traction. And I have a video on learning 10 times faster that goes into more detail about how to know if they are getting traction or not. I only wish that I had learned that lesson faster with Charisma on Command. I spent three years writing blog posts and doing in-person coaching before trying YouTube and seeing success on a larger scale. The key was not to confuse a broken tactic like blogging in my case with my dream of running a business that I was truly invested in. So if you do have a dream, define the essence of it and do not confuse your current tactics with the overall dream. That is a surefire way to slow yourself down or actually never to get there. And that leads to the third point and a major one. When you're deciding what your next project will be and one option looks like a faster route and the other is something that truly interests you, go with the one that interests you because both are going to require way more effort than you imagine. And most people will not put in years for a project that was only chosen because it was supposed to be easy. Pick something that you would do for free because you probably will for quite some time. In fact, an excellent question to ask yourself if you haven't identified anything that you're passionate about yet is, what do I currently pay to do or what am I doing right now for free? These are the things that you will be motivated to pursue even when the paycheck isn't instantaneous. Moving along, the next unique thing about MrBeast is that he really does make his content about other people. He promotes PewDiePie like crazy going so far as to buy billboards, go on radio shows to promote him, and it doesn't appear to be a simple marketing stunt. He continues to post about PewDiePie on his Twitter and had this to say when Jake Paul surprised him at his own house. Bro, I'm down. What are you... You want me to come in? Actually, before you come in, I just realized something. If they're going to enter this house, I need to promote PewDiePie. Please subscribe to PewDiePie, Ballard, Jake's. Alright, now that I've promoted... You know what they're called. You call them... In addition to consistently promoting some of his favorite YouTubers, MrBeast's friends have also become some of the main characters in many of his videos and what is almost so obvious that it doesn't even need to be said if you've seen his content is that MrBeast gives away a lot of money, literally over a million dollars in total, and he was not born rich. Now, I do believe this is truly because he's a generous guy and wants to make incredible content and this is truly incredible content but you can't ignore that promotion spent on others can sometimes be more effective than promotion spent on yourself. In addition to being a much more surprising story than spending on your own ads, for instance, helping others engages the natural human tendency towards reciprocity. Now, this is no guarantee but when it does work, it can be huge and gets you shout outs and sort of recognition that would be impossible to get through just paying for it. God bless you, MrBeast. God bless your soul. MrBeast, you saved my life. I owe you my life. Thank you. Okay, if you haven't watched the video yet, check it out. Link in the description. God bless you, MrBeast. This also ties to the last point which is that MrBeast takes his earnings and doesn't just spend it on his own enjoyment first. Instead, he continually invests in growth. Now, this kind of deferred earning is extremely hard. Imagine working at something for five, six years, finally getting a sizable check from a sponsor and then pushing it right back into the next video with no guarantee that people would even watch it. Now, that is what MrBeast essentially did and he did it when he gave $50,000 away to Ninja, for instance. Now, that doesn't necessarily lead to short-term financial gain and it didn't in MrBeast's case. Listen to this. I've given away almost half a million dollars in like the last 100 days. I don't even have a half a million dollars to my name. I literally am running myself dry but it's because I really enjoy it. I get a brand deal. I give it away to Twitch streamers. I gave my 3 million subscriber 3 million pennies, 30 grand, not even a brand deal, just out of my pocket just because it's fun. I think you make a great point. That's right. If MrBeast had just pocketed the money, he would have been better off. But if there's anything that you can learn from MrBeast, it's that he isn't in the short-term gain because in the long term, this has been a brilliant financial decision. 38 million views with two ad breaks is worth more than the 50,000 that he gave away to Ninja and that's true for almost all of his videos. But the discipline to continually invest with no guarantee that you're going to make it back, that takes huge guts and steadfast dedication to playing the long game. And it doesn't stop. Right now, MrBeast is spending more money on his fans as part of a marketing promotion. So yeah, guys, these four random people bought merch during the month of January so we flew them out to compete in a video and they all won money. And now that this contest is over, I'd like to announce our next contest. Starting now, random people that interact with the shopmrbeast.com website whether it's through your email or through buying merch will receive a golden ticket. If you receive a golden ticket, you're special and over these next couple of videos, you're going to see lots of clips of me talking to the people with the golden tickets and let's just say I'm going to be paying top dollar to get them back. That is more upfront cost. He is sacrificing the maximization of profits today to build a sustainable brand that people trust and love. And if this video teaches you just one thing, I hope it is that we are all in the long-term game. Like it or not, you will be reaping the results of your actions ten years from now. And if you focused on short-term money grabs, you'll probably still be running those hustles without much growth. Instead, I'd recommend on focusing on the five principles covered in this video starting today. And in a few years, when people talk about your overnight success, hopefully, you will remember the day that it really started. If you want more on similar topics of success, check out the video I did on Elon Musk who is obviously massively successful himself. I also made a video on Steve Jobs early in the life of this channel that I think is one of the most underrated videos in terms of content so if those interest you, go ahead and give those a look now. Either way, I hope that you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 547}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"When it comes to fast wits, few people can beat an improv comedian. Sadly, we've run out of time. We haven't run out of time, Tim. Time continues. Yeah. Christmas elves strike chants. Hey, hey. Ho, ho. We will not be paid in snow. Hey, hey. Ho, ho. We will not be paid in snow. And while beating that speed is hard, you can implement just a few basic habits to make people think that you are much wittier than you actually are in normal conversation. First off, most people always communicate in a way that the person that they're speaking with anticipates and expects. But purposely misinterpreting your conversational partner on occasion will make you come across as much funnier. For instance, watch Brennan misinterpret a question he clearly understands by taking it overly literally. Brennan, are there any holes in your underwear? Yes. The factory that made it put a hole in the front for my d**k. No, that's not what I mean. And as a side note, Brennan also demonstrates a point we'll return to later, which is expanding on the bit rather than letting it die after just one punchline. Is it false or true, machine? Take the point away. No, no, that is incorrect. I'm sorry. I did lie. There's three morals. One for my torso and two more for my legs. That's correct. You are not God. The machine is. One way to put this into practice in your life is to make sure to answer some of the basic questions that you get often non-literally. So when asked about your profession, you might say that you are a pro xylophone player. Or if you're in school, you can say that you study decorative soap making. Here's Russell Brand doing that with a question that he must have gotten all the time. Your hair is quite unusual. And in all the photographs, it looks quite wild and sometimes insane. How do you get your hair to look like that? My hair's held up mostly by willpower. Willpower? Really? I just concentrate and wish it to be so. This habit also works especially well when you're telling a story or listing something out. Most of the way through, you can switch from answering sincerely to purposely misinterpreting the question like Tom Cruise does here when asked about what licenses he has for all the stunts that he does. How many different licenses do you have? I mean, I have airplanes, commercial license, jets, a bunch of different airplanes, motorcycles, parachutes, boats, I have my real estate license. Now, when you purposely misinterpret, socially adept people will banter back which takes us to the next point and that is creating improv scenes. Yes, that's what comedians do on stage but it's also what friends do when they ping pong back and forth imagining a fake world that makes them both laugh. Here's an example that may remind you of your own friend group. Now it feels like you're about to do an ad for like some kind of tabletop specific like electrolyte infused beverage. Yeah, you gotta say hydrating your gaming table, that's why nerd water. Playing out these scenes is an incredibly fast way to turn an acquaintance into a friend and the good news is that if they don't come totally natural to you, there are three keys that will immediately punch up your wit in these scenarios. First off, when someone cracks a joke, don't just laugh and move on. Expand on it by pretending that the joke premise is real. Watch this interaction between Conan and Russell Brand to see how Russell's expansion on Conan's premise creates a super fun moment of banter. My god, what goes on in your booth? Never mind him, now. I will take you to freedom. Quiet! No one should be forced to live like this! Second, if it makes sense for the fake world you're making up, add a character with a unique voice. Having just one of these up your sleeve can make anything funnier. I have been using Eric Cartman to great effect for years. And yes, you can steal several from Brennan Lee Mulligan who has a million you can take inspiration from. The casino is the Andalusian. The vault underneath it has more than 40 million dollars on hand at any given night. Right, Ebeneezer Scrooge. You're going to Cahamadon! Ah, you bastard man! An egghead is preparing to break curfew and sneak out of the house to go to a party and you said that she's not allowed to leave. Third, add specificity. That means that when you wind up bantering back and forth in a scene, use words that are uncommon in normal vocabulary but make sense to that world. I didn't think you were coming in that close. Eventually, we would merge. What, you and I? Well, if we just kept moving closer and closer to each other, Andy could hug us into one glorious ectoplasm of man. This is where the biggest laughs often come in. Check out here how Brennan's use of the word hirelings does it. You know, like, if you were watching Lord of the Rings and, you know, Samwise is like, I can't carry the ring, Master Frodo, but I can carry you! And, like, fails his strength check and, like, can't lift him. Go back to town and get some hirelings and they can carry you! Now, if this feels like a lot to keep track of, don't. Focus just on being playful and non-literal and then, of course, adding a character with a voice and the rest often comes naturally. Here's what this looks like when all three come together effortlessly. Something f***ed up in the fact that all the orcs are cockney and all the elves are RP. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there is. Why can't we have some orc being like, I do say I love to destroy the world's men. Sorry, Solomon. Oh, sorry is on the phone. Or, and conversely, why can't we have an elf be like, look, there's a couple of things I love. I love, even though I love a nice bottle of wine. Like, why not? Now, all the things that we listed will help you with your improv scenes but to get anywhere near Brennan's level of speed and wit, you have to practice something called lowering your filter. That's when you would allow yourself to speak whatever is on your mind even if you think it's not interesting enough and yet you still back that up by speaking clearly and confidently. For example, watch this next clip where Brennan has just discovered that the game he's playing is rigged against him. Notice how he clearly doesn't know how he's going to connect what he's saying to the final point that he makes but he still speaks extremely powerfully without knowing where he's going. I highly recommend checking out the full clip which I will link to in the description. And if we check my point total here, I don't need to walk to the front because I know what it is. It's a big old goose egg, gang. It's a fat zero. Hello, a little late addition to the numerical symbol chart brought to us from our friends in Arabia. A little bit of trivia that I happen to know about the history of numbers. That kind of little tidbit would serve me well in most trivia games unless it had been rigged from the beginning. And yet, here we are. Introduced to the top of the game as a champion. What do you think that means? Icarus flying too close to the sun. But it seems Daedalus, our little master crafter over here, had some whack swings of his own, didn't he? Wanted to see his sun fall, fall from the sky. Oh, how close to the sun he flew. Well, I'm not having it. I've sold your labyrinth, Puzzle Master. Now, the best way to develop the skill of lowering your filter is by joining an improv comedy class in your area. It will take just a few classes before you are in the top 1% of people comfortable speaking without knowing where you're going. You'll be able to drop your inhibitions in the way that most people require alcohol to do, which makes you appear incredibly socially confident. But for some reason, if you can't join a class, you can get practice today just by setting a specific intention to say one more sentence than you normally would in every social interaction for the rest of today. So that's one more line to the cashier. Maybe commenting on the tabloids you see as you check out. And that's one more line to the person in your work elevator bank. Maybe noting that you haven't seen them around before. As you build this habit of speaking with a lower filter, you will find that wittier things just pop out without you knowing where they come from, just because you're not self-censoring so ruthlessly. Now, being quick on your feet and playing a character have been of particular interest to me lately because I just created a brand new Dungeons & Dragons show that is premiering on YouTube today. Brenna was actually a huge inspiration for it, hence this video. For those of you who don't know what I mean by Dungeons & Dragons, it's a comedy, improv, and storytelling game and I think ours came out amazing. It even has a hilarious Trump impersonator in it. You look at what these people are saying and they're talking about Dumpy, right? They're talking about Dumpy and you can tell. And that's you! That's me and you're excited about that, which is great. The first episode is up now and I highly recommend you check it out because it is a ton of fun and if you think D&D isn't for you, we added lots of artwork and even explainers to make it accessible to people who may never have heard of it before. So click the link here and watch now. Of course, let me know what you think in the comments. Either way, I hope that you enjoyed this video. Thank you to Brenna for the D&D inspiration and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 546}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"There is something inside every one of us that has the potential to ruin your life and that same thing also is the key to unlocking your full confidence and capability. You see it in Fight Club where Tyler Durden is simultaneously the most destructive, dangerous aspect of the narrator. I'm not killing anyone, man. We're setting him free. Bob is dead. They shot him in the head. You want to make an omelet, you got to break some eggs. And he's the most effortlessly confident and capable part of him. I want everybody out of here right now. Hey, you should join our club. So in this video, I want to break down the psychological reason that we all do this, the shadow, and I want to help you see the shadow pattern so that you can avoid sabotaging your career, your relationships, or any other area of your life. Welcome to Fight Club. First though, let's back up and talk about what the shadow is. The shadow was first identified by Carl Jung and it is the unconscious repressed aspects of your personality. These are the parts that are considered undesirable or socially unacceptable by your conscious mind. For instance, boys tend to be ridiculed for crying past a certain age so crying gets forced into their shadow. Did you shed tears in yourself? It's difficult for me to answer the question. You cried? There were tears that ran down my face but I did not cry. I mean, that's crying. And girls tend to be judged for expressing their anger directly so aggression gets put in the shadow. I love your skirt. Where did you get it? Uh, it was my mom's in the 80s. Vintage! So adorable. Thanks. That is the ugliest effing skirt I've ever seen. So we have these pieces of ourselves, pieces of the way that we naturally are that are not loved by the people around us. This is terrifying. We might be abandoned if the people around us don't love us for who we are. What am I afraid of? What the fuck am I afraid of? You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. So what do we do with small children? Well, we attempt to change who we are and we do that by cutting off and repressing the pieces that aren't loved. So boys, stop crying. Girls, stop yelling. As a man, you're gonna feel like crying. It's gonna happen but what you're supposed to do is not cry because this is a test in mental fortitude. And we convince the people around us and ourselves that we aren't sad or angry anymore and we are praised for it. Now, you run this over and over again with sadness, anger, fear, sexuality, whatever isn't acceptable and you create a whole layer of a personality on top of who you really are. Like so many others, I had become a slave to the Ikea nesting instant. This is the birth of the persona, your mask. It is the sum of all of your acceptable parts. This is the way that you think you are. Persona is the you that you present when you want people to accept and like you. It's also the birth of the shadow. The shadow is all of those rejected and unloved parts of you. These are all the ways that you think that you are not. Now, most people believe that our shadow traits can be destroyed through discipline. You could be brilliant but you're a coward. Now, stop saying that. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Stop being so weak. You are a worthless, friendless, little piece of sh** whose mommy left daddy when she figured out he wasn't Eugene O'Neal. You yell at a child or withdraw from them and you change them. The anger or the sadness or the fear or their sexuality just goes away. That's good parenting at least that most people think about it but this is Carl Jung's brilliant insight. The shadow doesn't actually go away. Sure, the outward behavior — the yelling and that crying — may stop but that doesn't mean that the anger or the sadness disappears. We just lose conscious awareness of those things and that means that at one level, we still have these feelings of sadness or anger but because they're not fully felt, those feelings begin to run our lives unconsciously. Now, I know this can all sound very complicated like, how can sadness be running my life if I never even cry or feel sad? Well, this is where defense mechanisms kick in. You're lecturing me on life? Look at you, you f*****g burnout. What winds your clock? A defense mechanism is an unconscious psychological strategy that protects you from challenging emotions like those emotions in the shadow and there are several defense mechanisms so I'm just going to lay out a few of them that are the most common ones that I see. First, you have sublimation where we channel those shadow emotions into socially acceptable forms. Guys like me, if it wasn't fighting, I would be in jail. Like, it's not like — you don't understand. Like, I truly have a deep down urge to kill someone. Like, I can't — it doesn't go away. You also have rationalization where we logically explain how we don't really have shadow behaviors and for an example, you can take Martha Stewart here. She clearly sees cheating as unacceptable when describing her husband's affairs. If you're married and you think you're happily married and your husband starts to cheat on you, he's a piece of s**t. And look at him, it's a piece of s**t and get out of it. Get out of that marriage. But when confronted with her own infidelity, which happened first, she has rationalizations of why that doesn't count. But what happened? You had an affair. I had a very brief affair with a very attractive Irish man and it was just nothing. It was nothing. You also have dissociation where we can go numb and sometimes totally detached from our experiences. The most extreme cases would be dissociative identity disorder which we see play out in Fight Club and Moon Knight. Why do people think that I'm you? I think you know. No, I don't. Yes, you do. Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me? But it can also just look like periods of general numbness and poor memory. If you don't remember important chunks of your childhood, dissociation is likely at play. And then you have the one that I personally just find the most interesting. This is projection where we spot the unacceptable feeling in someone else and it triggers us. This is what's going on when you see all these anti-gay people getting busted in homosexual relationships. I'll do a whole video on this because there is a ton to say about it so let me know if you're interested. But the common factor with any defense mechanism is that we don't actively consciously choose them. They all just seem to happen to us and we tend to defend our defense mechanisms intensely because if we were to lose those defense mechanisms, we'd have to come into direct contact with our shadow. All this time, I thought I was the original but I'm just something that you made up. Say it. Because we're the same person. Now, we need to pause here to make clear that these coping strategies, these defense mechanisms, work really, really well. Most of the world is unaware of their own shadow so almost no one is going to catch on to yours. In fact, most of the world will encourage you to keep sublimating, rationalizing, dissociating from, and projecting your shadow because if you stop, they might have to face their own and that is way too threatening. So most people make it through their 20s fully repressing their shadow and honestly, it works just fine for them. What I've noticed though is that if you don't start integrating your shadow in your 30s, problems tend to arise. In my case, my unaddressed fear of being alone manifested in me having a ton of money stolen and it never would have happened if I'd integrated that fear. You can check out the video that I made on the topic if you want more of the details. So by your mid-30s, you can expect to see some major issues cropping up like consistent business struggles or difficulty in relationships, things just feeling off even when the outside world is going well if you haven't started integrating your shadow. And if you don't address it by 40 or later, you may be in store for a full-blown midlife crisis which will confuse you because you have done everything that you're supposed to. You've become everything you're supposed to but at some level, you can't stand rejecting aspects of yourself anymore. This is where the shadow takes over, acts out, and destroys what you've built. Think of that new young wife that the middle-aged man gets or the risky business investment that bankrupts him. The thing that obviously won't make you feel better but you just can't say no to and I believe this is exactly what happened with Will Smith. After years of being the good-spirited, happy, understanding guy, Will Smith turned the biggest professional accomplishment of his career into a near career ender when he slapped Chris Rock. This was obviously triggered by a joke but the real cause was years of repressing his frustration and smiling through boundary violations. I would say don't just start filming me without asking me. I got into an entanglement with August, that's what I said. An entanglement? Yes. Every time he didn't stand up for himself came out in that one moment. So what do you do to avoid a massive meltdown in your own life? Well, I've mentioned the word integration a few times and that means instead of running from the shadow which just lets it run your life from the background like my hidden anxiety or Will Smith's slap, you turn and face the shadow. You integrate it back into who you are, who you see yourself to be. In the words of Carl Jung, until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate so you make the unconscious conscious. This means that you're going to have to feel all of those feelings that you split off into the unconscious shadow. Oftentimes, that means decades of repressed anger, grief, and shame. Now, I won't sugarcoat this. This is hard work. It is not a surprise that most people postpone it or avoid it indefinitely. But as you begin to feel those feelings through therapy, dream work, free writing, breath work, there's tons of options. You can develop what seem like superpowers because the shadow doesn't just actually contain things that are going to ruin your life. So when you get into a conscious relationship with your own shadow, you actually unlock your full potential. Your intuition comes online and you're able to make brilliant decisions with almost no effort. Your relationships get so much more fulfilling or end as your standards will naturally rise. Your confidence shifts from being based on external approval, which is shaky, to being based on internal alignment, which is untouchable by the outside world. So many of the things that took work become easy because you did the real work of integrating your shadow, of becoming whole internally. So you skip all kinds of self-sabotage that will bring down others and actually live up to your full potential. Now, I am working on a video on the steps to embrace the warrior aspect of your shadow so if you'd like to make sure that you see that when it comes out, make sure to subscribe and hit that notification bell.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all had conversations that feel forced or boring or are filled with awkward silences. It can be almost painful like this next clip. Do you like country music or... Do you like country? Yeah. Cool. So in this video, we're going to go over five steps to make small talk with anyone. We'll do so by breaking down some tricks that Joe Rogan uses on his podcast to connect with everyone from academics to athletes to celebrities. Some will be mindsets and some will be word-for-word questions you can steal. These habits are a big reason why so many of Joe's conversations end like this. Bob Saget, I love you. I love you, Joe. Thank you, buddy. Thank you. It was a lot of fun. This was great. This was great, man. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. I really enjoyed this, man. I really enjoyed it. Tell people... I always appreciate you, man. I really do. Thanks, and I really appreciate you, too. Most people have their guard up when they first meet you. They aren't sure if you're going to be competitive or try to put them down in some way. So the first trick you can steal from Joe is to grease the wheels early with a compliment. This isn't something you have to do to make a small talk go well, but it helps you start the conversation with a positive vibe. There's a lot of potential compliments you could give someone. That said, there's three easy types you can focus on for small talk. Their work, their energy, or a platonic physical compliment. With those three options, you should be able to compliment almost anyone you meet. Here's a quick example of each. Thank you very much for being here. I'm a really big fan, so this is an honor. I love being around people like you. My guy. People around you... People like you, you're going for shit all the time. And it's infectious. It's like you give off energy. Cheers, brother. Nice to meet you. Good to meet you, too. By the way, congrats on the mustache. The mustache, lower piece combo. That's the anarchist guy with that guy that... Who's the mask? Guy Fawkes. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Perfect, right? People make three common mistakes when giving compliments that you'll want to avoid. The first is making the compliment too sexual. Second is making a compliment you don't mean, which makes you seem manipulative. The third is dwelling on the compliment. A compliment is great, but especially with people of high status who hear compliments all the time, you'll want to transition off of it fairly quickly. In general, transitioning off of an introduction and into an interesting conversation is one of the hardest parts of small talk. The best way to do this is by transitioning between topics using reminds-me-of thinking. For example, with Josh Barnett, Joe starts the conversation in his standard way by complimenting his beard. How long you been growing that f***er? That's a real one. That's a man's beard. After Josh responds, Joe does what most people would do and starts talking about his own hair, but very quickly he uses that to toss out a new potential topic. Probably like 35, I started growing like serious back hair. I'm not like... Who's that Russian wrestler dude? Is this one? Oh, well, there was this guy, Viktor Zangiev, who actually did professional wrestling, and that guy was just coated in it. Oh, yeah, right. There was another guy, Salman Hashimakov. Most people make the mistake of thinking very linearly during small talk, so they'd simply comment on their own hair and then stare over at you hoping that you would take the conversation somewhere interesting. Just by tossing out that his back hair reminds him of a Russian wrestler, Joe and Josh are able to spend the next four minutes talking about various wrestlers and MMA fighters. It's a simple habit to build and makes a huge difference in the quality of your small talk. Here's another quick example with Rob Lowe. Rob asked Joe a question about baseball, which Joe doesn't seem interested in talking about. Most people here would just say something like, no, not really, and let the conversation stall. Instead, Joe uses lateral thinking to transition to something else. Are you a fan of the baseball with the crowd noise? Pipe-tuned crowd noise? No, I'm not a fan of fake noise. I hate that some cars do that. They put fake engine noise through the speakers? Oh, Jesus. Exactly. Because he didn't just answer the question, but instead asked himself what fake sound in a baseball stadium reminds him of, they were able to transition to cars, a topic it turns out they both love. So next time you're in conversation and can't think of anything to say, it's as simple as asking yourself, what does this remind me of? And then branch off in whatever direction first comes to your mind. In both those cases, you see another common habit of Joe's. He pings for topics of mutual interest. Joe is infamous for doing this by bringing up DMT in every conversation. DMT, DMT, DMT, DMT, DMT, DMT, DMT, DMT. When a guest doesn't know what it is, it just goes by the wayside. But when they do, it's an immediate connection. This will keep you genuinely interested in the conversation. Joe is a master at doing this in the other direction as well. He has two tricks to get other people excited about the conversation. They're both super easy to do, but most people don't do them, which is why small talk feels so painful at times. For example, here's a common small talk conversation. Where are you from originally? I'm from Wilmington, Delaware. Wilmington, Delaware. I don't know many people from Delaware. Thank you. Yeah. What is Wilmington like? Nice town? Yeah, it's great. Where are you from? Is it nice there? These are boring questions that no one is going to be excited to answer unless they already like you. It's very similar, but watch what Joe asks instead. Why Utah, man? Why do you live in Utah? What's that about? Joe peels the onion. He goes one level deeper by asking why questions that get someone talking about what they value. This may seem hard to work into a conversation, but it's actually quite simple. You just do it in two phases. Where do you live? That's cool. Why do you live there? What do you do for work? Interesting. Why did you decide to do that? Even if the person doesn't love where they live, you'll get to hear what's important to them. Maybe it's their job, their family, a passion, whatever it is, now you know what's important to them and can ask a question about that, which they're much more likely to want to talk about. This ties directly into the second trick Joe uses. He asks questions that are fun to answer. For example, an issue you might run into with small talk is that some people don't have anything interesting going on in their lives to share about. One way to get them past that block is to ask a fun question that removes the constraint of having to be realistic. Here's a few examples. If you had a magic wand and someone said, you could do whatever you want to fix this, what would you do? If you were the king of the world, you said, Ed, what are we going to do? Let's say you become president. Pulling both tricks together, a great decision tree of questions to get an interesting conversation going can be, what do you do? Then as a follow-up, do you like it? If they say yes, you can ask why and elicit their values. If they say no, you can ask, well, if you had a hundred million dollars, what would you do instead? Joe also has two habits for creating a connection with people while listening. The first is he laughs easily. This makes it more fun to talk to him because it makes you feel good for being funny, even when you aren't trying to be. For instance, watch him react when Elon Musk's talks about selling flamethrowers through the boring company. How many did you make? 20,000. And they're all gone. Here's another example where Joe laughs at what Dan Bilzerian is saying, even though Dan isn't trying to make a joke. And I was single and I was just like, you know what, f**k it. I'm just kind of kind of like do bucket list s**t. Like whatever, like whatever I wanted to do when I was a kid, I'm just going to f**king do it. He's able to find humor in the absurd. And in both cases, you see the other person light up a bit as they get a laugh from Joe. For another example, watch David Blaine's big smile after he accidentally makes Joe laugh. Yeah, but it's choked out of euphoric. Right. Yeah, exactly. Except this one's even better. And then you have all these dreams. No, it's not exciting. The goal here is not to fake laugh. What you want to do is allow yourself to laugh every time you find something funny. Laughing is a habit that gets easier the more you do it. So if you struggle to laugh when you're out with friends or in conversation with strangers, a good habit is to watch something you know will make you laugh right before going out. This will help you be in a better state to laugh in conversation. The second habit Joe has when listening is mirroring. There's several ways to mirror, but Joe's is most similar to ex-FBI negotiator Chris Voss' method. The mirroring that I teach is much more simplistic and interestingly enough, has a great impact on how the other person interacts with you. And it's just repeating the last one to three words that they've said, word for word, one to three words, or it's repeating a selected one to three words. Here's a quick example where he mirrors to make you feel heard. It's not like I want to, like, take over the world. I just want to, like, make a good living doing what I love. That's all I want, you know, and it's f***ing hard. I know it's hard. Here's a different example. This time, he mirrors to build rapport with Jordan Peterson before taking control of the conversation. Don't do this after every sentence, but if you find you want to make someone feel heard or you want to interrupt without making the person feel ignored, mirror their last three words. Also, it's worth noting while Joe does mirror people's words, he is not a chameleon. He stays true to himself and his style. For instance, Jordan Peterson is a polite guy who wears a suit and chooses his words carefully, but you just saw Joe chatting with him in a hoodie, dropping F-bombs in the first minute. So you want to mirror someone's last few words as a quick hack to build a bit of rapport, but you don't want to copy everything about someone. Stay true to yourself and have confidence in who you are. If that's something you'd like more help with, I think the fastest way to build true social confidence in yourself in a meaningful way is with our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in 30 days. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below, but I figure the strongest way to let you know what it's all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written in. The first is from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, Another person wrote in about their social life saying, And this last one is from someone who says it's been life-changing. You'll see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. I make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it and I'd love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 661}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"It seems to be harder than ever to get through to people logically. In fact, some of the smartest people have the most sophisticated psychological booby traps when it comes to heated subjects. So in this video, we are going to break down why sometimes people won't listen to reason even when they're smart and what techniques you can do to finally get through to those people so that they see the light. The first thing that you need to realize is that people can fall into a pit that makes them impervious to reasoned argument. What pushes them into that pit is called cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is the state of having thoughts, actions, beliefs, or desires that are inconsistent with one another. The classic example is someone who smokes, knows that smoking kills, yet says that they want to live a long healthy life. Their beliefs and their actions don't seem to match up. Now, having one's own cognitive dissonance pointed out is uncomfortable. That's because there's often an unspoken cost to changing certain actions or opinions. In this case, stopping smoking would lead to painful withdrawals. So the most common way that people make cognitive dissonance more bearable is by sneakily changing another thought or action, even if that one makes them irrational. That means that our smoker who can't quit only has irrational paths out of cognitive dissonance. They may point to individuals who smoked without consequence, insist that they have the healthiest genes, or say that they don't care if they die early even when they really do. The big takeaway is that sometimes, especially in politics, religion, or emotional life choices, the most ridiculous belief that we have is the one that is most difficult to change. That is why smart people cling to silly positions. It's also why it's critical that you recognize cognitive dissonance if you're ever going to get through to those people because the worst thing that you can do in moments where people are deep in a cognitive dissonance shutdown is to continue with logical argument. That will just drive them deeper into irrationality. So here are seven tells that someone is going into a cognitive dissonance shutdown and you need to tread carefully. Keep in mind that none of these are perfect indicators. There are times when each tell is entirely reasonable but if you see several tells, it's likely you're encountering cognitive dissonance. Also, my intent here is not to make fun of the people in these examples just to learn from them because we all get caught up in cognitive dissonance from time to time. So the first indicator is being stunned by new information without conceding or adjusting your perspective. Take, for example, Kathy Newman after she had asked Jordan Peterson about why he feels that he has the right to offend people in the pursuit of truth. You're doing what you should do which is digging a bit to see what the hell's going on. It's exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me. You haven't sat there and... I'm just trying to work that out. I mean... Ha, gotcha. You have got me. You have got me. I'm trying to work that through my head. Yeah, yeah. It took a while. It took a while. It did. It did. When someone is stunned, it means that they encountered surprising new information and to not adjust one's perspective based on that new information can point towards cognitive dissonance. But I repeat that that alone is not enough on its own which is why you should pay attention for number two, being unable to accurately summarize the other side's perspective and this is often preceded by, so you're saying. You're saying that trans activists... But you're saying... So you're saying that anyone who believes in equality... So you're saying give people equality of opportunity, that's fine. We see Ben Affleck do this in his conversation with Sam Harris when Sam is critical of aspects of the doctrine of Islam. We have been sold this meme of Islamophobia where every criticism of the doctrine of Islam gets conflated with bigotry toward Muslims as people. You're saying that Islamophobia is not a real thing. Now this needs to be contrasted with summarizing the other side's perspective in a way that genuinely attempts to portray them in their own words. This is to be encouraged and you can see Jon Stewart do it here with Bill O'Reilly. Let me go to a different point, if I may. It sounds like what you're saying is, and correct me if I'm wrong, and I don't want to be wrong when I'm with you because you know I got mad love for you, that's a rap phrase. I got it. The third tell is mind-reading the other side's intent especially when the intent is presumed to be nefarious. Ben Shapiro made this mistake in his conversation with Andrew Neil assuming that Andrew must be on the left because he asked him pointed questions. Ben continued to disbelieve Andrew even when Andrew had indicated that Ben had misread his intent. You as a journalist are proceeding to call one side of the political aisle ignorant, barbaric, and sending us back to the dark ages. Why don't you just say that you're on the left? Is this so hard for you? Why can't you just be honest? Seriously, it's a serious question. Mr. Shapiro, if you only knew how ridiculous that statement is, you wouldn't have said it. So let's move on. I think it's pretty evident from your own questions exactly what you are, sir. The fourth tell is regularly moving goalposts. It's, of course, okay to clarify your position but if you notice that someone is regularly adjusting the criteria by which they judge an argument, you're likely witnessing cognitive dissonance. For context, in this next clip, Stewart and O'Reilly are arguing whether it reflects poorly that Barack Obama had Common to the White House given that Common has defended someone accused of killing a police officer. Jon Stewart points out that Springsteen, Bono, and Bob Dylan also did the same thing and we get this exchange. Wait, let me reply. Okay, so you say that because Bono, Springsteen, and Bob Dylan wrote songs defending people who were accused of heinous things that I have to give Common a pass because he did the same thing. You have to be consistent with your outrage. Let me give you— Be consistent. I will. Common visited, went to see— The fifth tell is yelling or getting angry, especially self-righteous anger and you just saw it with Bill O'Reilly a bit but here's another example from Ben Affleck and Sam Harris. For context, while Ben does make good points that most Muslims are good human beings, he's not responding to Sam's criticisms at all. You can hear Sam try to explain his actual position but he can't get through because of the yelling. How about the more than a billion people who aren't fanatical, who don't punch women, who just want to go to the store— Wait a second, Sam. Wait a second. Wait a second. Don't do any of the things that you're saying all Muslims— Wait a second. I'm not saying all Muslims— And you're painting the whole group religion with that— No, no, let's— The sixth tell of cognitive dissonance is attacking someone's character instead of addressing their arguments and it's often a sign in light of a losing argument. This is a last resort. ...who you are in terms of your group identity. You're just saying those things, though, to provoke, aren't you? I mean, you are a provocateur. You're like the alt-right that you hate to be compared to. You want to stir things up— And seven is retreating from a point without any concession. This is the least of the giveaway since there's often good reasons to move on in an argument but it should be noted, nonetheless, especially if someone retreats rather hastily to move along. ...for humor, now and then. I'm not interested in provoking. But what about the thing about, you know, fighting and the lobster? Tell us about the lobster. Well, that's quite a segue. If you see two, three, or more of these signs, stop debating. Stop with logical arguments because they will not get you anywhere. You are in the midst of dangerous cognitive dissonance. Instead, your first order of business should be to re-establish rapport with the person you're communicating with. We've covered this at length in our videos on Crowder and Trevor Noah which I'll link to for a thorough breakdown of rapport but for the fastest effect, mid-conversation, crack a joke that does not insult the other side like this. This is kind of fun, though, is it not? Yeah, it's delightful. And my frustration is not with you. Again, it's watching the entire system. You loathe the network but you kind of loathe me a little less. I got it. No, no, no. I don't even loathe you. Let's talk politics. I actually enjoy your company. I feel like we should get together outside of this weirdly egg-shaped table. Good nature jokes are especially effective because cognitive dissonance is like a shell that prevents new information from coming in. As long as you are perceived as a threat, the other person's shell will stay up. But if you signal that you're not a threat by making someone laugh, they will feel safe enough to finally open back up. Once the other side has opened back up, you're going to have to employ three counterintuitive mindsets to finally get them to listen. First, demonstrate no superiority if they switch to your side. When you rub winning an argument in people's faces, they will slip back into cognitive dissonance. If your aim is to change someone's mind, you need to resist the urge to do things like this. You talk a lot about the Pareto distribution, yes? That doesn't mean I defend it. Well, okay. No, not well, okay. Yes. Second, do not force people to immediately live out their new values. Our hypothetical smoker is going to have a really hard time conceding that smoking is ruining their health if they're forced to quit cold turkey in that same breath. So you need to allow people space to separate honesty from integrity. Third, do not hold past inconsistencies against people. People have a strong desire to defend things that they've said and done in the past. So when you bring up those inconsistencies, it can drive them to abandon the new belief that they're trying out just so that they can remain consistent with their past selves. But all of this stuff is worth only so much if you use it just with conversation with others because the most dangerous cognitive dissonance you will ever encounter is your own. Your cognitive dissonance is what makes you the smart person with some dumb opinions and we all have some. Now, admittedly, spotting cognitive dissonance in yourself is harder though the seven tells can tip you off if you have super high self-awareness. And the solution of allowing yourself to crack a joke, forgive your past inconsistencies, will help you move through cognitive dissonance gracefully. But there is one more piece that helps the most with your own person and that's when you feel yourself losing track of an argument, you start to raise your voice, or you just get the sense that you're trying to win instead of learn or communicate, connect with your body. Literally, look downward into your chest, placing a hand on your heart or belly, and take a deep breath. Cognitive dissonance often feels like panic if you tune into it which is why people enter fight-or-flight in those arguments. But when you slow down and you pay attention, you'll find that you're actually just having a discussion and exploring a perspective that may be more in line with reality and your sense of logic will start to come back to you. Now, if you can do this in real time, you won't just be part of the solution to communication breakdowns which is amazing in and of itself, you will see things that other people cannot see. You'll take your ego blinders off and be better prepared to succeed in politics, relationships, work, or life. If you don't do this, you'll find yourself in a near perpetual state of shock and outrage when the world doesn't match your predefined expectations and worse, you'll be poorly equipped to do anything to improve it.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Staying confident in embarrassing nerve-wracking situations can be tricky but unfortunately, those are the times you need your confidence the most. So in this video, we'll be using Margot Robbie to demonstrate five things that will make sure you stay confident even in situations where you might normally feel embarrassed or nervous. It's important to note that there is a two-way street between confidence and your actions meaning that feeling confident will obviously create confident behaviors but also, doing those behaviors even when you're nervous can make you feel more confident which is why they're so important to know. Now, the first thing is a general charisma tip. It's an obvious one but it can't be overlooked — you need to develop the habit of smiling more frequently. Margot smiles all the time when she's listening and importantly, when she speaks. You know what? The scene's not happening today. I'm just gonna eat this whole damn cake right now. And I hate the cake and we sat there and ate it and we're like, yeah, this is the best birthday ever. Now, we've talked about smiling on the channel many times before and it's probably not news to you but it is going to be especially important when you're nervous or caught in embarrassing situations. Smiling can save you because it signals first to your brain that things are okay which will make you feel more confident and it also makes everyone else around you assume that what happened wasn't actually all that embarrassing. To see the effect in action, first, watch this BBC interview. ...shifting sands in the region — do you think relations with the North may change? I would be surprised if they do. Pardon me. Notice how you feel about the man being interviewed. Maybe you feel embarrassed for him, maybe you don't but it's very unlikely that you found him charismatic. Now, contrast how he made you feel to Margot in this next clip. ...when was this taken? Literally, the most embarrassing photo of my whole life. My bet is that Margot probably left you with a much more positive impression which emphasizes a key point — people do not instantly judge you when embarrassing situations occur even though it sometimes feels that way. They judge you based on your handling of those situations so recognize that nothing is lost in embarrassing situations — at least, not initially. In fact, you have an opportunity to make people like you more based on your response. Keeping that in mind can help you to feel more confident in situations that previously mortified you. I'm mortified. I'm so embarrassed. Now, at first, smiling and laughing embarrassment off may not come easily to you and if it doesn't, you don't have to fake it which takes us to our second point. If you can't laugh it off, at the very least, give yourself permission to be authentic and transparent in expressing your emotions when you're embarrassed. As we discussed before, we like people who can stay positive through embarrassment but if that isn't possible, we also like people who will be real in those situations which is why you'll see charismatic people seemingly overexpress in embarrassing moments. Maybe they put their head in their hands or they turn away in an exaggerated manner. For instance, watch here where Margot is caught stealing toilet paper from a hotel. We found the photo that the paparazzi took of you. Do you want to see? Tell me if this person is guilty of doing something wrong. Look at this guilty human being. The same principle of transparency applies to what we say. If you find yourself tongue-tied in embarrassing situations, often the best thing to do is simply to speak out loud your inner nervous dialogue like this. I'm sorry. I'm probably more nervous than you are, to be honest. Sorry, that's not comforting. I'm not going to say that. That wasn't very professional. I just thought of that. I'm so scared. I was going to say my hands are shaking but you don't want to hear that. It takes confidence to reveal discomfort but it also breeds confidence when you don't feel like there's something perfect that you have to say. Simply talking through your train of thought as embarrassment kicks in can be a way to get through, turn the tables, and put you back into a much more powerful feeling position. You can try the next time something that would make you nervous comes up. Just give your running mental dialogue a voice and when expressed with emotion, this also makes for an excellent hook to any story. After something like this, people will be sure to be paying close attention. I'm scared because my husband's going to kill me for telling this story but it's my favorite story ever. This connects well with our third point which is that leaning into embarrassment is the best way to minimize it and regain your confidence. Again, watch as this man on the BBC tries to pretend that the embarrassing situation isn't occurring. It makes him look rigid and hyper-concerned with his failing professional appearance. North Korea — South Korea's policy choices on North Korea have been severely limited. Margot, on the other hand, takes extra time to dwell on her embarrassing moments like here where she can't stop laughing at an awards ceremony. It's so funny, Margot. I don't know why it sounds so sexual to me. Open BD is available. Or here when she physically points to draw more attention to the embarrassing photo. The toilet paper right there. Look at that face. That is going to be like, uh, don't look in the bag, uh, don't look in the bag. Can you imagine if the bag broke and the toilet paper went everywhere? And in other cases, she does what you can do which is simply to spend more time elaborating on a particular embarrassing moment. I'm in bed. I'm clearly really enjoying myself reading Harry Potter. Yeah, you are. I have braces which I had for two years. We perceive this habit of leaning into embarrassment as charismatic because embarrassing moments naturally call people's attention. People want to spend time assessing and addressing those moments and when you try to lean away from those moments, perhaps by quickly suggesting another conversational topic, you will almost always lose your audience. Instead, you can take control of the situation with something called pacing and leading. First, pacing means allowing attention to go where it is naturally called. In this case, it's to that embarrassing thing. And then, once the audience is laughing and you've become that conversational leader, you can lead them to another topic. And when done in this way, people usually won't resist that change in topic. Now, there is another nice thing about slowing down and pacing an audience that wants to focus on your embarrassing moment and it's that that enables you to make jokes that get easy laughs further boosting your confidence. You can watch here as Marco tells her story of misspelling a tattoo that she gave on the cast of Suicide Squad particularly to a crew member. Notice how rather than try to race through the story, she jokes at her own expense afterwards. Everyone was spelling it as S-K-W-A-D but I went straight from the S to the W. Swad? But if you still want one... Now, the fourth point is one that will build confidence over time and it's that you actually break the golden rule. You treat other people in the opposite fashion to how I just described that you're going to treat yourself which means that instead of leaning into their embarrassing stories, you help other people escape their embarrassing moments while saving face. And you can see Marco do this here with Jimmy Fallon as he tells a story about a dorky date that he once took a woman on. Today, we're going to go ice skating together in Central Park. Is that your idea of a date? That's so sweet. Yeah, I think so. It's nice. I like that. Now, this definitely deserves a caveat because sometimes, people might enjoy laughing at their own embarrassing moments. They've achieved a distance from them and in those cases, it's fine to lean in and playfully tease someone who can take it. ...the face of a 20-year-old but the hearing of a 90-year-old. Should I say that again but louder? ... But generally speaking, if you see someone is uncomfortable and you don't take the time to pile on to their difficult moment, you're subconsciously asserting that you don't need to drag someone down in order to elevate yourself and this naturally boosts your confidence. So in those situations where someone does look a bit uncomfortable, see if you can find a way to see the positive or otherwise bail them out of that moment. But of course, all the habits here are ultimately to reinforce a mindset and the mindset that will most help you handle embarrassing situations with confidence and poise comes down to what question you're asking yourself when you become uncomfortable. And if the question that you ask yourself in those social scenarios is, how is my reputation being impacted by all this information? You're naturally going to have a difficult time with those embarrassing stories. You're going to try to escape them and most likely, you'll make things worse. But if you make your habitual question, what would make this moment more fun, you'll handle embarrassment much more confidently. Not only will you naturally exhibit all the habits that we covered here but you're signaling that you aren't identified with whatever dumb thing you may have done nor are you as strongly identified with what other people think of you in any given moment. And oddly enough, that makes people drawn to your authenticity even when you might feel nervous. Now, perhaps surprisingly, genuine authenticity can be a habit that's actually hard to develop but you absolutely can be yourself while still being charismatic and one of the resources that most helped me to work on that is called Radical Honesty. It is so good and so important that I've gone through Radical Honesty three times and lines like this still hit me right in the gut. We all lie like hell. It wears us out.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Henry Cavill loves roleplaying video games, and he isn't afraid to say so. Too many people mistakenly think that you need to hide any nerdy interest you have if you want to be seen as attractive. But that's not true at all. You know what will make you instantly seem unattractive? If someone gets the sense that you're trying to hide parts of yourself just to make them like you. Now, you don't have to make your nerdy hobbies the first thing you talk about, but if it comes up naturally, lean into it and own it. That said, the problem is most people don't know how to talk about their nerdy interests so that the other person finds them interesting. So let's get into some specifics, three easy tips to talk about your nerdy interests in a more attractive way. The first important thing to realize is that enthusiasm about anything is endearing. For example, watch this clip of Joe Manganiello talking about a moment from his past D&D game. For context, he's talking about stealing a powerful artifact for his character, the hand of an evil god. Watch for three things — his face lights up, he's smiling, and he emotes with his hands. When it comes to nerdy interests, the most common mistake people make is having a tone of voice or body language that projects embarrassment or shame. If you talk about something like you're embarrassed of it, the other person will assume it's embarrassing. Watch this next clip for a good example of the common cues that make someone think you're embarrassed — low volume, looking down, and hesitating when you speak. When you're talking, do the opposite. Allow your excitement about the topic to come through in your voice, your facial expressions, and your hand gestures. Now, enthusiasm is a great first step, but if you really want to hook someone, you have to learn how to make your interests interesting to them. One bad habit that makes it harder for you to connect with people is when they can't follow the details of what you're talking about. Here's a funny example with Ronda Rousey trying to talk about World of Warcraft with Conan. The easiest way to avoid this is to make your nerdy interests relatable. Avoid using jargon, and instead, relate your passion to something you know the person will understand. Here's an example of how Joe Manganiello first explained Dungeons and Dragons to his wife. The magic phrase for getting someone to appreciate why you like something is, it's like, followed by something you know they understand, and ideally, something they like. This will help form a connection between you, because you're pointing out how your interests aren't as dissimilar as they might appear. For instance, if you're trying to explain why you like League of Legends to someone who has no idea what it is, it might be helpful to lead with something like, it's a 5 on 5 team game you can play with friends, just like basketball, except it's a computer game you all play online. Will they instantly understand everything about the game? No, but they will start to understand why you like it and be able to relate to it in conversation. There's one more helpful trick you can use when you're talking about something and you aren't sure if the other person is into it. Give them chances to opt in or opt out. Ping for their interest, and if they seem intrigued, dive in. If not, don't force it. Now, if you're speaking with enthusiasm and making it relatable, you're way less likely to bore people, but you should still periodically let them opt in or out if you're going to go deep on a topic and you aren't sure they're also passionate about it. Watch this next clip for a super easy example of this with Mila Kunis. Not to say that I'm not looking forward to the new Star Wars movie. The new trailer is sick. I was so excited to see that new start. I loved it. Did you see the new trailer? Yeah, I thought it was amazing. It was with the new, the lightsaber that comes out that's like a little baby cross. I was like, oh my god, this is awesome. It's that simple. Bring it up with enthusiasm, make it relatable, and then allow the other person to opt in or out as you go deeper into the subject. Now, you can absolutely have only nerdy hobbies and be attractive, but there is something else that helps tremendously. Being attractive is easier when you have hobbies that give you at least two very different thin slices. Henry Cavill knows this about himself. But you were playing World of Warcraft and the phone rings and you're like, I'll get that later. I'll get, yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'll get that later. And I was playing, it was an important part of a particular dungeon that I was going through and it's cool now that I'm Superman. Yeah. And Joe Manganiello is the same way. He loves D&D, but he also loves football and ice climbing. You may think that what's happening here is that the nerdy stuff drags these guys down, but it just gets outweighed by the quote unquote cool things about them. But that isn't the case. To prove it, just look at guys like Joe Rogan or Lex Friedman. Joe wouldn't be nearly as interesting if he was just a buff dude into bodybuilding and jujitsu. He's way more popular specifically because he has a diverse and unusual combination of interests that includes athletics, psychedelics, wildlife, philosophy, and science. If Lex Friedman were just a jujitsu black belt, his podcast wouldn't be as successful. His varied interests in jujitsu, guitar, psychedelics, and artificial intelligence make it so that he's more appealing to a wider variety of people. For you, you're more attractive if people can't predict everything about you based on a stereotype. So this isn't to say you have to pick hobbies just for other people. But if you do have a diverse set of interests, get that across in conversation. It makes you harder to immediately stereotype or put into a bucket. And that ability to surprise someone by breaking out of where they initially bucketed you will instantly make you more intriguing. Now let's talk about a mistake that unfortunately a lot of people make — giving up on your physical appearance. This will be a quick point. Yes, guys like Joe Manganiello and Henry Cavill are genetically gifted in a way very few people are. But their looks aren't as God-given as you might think. Listen to Henry Cavill talk about his childhood here. There's nothing wrong with being overweight. It's just a common complaint from overweight people that they aren't seen as attractive. And attraction can't be negotiated or demanded. So if you wish that more people found you attractive, it's worth considering if you can improve your nutrition or fitness. This doesn't mean to become a bodybuilder. Find an activity you actually like, whether it's surfing, hiking, soccer, or yoga, and do what you enjoy. Now, that said, physique change takes effort and time. By far the easiest way to instantly look more attractive is simply a good haircut. My favorite example of this is Steve Carell. Look at him in The Office, Anchorman, and On the Red Carpet. He's the same guy wearing a suit in all three, but his hair creates a very different first impression in each. Adam Driver is another great example. Today he's a sex symbol, but you wouldn't guess it by looking at his Marine photo. So if you want to be more attractive, aim for a haircut that flatters your features. Okay, now let's get into the last mistake a lot of people make when trying to date or even just make friends. The mistake is hiding your interest because you fear rejection. So many people complain about being in the friend zone when they were the ones that initially put themselves there by being scared to express romantic interest. So they just hover around hoping the other person will express interest in them, or they go to a bar and see someone attractive, but they can't work up the confidence to go and talk to the person. This happens even when trying to make friends. People are so scared of making a negative impression, they focus on not doing anything that could be disliked, and you end up going unseen, making no impression at all. Instead, embrace being polarizing. Being willing to risk a negative impression frees you to make a strong positive impression. So in your own life, when that fearful inner voice pops up to try to stop you from taking a social risk, make it a point to focus on the possible upside and ask yourself, what would happen if this went really, really well? With practice, you can train your mind to habitually focus on positive outcomes, which will spur you to take action. That said, it's easier said than done to put yourself out there in a big way, to ask out your crush, ask for a promotion, or approach the person you admire. But every time you let your fear stop you, you've missed out on a potentially life-changing connection. If taking your confidence to the next level and erasing your fear of rejection is something that's important to you, you may like our video program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guide that's the fastest way I know to become confident and charismatic. You can read all the details in the link below, but I think the strongest way to let you know what it's all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. We've had thousands of people go through the program so far with an average rating of 9 out of 10 stars. Here are a few of the things that CU members have written in so far. This first one is from a guy who joined after a breakup. He says, Thank you so much for Charisma University. I thought that after completing this course, I'd become a smooth talker and be able to take over a room. What I didn't realize is I get that and feel so confident in myself. I feel liberated. This next one is from a woman who works as a clinical psychologist. She says, I absolutely love the content. I'm a clinical psychologist looking for material that can help my clients who have social anxiety. Charles' material is exactly what I was looking for. So excited to be a member of Charisma University. And this last one comes from a guy who transformed his confidence. He says, I wasn't truly confident. I was constantly seeking validation and cared too much about other people's opinions. But now my life has improved tremendously because of CU. I find it way easier to connect with people, to have great interactions, and to be happy, even if things don't go the way I want them to. Taking this course has been one of the most impactful decisions of my life. I can't recommend it enough. There's no time delay. If you join now, you'll be inside the course in minutes. And within just five days, you'll know how to make an amazing first impression on anyone you meet. The program takes just 20 to 30 minutes a day. And best of all, it's actually fun to go through because within two days, you'll be seeing people respond more positively to you in conversation. Also, even though results are quick, we give you a full 60 days where you can get a refund. So you have plenty of time to go through the entire program, twice if you really want to, and see if it changes your life. If it does, awesome. If not, you can get 100% of your investment back. That's how confident we are that you'll be happy you joined. If you want to check out the course, click the link on screen now or in the description underneath the video.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Iron Man has some of the most savage moments in the entire MCU but there is actually a consistent pattern to these moments that makes them so satisfying to watch and so useful if you apply the lessons in your life. So in this video, we are going to be breaking down Iron Man's most savage moments so that you can learn to command more respect in any situation. First off, Iron Man is an expert at using humor to direct the emotions of the people around him but he's not just a purposeless clown. He controls the frame of his jokes and that frame almost always suits his goals. Let's take a look at this example. All those breakthroughs — military funding, honey. You ever lose an ounce of that your whole life? I'm prepared to lose a few with you. In this case, Tony purposely interprets what is being said as if the reporter wasn't disgusted by him. You can see it again here when Congress is grilling Tony, telling him that he needs to give up his suit. He purposely misinterprets what they are saying, responding as if they want him to be their boss. ...to fold Mr. Stark into the existing chain of command, Senator. I'm not a joiner but I'll consider Secretary of Defense if you ask nice. We can amend the hours a little bit. The frame of these jokes is that everyone secretly likes and admires him and the power of the frame behind any joke is that it subtly influences people's feelings about you more so if you can get them to laugh. Now, when Tony is under physical attack, he switches the frame because this frame that everyone likes him is clearly not going to work. In this case, he needs to intimidate his foe and undermine their confidence so the frame is that the person that he is speaking to is really not that strong or threatening. We see it with Thor... Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's going around. Come on. Use your words, buddy. I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark. ...and perhaps the best example of this frame comes in Infinity War when Thanos throws a moon at Tony. He quips back with this... You throw another moon at me and I'm gonna lose it. If you find that you are sometimes the butt of the joke in real life, this is something to consider. What is the frame of the jokes that you are saying about yourself? This is one of the reasons you need to tread carefully with self-deprecating humor because if you are doing it from a place of low self-esteem, you're encouraging others to do it as well but the idea of frames extends far beyond just your jokes. If you're in any kind of physical contest, any kind of sport, this you-can't-hurt-me frame is excellent and you show it in everything from your words to your body language. So whether it's something like an MMA fight or basketball, make sure you don't show how tired you are even if you are tired because then your opponent knows to push your cardio harder. Some fighters in MMA, for example, go even further than this praising their opponents after they land a good shot. It is incredibly discouraging to any opponent to feel like they threw their best shot and you were left unphased. They have no choice but to respect your endurance. And that takes us to the second category of savage moments that we see from Iron Man. He is incredibly decisive which makes everyone around him respect what he has to say. You can see some of that in how firmly he cuts others off when he has something that he feels that he needs to voice. ...that your meaningless lives are now contributing to the balance... I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get out of here. ...is the point that he's making. I don't think there's any reason I can... The point is, you're welcome, I guess, because I'm your nuclear deterrent. It's working. We're safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can't have it. While we may not register it consciously, cutting someone off is a subtle display of power and if it's allowed to happen, the person who got cut off is deferring to the person who interrupted them. Now, this doesn't mean that you should go around shouting over other people but it does mean that you will generate more respect if you don't constantly let people do that to you. So how can you do that? Simply make sure to finish your sentence without trailing off lightly in the face of an interruption. That way, you can still have a free-flowing conversation people can interrupt but you're not instantly yielding the floor every time someone talks over you. In this next scene, Tony demonstrates this perfectly. I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up and that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturer division... ...until such a time as I can decide what the future of this company will be, what direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with. Tony's decisiveness comes through in more than his words. In times of confusion and crisis, rather than deliberate with everyone else, he's quick to make a decision for everyone around him. Sometimes, that means facilitating someone else's plan. You better think about this. Look at that. Look at me. Last chance yes or no? No. Okay. It's kind of a Springsteen-y working class hero vibe that I dig. Uh, happy we'll take you home. Yeah? Yeah. Sometimes, that means delegating leadership. Guys? Call it, Captain. All right, listen up. And sometimes, it means angering a lot of people by doing what you believe is right. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day but that up there, that's the endgame. How are you guys planning on beating that? Whether or not we like the decisions that someone makes, we can't help but respect decisiveness itself. But like most people, you may find that this rapid decision-making is rather difficult. Instead, you might get caught up in your head weighing endless pros and cons lists. So there's two things that will help speed your decision-making up tremendously. First, ask yourself, will this decision matter in a week? If the answer is no, the only way to go wrong is by delaying so shoot from the hip, refine your instincts with experience. If the answer is yes, ask yourself this next question that Jeff Bezos calls the regret minimization framework — what decision will I wish that I will have made in 10 years or what would I regret not doing? Expanding the time horizon often removes the smaller fears in our day-to-day life and inspires us to live to our highest ideals. As for the details, Tony has the right attitude. I don't have any other choice. Okay, we'll sort that out. This brings us to the final point which makes so many of Tony's moments more savage than they would be otherwise — Robert Downey Jr.'s powerful and domineering body language. Now, there are three big takeaways that we see both from Robert Downey Jr. and Tony Stark as he plays him. First, the extreme openness. I've covered on previous videos how open body language is powerful. It shows that you're comfortable in your own space whereas closed body language can signal a lack of confidence. Tony regularly takes open body language to an extreme level though. In addition to a bit of grandstanding, this open body language communicates complete comfort with the situation inviting any sort of threat without the need to close off. Similarly, Tony subtly dismisses threats with his lack of eye contact. Now, contrary to popular belief, powerful eye contact doesn't mean always staring someone down. Tony is able to make aggressors feel weak by not looking them in the eye. He is subtly signaling that he doesn't find them threatening enough to pay attention to. It's me. I'm here. Deal with it. Let's move on. A prison cell. I'll send you a bar of soap. Big man in a suit of armor. It's usually what? Performance issues. I have to say it is critically important in these situations that Robert Downey Jr. slash Tony looks to the side away from the person but never down when breaking eye contact. Looking to the side communicates that you are interested in other things. Whatever is approaching isn't that important. Looking down, on the other hand, communicates that you are very absorbed in what's approaching you but you don't have the courage to face it head-on. We also see Tony put his hands on everyone and everything. Now, be careful here. When done without a smile, this can come across as aggressive but when you communicate warmth, touching is a confident way to signal that you are on the same team as someone else. Now, if you want to learn more about the nuances of touching so that you're doing in a way that is not perceived as aggressive or overbearing, check out the video that we did on Thor aka Chris Hemsworth.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Shia LaBeouf has had some incredible swings of popularity in his life from child actor to blockbuster megastar to outcast and now to indie hit maker all while providing some great memes. So just do it! Make your dreams come true! In this video, we're going to learn how Shia has gone from those low points to regaining popularity all without being fake and we're going to cover both the specific behaviors and the mindsets that make it simple for you to be more popular without compromising who you are. The first thing that's going to help you with your popularity and your charisma in any situation is conviction. Conviction is the strong belief in what you say and do and other people pick it up in your subcommunication — that's your eye contact, your vocal tonality, and your gestures — typically, when those things are firm and unwavering. Now, in this next clip, you can notice the firmness of Shia's gestures — how he doesn't rely on filler words like um or uh and how he leans in and nods to make his points — each one of those being a subcommunication that he believes firmly in what he's saying. Yeah, that's me, like, trying to find my confidence. When you start meeting the Michael Jordans, the people you look up to, insecurity washes like a wave. Additionally, it's sometimes the case that cutting through details and getting to your point quickly conveys conviction. Now, this is typically the case in a debate and you see it often in those juicy Destroy-style videos where someone mic drops with a one-liner but that doesn't mean that you want to speed through everything in your life. In fact, slowing down, savoring the details can be an excellent way to show conviction particularly when you're storytelling. Now, the whole thing is incredibly well-told and worth a watch in itself but Shia telling the story of his arrest on Jimmy Kimmel is a prime example. He has the conviction that what he is saying is worth listening to and it allows him to go on several tangents all of which are funny but don't directly contribute to the story. For instance, in the one case of a homeless man that he was talking to while in New York. I'm trying to calm this homeless man down in the middle of Times Square and he don't want nothing to do with me but I'm not giving up. So, I chased him for a while. I'm trying to calm down. Hey, it's me. We were just talking. Relax. So if you're concerned that you might not be conveying conviction, a simple thing to practice the next time you're telling a story is to add just one tangent even if it's just the story of what you did today. This gets you in the habit of slowing down and it gives you the opportunity to build in extra jokes. Now, one last noticeable element of conviction is your eye contact. I spoke about this in our video on Don Draper and it's not that you have to make eye contact all the time just when you are making your main points. What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons. You can check out the whole video if you want a nuanced breakdown and, of course, you can practice all of these things — storytelling, gestures, eye contact — but the thing about conviction is that it is sub-communicated meaning that it's mostly occurring from gestures you're not usually in direct control over. You feel it in someone without really knowing why and that means you can get 90% of the results with 10% of the effort if you don't focus on all of the gestures but instead on developing a high conviction mindset that makes those gestures effortless and a huge mindset that will give you more conviction is being more honest. You see, when you have something to hide, your sub-communications naturally convey self-doubt. Take a look at Conor McGregor when asked about his altercation with a man in a bar. Either for personal or for legal reasons, he does not want to answer the question and it makes a guy who is usually very eloquent, super high conviction come across as evasive and unsure. How did you break your hand? Sparring. We scheduled a spar. Like I said, I came back from Miami. I scheduled a charity boxing bout in my old club, Crumlin Boxing Club. Many people couldn't fly to Vegas, you know. Shia, on the other hand, reveals exactly what got him in trouble with the law and his casual nature has a way of making it seem like less of an issue. They put a Hannibal mask on me and a lead jacket and it was just really rough. You must have done something very, very bad. I spit on a cop. It's a no-no. It's a big no-no. I'm sorry. If you're watching, dude, I'm sorry, man. That was crazy, man. Now this more honest approach doesn't just extend to things that Shia has messed up and it shouldn't do that with you either. To have complete faith in everything you say to really maximize your conviction, you have to know that no part of the truth is unspeakable and while it might seem extreme, Shia says a whole lot of things that many of us might consider too embarrassing to let other people know. Well, I'll say, look, like for a person who's not extremely well-endowed who's kind of insecure about my own junk, there's something about— Is your headphones ever cool? I noticed you keep— Yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to be cool. Hello, hello. What's incredible here is that his willingness to be honest doesn't just convey conviction and, of course, courage. It makes you like him more and that's because Shia is vulnerable in a non-attention-seeking way meaning that he's opening up but he's not sub-communicating that he needs your approval. He'll say something revealing but then move on without waiting for you to approve or to comfort him. Now, the opposite would be someone who shares how hard things are so that they can solicit your sympathy and now, this seemed more to be the case earlier in Shia's career when his vulnerability might have been more that attention-seeking variety though, of course, it comes down to interpretation. He was emotionally pouring out the whole time. Yeah. Non-stop. Non-stop. On the contrary, Shia's more recent non-attention-seeking vulnerability communicates that he values telling the truth and just refuses to hide it which is incredibly attractive. Watch Shia do that here. And watch here how he maintains the same strong body language in a vulnerable moment. Desperate to prove myself? Plus, comfortably sharing a fact that might be embarrassing or not paint you in the most desirable light is an excellent way to spice up a story. As soon as he's done with the last dude who comes out, he'll pivot. Uh-huh. And he'll eat it. And so you got to be quick with it. You got to get the sh-t out of his mouth. Now, if you're being honest, you will develop an awareness of your flaws which is, of course, easier to do when you are honest and you're going to realize that the problems in the world aren't just coming from other people. They're coming from you. The same things that you struggle to master in yourself are creating a lot of those issues and tempting as it may be to talk smack on someone else, Shia has learned that he's more like the people who are unkind to him than different from them so he's able to remain relatively non-judgmental. Watch. It's really just you want to make a mark. So people who are online doing the comments really just want to make a mark. They want to have an effect. So I think we suffer from the same thing which is just a lack of attention and love. Right. Well said. These moments of non-judgmentalness mark Shia as a leader and paradoxically, if you're unwilling to completely condemn someone who's been unkind to you, it makes you someone that the entire audience is more drawn to. So take someone, for instance, that you maybe hate or that you at least look down on. When you can see that you have more in common with them than you first thought, your life will change because you'll see that in your own way, even when you are doing wrong, you are both doing your best and it's not always the easiest but when you resist demonizing other people that you don't like or joining in on a hate parade, you get branded as a leader. Now, the last mindset to be popular without being fake is most evident in Shia's actions. You might not have seen him for a while since he's been working on lower-profile indie projects. In fact, last year, he created a theater group in one of the roughest neighborhoods in Los Angeles. What are the goals for this? The goals for this is really to change theater, right? We tried to build a theater for people who don't f**k with theater. Yeah. And if you look at like people who go to see theater now, they're old and white. Right. We're trying to create connection between people who don't f**k with theater and people who go to theater now and that's what we're trying to build. This is particularly interesting because that's not where you would expect to find someone who could be making millions of dollars in Hollywood blockbusters or hanging at parties with other A-list celebrities and you expect those things of him because you know that most people move towards power. For instance, when you chose your career or if you're choosing one now, it's likely to be pretty heavily influenced by how much prestige it carries or how much money you stand to make compared to the amount of passion that you feel on that topic or if that's not the case with you, perhaps you feel the urge to join the most glamorous social circle, to spend time with more beautiful people and the most socially plugged in. All of those things are moves towards increased power but if you pursue those things in and of themselves, like Shia, you're going to find out that it always doesn't have the best outcome for you. I was doing studio films for a while and lost my sensibilities and my connection to the material. Studio films in general, when you have to make a movie for a big general audience, you have to be less specific and the less specific you are, the less meat you have to chew on, the less meat you have to chew on, the less interesting it is for the actor. I need the Transformers. I need that idea. No, I ran from it because it was not serving me. It was destroying me. That's when I was getting really drunk and fucked up. That was all during that time when I just felt like I was becoming soulless. I couldn't navigate myself anymore. I just felt like I was dissipating. That's not to say that you can't connect with people who are well-liked. That would just be more judgmentalness. What it does mean, though, is that you need to shift your criteria for connection from power and prestige to humanity and quality of connection. This is the critical mindset. So many of us want to associate with people who can get us ahead. We want to be with the coolest, hottest, richest, most popular crowd but real long-term popularity, not to mention happiness, comes from focusing on the human side of connections and you see that in some of Hollywood's longest lasting stars. When you focus on connection instead of power, you wind up getting what you need in unexpected ways like Shia did, for example, with Zach Gottsagen. Now, Zach is a co-star in Peanut Butter Falcon and he was born with Down syndrome. But you said this changed your life as well. How is that? Well, he softened me. He's magnetic, you know? We became like brothers quite quick. There's no lead time to his love. It's just instant. And the volunteering and altruism that went into creating Shia's theater group actually wound up helping him tremendously. So, yes, I'm building a theater group but I'm also building that group of people that I need in my life. It's a family. While it might not be glamorous, ask yourself, who have you not been connecting with? Perhaps because you're nervous or perhaps because they don't offer a power advantage — the service people, the neighbors, the stranger in the elevator. If you make it a point to speak just one extra sentence to those people, you're going to find that you quickly become popular in a way that brings more happiness to you without having to compromise who you are. And if you're thinking, well, what's the point of that? I can't necessarily get ahead. Shia makes a compelling case. I don't even think it's about quality of friends. I think it's about quantity. You literally didn't have the numbers. I didn't have the numbers that I needed. Listen, man, we're tribal creatures. Yeah. And if you look like domestic marriages, you know, it's three people, four people. That's not the way humans were built to live. Yeah. We were built to have like groups of 60, 70. Yeah, so that's how we've survived since the caveman days. That sense of community, of 50 people you love and feel close to, it's something that a lot of people today don't have. And if that's something that you would like help with, I think the fastest way to get good at meeting new people and connecting on a meaningful level is with our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step video guided program that is guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in 30 days. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below but I think that the strongest way to let you know what it's all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few of the things that our CU members have written in. The first is from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I, hands down, had the best interview out of everybody and they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. Another person wrote about their social life saying, it has been truly incredible. I've instantly had results that seem insane. So many more meaningful connections, my friendships have improved, and my interactions with total strangers are new, exciting, fulfilling thing. I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system. And this last one is from someone who says that the course has been life-changing and he says, your course has been life-changing. To the point where I wake up in the mornings feeling like I've been transferred to a new person's body — the person I kept dreaming about becoming before I found Charisma on Command. It is incredible. I found myself and I found what makes me happy. And you can see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do so, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all. And I make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value out of the course. Otherwise, you can just refund. So, if you want to check the course out, go ahead, click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course, get a ton out of it — introverts, extroverts, men and women from all over the globe and I would love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope that you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 780}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"David Dobrik is a popular guy not only with his massive audience but also with very different types of friends including his vlog squad buddies — Jason Nash, who is 20 years older than him, and the one and only John Stamos. You're John Stamos! Dude, that's John Stamos! So in this video, we're going to break down how you can get some of that insane popularity without being an inauthentic tryhard. Now, the most obvious piece of what makes David so appealing to so many people is surprisingly simple — he makes you laugh and he does it by laughing and having fun himself. Is that right in the bottom? I don't know if I can get out of this one. I'm stuck here. They're proud. I don't know why I said it like that. I broke the hammer. Are you serious? This episode's gonna suck. What's up, guys? Welcome to my house tour. And you can see that same principle of laughter making other people enjoy themselves to the extreme in David's vlogs where there is an uproarious laugh every 5 to 10 seconds. Not only does laughter encourage other people to join in and enjoy themselves but when you laugh at other people's jokes, you're essentially complimenting them. Without words, you're saying, Hey, I think you're really funny. And people feel just as drawn to those who give hearty laughs as those who offer genuine compliments. So if you, in the back of your mind, think that there's some benefit to having a sophisticated sense of humor that only laughs at the most cleverly structured jokes, let that go. One particular thing that you might want to stop doing is insulting lowbrow humor. It's fine if you're not a fan of certain movies or YouTube channels but don't comment on how dumb they may seem to you. Otherwise, you're just reinforcing that not laughing is cooler to other people and in your own mind. Instead, allow yourself to laugh at the dumbest lowbrow silly jokes. And the more you let yourself go here, the better. The big open-mouth belly laughs are some of the most endearing. ...service here. It's so quick. It comes right to your table. Oh, shit. Oh, my god! That was fast. You don't need to respond literally to every statement in a conversation. For instance, in the next clip, David is talking to his co-host about how he wishes he could be home in the evening to watch The Office with his kids and David gravitates towards a humorous interpretation of what he just said. Like, they're really into The Office right now so they sit and watch The Office. That's so funny. It's so funny how they're into The Office but they both still call you daddy. I love The Office. Me and my daddy watch it. Now, these ideas may sound easier said than done especially if a silly attitude doesn't come naturally to you. In that case, you might think that being yourself means being serious all the time but actually, you can loosen up your sense of humor while remaining your authentic self. The key is in priming or changing your environment so that it puts you in a more fun state prior to interacting with others. Part of the reason that some people are so serious is because they do this backwards, only priming themselves with serious topics. At home, they watch the news. At work, they discuss what needs to be done and to relax, they maybe read nonfiction. So it's natural that when they interact with the doorman, the cashier, or even their loved ones, they're very serious and literal. Of course, there's nothing wrong with being serious but you can become unbalanced if you never make space for some goofiness. This is why purposely taking just five to ten minutes to prime yourself with the type of influence that you would like to embody is so important. I've personally loved watching clips of Chris Pratt because that sense of humor just clicks with me. ...back with an episode of What's My Snack? Last chapter, you ain't seen nothing. What's my snack? It's a carrot cake muffin. Oh, it's so good. What's my crack? It's good. If you want to see more of how Chris maintains that playful sense of humor, you can check that out in our video breakdown of him by clicking the link here or if you want a never-ending supply of jokes and good priming, David's vlogs can be a perfect primer before going out to socialize. Now, the second thing that you'll notice watching David is that his speaking contains a lot of high-impact words. Specifically, it's almost always about what he loves. I'm still like in like the best—I have the best job in the world so I can't complain. I posted a Vine. This is actually a really cool story. I'll still talk to my old high school teachers. Really? Who talks to their high school teachers? Me. I love it. I'll go back and visit them. What do you talk to them about? It's weird. I was always so excited. I was like on cloud nine. I was literally— And then, in Palm Springs, like— That was the most exciting thing. Even when David seems to have mixed feelings, he doesn't come down neutrally. He talks about what he hates and then what he loves at the same time. And they're both great. Yeah. They're both great and they both suck. The choice of these high-emotion words might not seem like a big deal but think of the person that you know who is always fine and thinks that things are okay. It's tough to care during your interactions with them and they wind up coming across as having very bland personalities. Now, since you don't want to be a tryhard, the answer here is not to artificially inflate your language with superlatives that you don't really feel. It's to move conversation in the direction of things you feel strongly about, particularly those things that you strongly like. So, for instance, if someone's asking get-to-know-you questions about where or how you grew up and you're not really super passionate about those answers, transition instead to something that you do care about. And you can see David do that here, in this case, towards the negative. It seems like the kids always have something more to prove. Yes. Do you think that kind of fuels you? Is that in your DNA? Maybe subconsciously. I've never thought about that. I was never like— You know what I hate? When I first moved to LA and I would pull up to like people in Lamborghinis and Ferraris and I'd be like, what do you do? Because that's just my favorite question to ask someone. How do I get the Ferrari? Yeah, and they go, work hard. And it was just a f***ing bullshit. And here, he moves towards the positive. First YouTuber friend. That's tough. I'm gonna change it to first Viner friend. Jack Dietrich, the guy who works here. Jack, come here. This is Jack. He actually helped me with my—he works here now. Genuinely kicked off my career, which is insane. Thank you, Jack. Generally speaking, you'll want to go positive but any emotion is going to be better than none. Now, if you've been a fan of the channel, this point might seem a bit odd to you because in videos with characters like James Bond or Don Draper, we talk about how their confidence is conveyed in their lack of emotional displays in their non-reactivity like here. Yankee, hey, go home. Are they making fun of me? A little bit. To clarify, the low reactivity that Bond and Draper are displaying is in the face of provocation often from an adversary. Their stillness shows us that they aren't afraid things will go wrong and that no matter what, they will be okay which is the core of confidence. But in many social situations, knowing that you will be okay looks more like David's enthusiastic self-expression than it does like Bond's icy coolness. So even though it might seem different on the surface, speaking in enthusiastic superlatives displays that same deep inner confidence that you might see in a James Bond or Don Draper. Ultimately, that person believes everything will be okay and that they can afford to be their goofy selves. Now, a fantastic question that will guide you in the direction of these authentic confident moments is to ask, how would I behave in this situation if I wasn't afraid? And in many social scenarios, the answer is that you'd be more expressive much like David. Also, if you're enjoying this video and want to make sure that you don't miss any of our new ones, you should hit the subscribe button and the notification bell now. We're going to be experimenting with different upload schedule and without the notifications turned on, you might miss some of those upcoming videos that I'm planning on people like Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and potentially one on the differences between sociopaths and psychopaths. Now, the next thing that you notice about David is that he's very comfortable with self-deprecating humor, often cracking up at himself as he tells his own embarrassing stories. This is so stupid. It's not so bizarre. I open my mouth and I let the water pour into my mouth. We've gone deeper into self-deprecation in the past, for instance, in the video with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. But as far as being a tryhard goes, self-deprecation can be a tricky topic because sometimes, it's used to tease our own insecurities before other people can get to them. And in those scenarios, it can be alienating to the people around us. But self-deprecating jokes aren't necessarily a good or bad thing on their own. Far more important is your mental state surrounding them. And the same question as before applies here. How would I behave if I wasn't afraid? If you find that you're avoiding self-deprecating stories because you're afraid other people might judge you, then it can be worth opening up a bit and laughing at some of your goof-ups. But, of course, you want to approach it with the same goal of enjoying those stories as David does. Even when he's laughing about how much he disappoints his personal trainer, he's having a blast. He made me do push-ups on my knees and I was like, Dude, I'm not doing push-ups on my knees. I started doing the push-ups and I couldn't finish. On the other hand, if you're only telling self-deprecating stories because you're afraid someone else will point out one of your insecurities first, then you're better served to relax and not feel so rushed to preempt other people. Either way, the goal is simply to do what makes you have the most fun, not what you think will make others respond in the best way. Now, the fourth unmissable thing about David is that he puts the spotlight on other people. His friends have become the stars of his vlog while he stayed behind the camera for the most part. He's given a dozen or more people a platform from which to launch their careers in entertainment and he's taken sponsor revenue to give away more than 15 ridiculously expensive cars. Now, during this rise to fame, that definitely meant that David was in the shadow of some of the people that he worked with, particularly, his ex, Liza Koshy. It's funny because there's been websites that have written articles about me and they'll be like, These are his best videos and all of them are Liza. I was at the airport today and a kid walks up to me and he's like, You look like Liza Koshy. That's what he said. But despite spending some time in the shadow of others, David continued to spread credit to his friends. My friends and the things around me. My friends are a big inspiration. I'm here in New York by myself and I'm crying to my friends that they're not here to film with me. And people have noticed. For having a YouTube channel that's a vlog about yourself, you're one of the least narcissistic. On camera, in real life, you're a total narcissist. Again, giving others the spotlight can be easier said than done especially when it means that you receive less attention and maybe you don't get to keep that car for yourself which takes us to the subtle mindset that underpins everything we've talked about in this video and it's learning to tap into the joy of others without having to become a people pleaser. You see, people pleasers can do all of the things that David does. They can make other people the spotlight, give away cars or gifts, and tell self-deprecating stories. But for the people pleaser, this stems from a desire to be liked and accepted by others. Ultimately, because they don't deeply like and accept themselves. And each one of those nice things that they do comes with a hidden expectation of how the other person needs to feel or behave in return. On the other hand, the person who's tapping into the joy of others might exhibit all those same behaviors — the gift-giving, joke-telling, laughing heartily at other people's jokes — but for them, it's not done to make other people like them more. It's done because witnessing the joy of others, participating in that, makes them happy in and of itself. They're able to experience this vicarious joy because they've already given themselves the love and acceptance that many seek from outside of themselves. Now, I can't say for sure what's going on inside of David's head but I can tell you that arriving at this point can take a while and the desire for validation rarely disappears completely. But you can move more and more in this direction over time. For instance, by taking on projects that are enjoyable even if they're never successful with a wider audience or simply by making a habit of looking into the mirror and saying, I love you to yourself when you wake up in the morning. By taking steps like these and giving yourself love and acceptance, you'll start to increase your inner confidence and then you'll naturally be able to make people like you, respect you, and want to be around you without trying too hard or being inauthentic. And if you want to fast-track yourself to that deep unshakable confidence, I highly recommend you check out our course, Charisma University. Charisma University is our step-by-step program that is guaranteed to make you more confident and charismatic in just 30 days.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, you'll learn 4 habits that will let you feel confident in almost any situation. We'll do this by analyzing some clips of Jake Gyllenhaal, someone who effortlessly projects a fun, confident attitude. This sweater is destroyed. It's done. Or it's the new rage. Puppy ripped sweater. The first step if you want to be confident in any situation is to learn to laugh at yourself. For an example, watch Jake in this next clip. He's being forced to read something he said about Hugh Jackman to Hugh Jackman. His strength comes from an engine of vulnerability. An engine of vulnerability. Gotta love that. Wow. Well, us actors are really pretentious, aren't we? When you laugh at yourself, you sub-communicate to the people around you that your imperfections don't bother you. More importantly, when you can laugh at your mistakes, you stop worrying about making them. Because confidence isn't thinking you're perfect. It's being comfortable with the ways you are imperfect. So how do you build this habit if you aren't currently comfortable with your imperfections? The easiest way to start is by telling funny stories from your distant past. For an example, listen to how Jake tells the story of bombing his Lord of the Rings audition. It's easier to laugh at stories from your past because there's a time separation. You could be a totally different person today. So you get to practice laughing at yourself without highlighting today's insecurities. Learning to laugh at yourself has another benefit. It trains you to feel confident even when someone is teasing you. But there's a difference between friendly teasing and someone trying to put you down. If you think someone is being rude, the confident thing to do is give yourself permission to call out behavior you don't like. Watch these next few clips to see how. First, Jimmy Fallon brings up a gossip magazine that was critical of Jake. Laughing wouldn't be bad here if you thought it was funny. But Jake doesn't find it funny so he's unapologetic and he holds his frame. Yeah, totally. In your own life, the key is to call out the behavior, not the person. Calling out the person would be something like, Hey, don't be a dick. That's likely to make them defensive. Calling out the behavior would be something like, Hey, I don't like when you do that. Please don't do it again. Now, in addition to calling out line crossing behavior, you also want to become comfortable calling out awkward moments. Most people don't think to do this because they believe calling attention to an awkward moment will only make it worse. The truth is, awkward moments get more awkward when you try to pretend they aren't happening. It's like that viral interview from a few years ago where the guest didn't acknowledge that his kids had walked in. Shifting sands in the region. Do you think relations with the North may change? I would be surprised if they do. Um, pardon me. So next time you find yourself in an awkward situation, acknowledge it with a joke and a laugh. Pretending it isn't happening only enhances the awkwardness. Here's one more example, this time with Jake and Ellen DeGeneres. We're just saying you are such an amazing actor and you choose such diverse roles and that you were a nightcrawler and you had lost all that weight because you wanted to be coyote-like. And in Southpaw, you're a boxer and your body is insanely good. Ellen acts like she's going to talk about his acting skills but quickly makes it all about his body. Jake feels weird about it, so he laughs and calls it out. And now you're doing, uh, what, what? No, it's funny. You're like, you're a good actor. You're so good. And your body is so good. Yeah. Like, I guess that's acting. Yeah. You can also do this when you're the one responsible for the awkwardness, like Jake is here. There's a great scene where you're at your wedding, your character's wedding, and you're breakdancing. Yes, I am. And you do a complete breakdance routine. Yes, I am. Jake's reaction is a little odd and you can tell Conan isn't sure how to respond. If you find yourself in an awkward situation like this, here's how to instantly turn things around. Yes, I am. How do you feel about your — you look at it now and you're feeling good about your breakdance routine? I expected a bigger response from that one. Yes, I do breakdance. By calling it out with a smile, Jake breaks the awkwardness. Now, you won't have a studio audience to applaud you, but the principle still applies in your life. For instance, let's say you just told a joke and it bombed and now there's an awkward silence. You can smile and say, I'm not going to lie. I thought that would get a bigger laugh. This will very likely get a laugh and diffuse the awkwardness caused by the bad joke because you've acknowledged it. The confidence to call yourself out comes from a mindset shift. Most people focus on trying to impress the person they're talking to. Instead, make your focus in conversation to have fun. What does this do? Press to operate. No! Don't touch it! I like how your names are on the chairs. It says Jake and Russell. You guys know which chair to sit in. No, we're idiots. Yeah, this is — I had to put this on here. It's like, how high are they? Yeah, by the way, the next interviewer comes on, I'm taking mine off and you keep yours on. It's just like, Ryan always needs his name on the chair. Jake will even extend some interviews and be late to others because he's having fun. One more, one more. This is so — this is fun. Just one more. Let's waste so much time. Just one more, ready? Now, a lot of people want to have more fun in conversation but they aren't sure how. Maybe you don't think you're funny or maybe you feel like your mind goes blank whenever you try to think of something clever to say. If that's you, then the easiest thing you can do is be a heightener. Keep an eye out for someone else to make a joke and then laugh, jump in and double down on it. This will help you be more playful in conversation and as an added bonus, whoever you're heightening will feel good that you liked their joke. Here's a fun quick example of how to do that with Jake and Ryan Reynolds. You're going to see like little red dots like come up a little bit. That's so true, that's so true. With a tranquilizer dart. So she's like... I got on the leg. And then just slowly — actually, the thing about it is to scare it. Now, everything we've talked about is much easier when you've internalized one mindset. Social confidence doesn't demand that anyone specific like you. It trusts that enough people will over time. This mindset lets you take the pressure off any single introduction, date or job interview because you realize you only need some of your conversations to go well, not all of them. So you can afford to make a few bad impressions in the pursuit of focusing on having fun. If you can adopt this abundance mindset, you will be way more confident in any conversation. Now, you might think building the habits in this video will take you a long time or maybe you think it's impossible for you that you could never actually put this stuff into practice. But building confidence is way easier than you think. With the right game plan, you can become significantly more confident in just a few weeks. If you want the fastest way I know to take your confidence and charisma to the next level, you should check out our program, Charisma University. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. I had confidence in some areas but not in others. Then Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes from knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. Another member wrote in, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. In conversations, I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think. I feel much happier all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman I've had a crush on for about a year and made a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep going back to it when I need a refresher on the daily action modules. And the last one writes, Thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values and I know who I am. The program is literally guaranteed to change your life. That means you can take the entire course and if you don't think it was worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund from inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Have you ever wished there was a blueprint you could follow to make people instantly like you? Good news — there kind of is. All you have to do is follow the three F's — be fascinating, funny, and make them feel good. I know that's easier said than done but in today's video, you'll get a set of tools that make it easy to do each. We'll do this by breaking down some of today's most charismatic celebrities, most prominently Will Smith and Chris Hemsworth, so you have real-life examples you can model. The first easy way to be both funny and fascinating is with storytelling. So how do you tell a good story? Any good storyteller starts with a hook. This is a small detail but it has a huge impact on if people will listen to you. One easy way to hook someone into a story is to set stakes. For example, listen to how Will Smith starts this story about bungee jumping from a helicopter. You can literally hear someone in the audience react to his hook at the end of the clip. He said, this bungee cord weighs 200 pounds and when we let it go, it's going to be the equivalent of four or five hundred pounds. And I'm going to count backwards from five. And on one, they're letting this bungee cord go. And the only way you can get hurt is if you don't get away from this chopper, right? Now, obviously, Will lived — he's there telling the story. But by adding stakes, you add tension to the story which hooks people in. A good hook sets you up for success but now you need to deliver a good story. The easiest way to tell fascinating stories is to make it immersive. Bring your listener on the same journey you went on when it happened. There's three tricks for this. Tell the story in present tense and, where appropriate, use sound effects and embody yourself and your characters. Listen to Will tell the rest of that bungee jumping story. So he's looking and it's... And I'm like... Right? Quick pause here. You can see how you can get people cracking up with just a sound effect and a change in your body language to embody yourself at the time. And then I can't really — I'm barely hearing them so I'm like... And then I see them go... And I'm like... Right? And he goes... Nothing happened in that story. That entire story could have been told as, I went bungee jumping out of a helicopter. It was fun. But by setting stakes and making it immersive, you will have people hooked and cracking up. This alone will make people love hearing your stories. But there's one more trick you can use to engage your listener even more. Make your story relatable. This is a fantastic way to make your stories interesting even if the topic of the story isn't interesting to everyone. For example, watch how Will Smith universalizes the experience of skydiving. When I walked up to the edge of that plane and you get attacked by your mind. Like, your mind is like, you stupid! You stupid! And it's screaming. You know that voice? We all have that voice in our head. It's not always our friend. It calls us names and stuff. And everyone's like, you're a dumb man. You're a very dumb man. You may have never been skydiving but you can relate to the story because you definitely have at least one area of life where that critical inner voice appears. When you give people something they can relate to in your stories, you'll get them nodding along and more engaged because they can see part of themselves in your story. This is especially useful if you're talking about a niche hobby or to someone who has different interests than you. Now, one issue people have — whether storytelling or just speaking in groups in general — is they don't know how to captivate and hold attention so that you don't get talked over or zoned out on. The easiest way to captivate and hold attention no matter what you're talking about is with your hands. That said, people often hear that and don't know exactly how to move their hands when they speak. They try it without any guidelines and then they feel weird or unnatural. One easy way to think about having naturally captivating hand gestures is the charades method. When you speak, use hand motions that sync with the meaning of your words. Watch how Will uses his hands when talking about the genie he played in the Aladdin remake. And that's part of what I could relate to. It's like Will Smith became so popular as a movie star and there were only certain behaviors that were acceptable from Will Smith. Right. So I sort of set myself free. Now, admittedly, Will Smith is a loud guy which naturally helps him captivate attention but not everyone feels comfortable speaking that loudly and you don't need to. In this next clip, Chris Hemsworth follows the charades rule when telling a story about finding a wild snake in his son's bedroom. He's more soft-spoken than Will but notice that he still captivates with his story. I just launched into like action mode, grabbed it by the tail, picked it up and everyone starts freaking out and it starts to kind of coil itself back up toward me which is getting ready to strike and I remember thinking, what the hell am I doing? So I just kind of threw the snake back into the bedroom and shut the door. This charades method will help you keep people engaged no matter what you're speaking about. It takes place across the universe. We're all sort of in certain groups and so on but a couple of times we had massive battle sequences and everywhere you looked was it was like being at the Academy Awards Halloween party or something, you know, dressed up in ridiculous outfits. I was at the airport a few weeks ago and this little kid was running around in the full Thor outfit. He has his hammer and he's smashing things and if you lost, you had to take your shirt off and you got a free shot at the ball in the back. This works really well in tandem with the immersive storytelling tricks like sound effects and acting out your characters. For an example, watch the story of Chris sneaking his daughter onto the Tower of Terror ride at Disney. Notice his hands and also how he gets a laugh with a sound effect. You know, the seat is massive on her and I'm like, you know, we beat the system, honey. And then it drops and she's like, grab on her, she's like screaming the whole way down like, I was like, maybe there's a reason that there's a height. Maybe? Now that you have a few tricks to be more fascinating, let's get into the second F with two easy ways you can be funnier. If you want an easy trick to make a story funny, use the fakeout method. Will loves to use his tone of voice to make people expect something good and then reveal something bad that's unexpected. This is something we covered in our recent Ryan Reynolds video so we'll do a quick version here just because it's a fun clip. If you want to learn more about it, we'll link to the Ryan Reynolds video in the description down below. Okay, here are two quick examples where Will is talking about how much fun he had taking his whole family skydiving. And you just go into this really blissful place. I'm telling Jada, you know, you're gonna meet heaven when you go up there and she didn't. My sons, we went to Dubai and we went skydiving, right? So my father-in-law, he was last out of the plane and he comes down and everybody comes in and you cheer when everybody comes down and then my father-in-law comes in and he's totally unconscious. You can combine a fakeout with what you learned about immersive storytelling which you can see Will does later in the story to get another laugh. Jada looks at me like... and goes and walks over and we go to the emergency room. You know, Jaden is looking at me. He was like, Dad, you can't push people out of their comfort zone. He's a grown-ass man. If this feels complicated or overwhelming, there's an even easier way you can make people laugh — contagious laughter. This isn't about forcing yourself to laugh. It's about focusing on telling stories that you find genuinely funny. Here's a great example with Julia Roberts sharing how much she loves jumpscaring her kids. But the other week, there was just such a golden opportunity. I was coming downstairs and my oldest son was coming down the hall. It's so wrong. She hasn't even gotten to the story yet but just her laughter makes you want to smile and laugh. When he came around, I just jumped down and said, Boo! He sprung out his legs and his arms and went out. Honestly, scared the Jesus out of him. Without her laughing, that story is literally just, My kid came around a corner the other day and I yelled, Boo! But because of how she tells the story, she comes off as likable and fun to listen to. Here's another quick example with Robert Downey Jr. where he's pitching an invite to join him at an Avengers premiere. You might even ride your sugar high. After riding your sugar high all the way to a fitting, you walk — I'm sorry. Now, obviously, you don't have to do this. Deadpan humor can be great and if that's your style, stick with it. But laughing while you tell a funny story is easy and you don't run the risk of being misunderstood like you do with deadpan sarcasm. So how do you cultivate positivity and get used to laughing out loud if this isn't already your default habit? The easiest way is to prime yourself before you go into a social situation by watching something you know will make you laugh. Ideally, with someone that has the same type of humor you're trying to master. This has two benefits. One, it puts you in a laughing state so future laughs come easier. This laughing state is why big stand-up comics always have other comedians warm up the audience before they come on. And two, monkeys see monkeys do. By watching clips of the type of humor you're trying to master, you get your brain thinking in that mode before you go out. Okay, so we've covered fascinating and funny. Now, let's move on to the third F — making them feel good. A lot of what we've covered is already going to do that. If you're smiling and laughing and making them smile and laugh, they're going to feel good around you. Similar to contagious laughter, this is contagious positivity. The easiest way to take this a step further is with high-quality compliments. Here's a quick example with Will and his Aladdin co-star Naomi. It's starting to be more and more important to me that the ideas and the messaging of the piece be a contribution to the human family, you know? I just cannot wait till all of your daughters get to see the Princess Jasmine that Naomi created. A high-quality compliment is genuine, specific, and touches on something that the other person takes pride in and, ideally, doesn't hear often. Here's another great example with Hugh Jackman and Emily Blunt. You can tell that initially, this compliment doesn't mean much to Emily. Listen, don't undersell what you did. Julie Andrews is unbelievable in every single way. You are unbelievable in every single way. No, I mean it because... Now watch her reaction as he adds specificity to the compliment. It's also, you go in as someone who knows musical theater and movie musicals. You go in like, that's a lot. You've taken on a lot. That's a big part. And from the opening scene, you just go, ah. Oh, you're the best. There's a lot that goes into giving a compliment that's actually well-received. Something that feels genuine and doesn't make you seem like a suck-up. If you want to learn more about the nuances of compliments, we'll link to our video, How to Be Nice Without Being a Pushover in the description down below.

      "[RIZZBOT] Starting transcription for rizzbot/Audio/How To Charm A High Status Person： 5 Tricks From Sean Evans.mp3\n",
      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"It's frustratingly common to get completely tongue-tied when we're in front of people we'd like to impress which is doubly unfortunate because it's often those situations that could lead to us landing a great new job, connecting with a mentor, or even dating someone that we're smitten with. And that's why in this video, I want to cover how you can avoid that awkward trap and impress the people you admire by standing out in an incredibly positive way. To do that, we're going to be referencing one of the people who has done this many times — Sean Evans of Hot Ones. So let's start by looking at Sean's greatest skill — asking killer questions. If you could steal one item out of Casey Neistat's studio, what would you grab? Oh, wow. That's a good question. He's got a lot of stuff in there. He's got drones. Can you give me a band that people make fun of on the internet that you think deserves a lot more respect from a songwriting perspective? That's a great question. Do you ever think about how much your narrative is shaped by the need to package the details of your life into these instantly accessible anecdotes? That's a great question. Sean Evans is the best f***ing host on the internet. Nailing your questions is especially important when interacting with people of higher status because chances are they've been asked the same question over and over and over again. Take Saoirse Ronan, for instance, who must be tired of this kind of question by now. What's the worst pronunciation of your name you've ever heard? What's the worst butchering of it you've ever heard? What's like the weirdest one you've ever heard? And it's not just celebrities who get repetitive questions. If you've ever come home from college or a vacation to a slew of, well, how was it questions, you know the feelings. So if you want to impress someone, don't go for the low-hanging fruit. A much better strategy is to empathize with the person, to ask yourself what question they probably get all the time and then to ask a question beyond the obvious one. Here, Sean does it avoiding obvious direct questions about the Star Wars plot and instead asking John Boyega about the security measures that were present to prevent spoiler leaks. Can you reveal some of the behind-the-scenes security measures that go into putting a cap on Star Wars? I know. I remember I put an overcoat because every time we leave the set, we can't actually leave in costume. Now, asking questions beyond the obvious, of course, becomes easier when you know a bit about the individual and this is a reason why Sean's crazy prepared research tends to be so well appreciated. Can you tell the people about the instruments of destruction? Oh my god! What?! Sean, where'd you even find that info? Dang, deep cuts. You're like a really well-researched and like great interview. This is wild. So are you. Thanks. So are you. So even though you're probably not conducting interviews, you can apply the same principle in your own life prior to attending a networking events or an interview, for instance. Read up on the person or the company. Get to the point where you don't need to ask how they got their start or what industries they work with or anything that you could find on their about page for that matter. That way, you avoid questions that immediately disqualify you. But avoiding those questions isn't enough. After all, we don't necessarily notice the things that don't happen in interactions as much as we notice the things that do happen and that's why you want to make sure to take another trick from Sean's playbook which is the question preamble. Watch here. In that 20 years, the TV food scene has exploded, you know, from the stand-in stir shows to the cooking competition boom to the current obsession with culinary travel and when you look at that timeline because you've spent about 20 years in this game now, what do you see as some of the watershed moments, the highlights and the lowlights when you look at that time? You just saw Sean MC someone — almost showing off a bit of his knowledge about them which isn't strictly necessary. After all, of course, the guest is going to know about their own past but this makes a clear distinction between Sean and interviewers who haven't done their research and it makes the guests reciprocate his effort in that response. Do you still dream of having a chicken TV show where you have celebrities do voices for the chickens and, if so, who are the actors at the top of your list? Yeah. How do you know about the chicken cartoon? Do you remember about celebrating with Lil Wayne? Um, that night? Yeah, I really do. I really do. That information, huh? I really do. Yeah, don't worry. In your own life, opening with a short preamble is an excellent way to begin a conversation with a recognizable name that you may encounter at a meet-and-greet or if you're sending a cold outreach email. Just one or two sentences that highlight a specific perhaps more obscure element of their work immediately separates you from the pack and I say this from personal experience. When I receive emails with just those one or two sentences that indicate someone has invested in my content, I am much more likely to respond compared to someone who appears to have sent out a mass depersonalized email. So show off what you know a bit. One caveat — do not fall into the trap of fawning the entire interaction. Just one or two sentences at the beginning is plenty. You want to connect with the individual on a personal level which brings us to our next point — steer conversations towards things that elicit emotion. For instance, someone's passion — just watch John Boyega's eyes when he's asked about something that he loves. So, First We Feast recently did a deep dive into the connection between anime and hip-hop on this new show that we have called Goji Gang and I know that you're a huge fan. This is important because often when we meet someone that we admire, we go with the logistical things that we'd like to know the answer to — how did you start? What would you recommend to someone at my age? What can I do to get a job working with you? And in addition to being the most common questions that people in a public role may receive, those are also questions that don't engage anyone on an emotional level. Now, you may not know John Boyega loves anime and hip-hop but you can still steer questions towards an emotional response by using the best and worst structure which is one of Shawn's favorites — just watch. What was the best thing about living in Iowa and then what was the worst thing about living in Iowa? Oh, wow. Good question. What do you see as some of the watershed moments, the highlights and the lowlights when you look at that time? In asking these highlight and lowlight questions — the best and the worst — Shawn gets people to talk about the things that we all find irresistible. First off, it's the things that we love. Those are the things that we can go on forever about. Here, Shawn is asking Adam Carolla about his love of crows and he waxes philosophical. Crows. I love crows. Can you tell me why you love those squawking birds? So much. Describe it to me in as much detail as possible. Okay. Now, when people are sharing their lowlights, they often won't share the things that make them sad. In fact, those are things that tend to get people to clamp up but when you ask them more directly about things that frustrate them, well, people will talk your ear off and it's partially because we're often told not to complain so when someone gives us the green light, it can feel so good to finally vent about something we find annoying. Where are pitch meetings more likely to be parodies of themselves — in Hollywood or in Silicon Valley? Oh, that's a great question. I think Silicon Valley. You'll literally get in an elevator and someone's like, I just got to tell you about my company. I just got to tell you about my company. Let me just tell you about my company. I have to tell you about my company. In either case of things that people love and things that they find frustrating, the guest's enthusiasm for the conversation spikes and this is something that gets associated with the question asker if you're using this technique — you. So for instance, say that you get to the end of an interview for your dream job and you're asked, so, do you have any questions for me? Much better than asking, well, how do you like working here is to adjust the question and ask instead. So tell me, what would you say are the best moments or highlights of your job and what would you say the lowlights are or maybe the most frustrating things? The emotional charge immediately generates more interest. But of course, impressing people that you admire goes beyond just asking questions which is why you see Sean demonstrating that he isn't just a replaceable star-struck question-asking machine. For instance, he'll playfully tease guests like here when he jokes about Rhett and Link's cheesy intros. Here's one for those of you that are unfamiliar. Who dominoes if Pizza Hut is better? Let's talk about that. And here Sean is teasing them about it. What we'll do is try to guess the flavor. Are you making fun of us? If I were making fun of you, maybe I'd say something like, which cream is the dream? Let's talk about it. I'm not going to say that. Similarly, when people poke fun at Sean, he's comfortable shooting back a zinger like here. Why am I asking a snowstorm of a man? How dare you? Is it Hindi or Urdu? Like talking to an H&R block. Okay, all whitey then. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! On the channel, I've advised against being sarcastic and I'm not telling you to do that here but this willingness to be playful highlights one of the most important things that people leave out of their encounters with those they admire — they don't have the willingness to take the risk and have some fun. We can become so afraid of messing up that we wind up being completely vanilla which, of course, backfires when we don't stand out at all. So recognize if you have a tendency to be especially literal when you're nervous and if it's the case, lean towards cracking more jokes when you're around people that you want to impress. A very simple way to do this is by not answering every question that is asked of you in a totally serious manner. Sean demonstrates how to do this here. That's not normal. In fact, this program is not normal. Have you ever killed anybody? We haven't heard from Coolio in a long time. Seriously. In the same vein, when we want to impress someone, we sometimes lose our ability to comfortably express disagreement even if it's about something as simple as whether or not a movie that we both saw is good or bad. Now this is one that we don't get much chance to see in the Hot Ones format but there is another famous host who does this very well and that is Joe Rogan. You can dive into the entire breakdown we did on him linked in the description but here's just one example of how to disagree with someone in a way that is assertive while still remaining polite and it's by highlighting where you still agree prior to disagreeing. You beat Gonzaga. It was a good fight. Yeah. You're a very good fighter. That's not what the issue is. The issue is can you become a champion? If you can't become a champion, are you comfortable with getting knocked out three or four more times? You can see more details on Joe Rogan in the video on him but the point for this video whenever it comes to people that you want to impress is to just make sure that you aren't stifling your own thoughts and opinions in an attempt to come off as agreeable and that really takes us to the mindset that makes all of this much easier to incorporate and act upon. When it comes to those people that you want to impress, you need to see past what they may represent to you to the human beneath. You see, it's very easy to see people as icons. You may focus on how they can help you to get promoted or the book that they wrote or how impressive their following must be and when you do that, it makes you feel completely separate, different, and maybe even beneath them. But when you see them as human, you recognize that they probably have a life a lot like yours outside of their public persona. They might like to goof off with their friends, brag about their kids, argue about sports, or nerd out about their favorite fantasy series. And when you look for those aspects, you get curious about exactly the things that they want to connect over but everyone else just breezes past. And you realize that you're not so different which helps diminish the gulf that you may unconsciously place between you. Asking about their personal interests or cracking a joke or even having a spirited disagreement come much more naturally when you see people not just as the role but as a human. If you feel like your social confidence can be inconsistent or just not there in the moments where you most need it like with superiors, our Charisma University program comes with a 30-day action guide that gives you a step-by-step path to unshakable confidence in that situation and many, many more. You can read all about the program with the link below but the strongest way, I believe, is to let you know what members have said about the course themselves. So here's just a few things that CU members have written in. The first is from someone who used CU in an interview and she says, I love the way that you lay out the charisma styles. It was awesome to see which one fit my personality. Of the five, I found the authenticity style really resonated with me. I was super honest and authentic during the interview for my current job. I was interviewing my boss as much as she was interviewing me. I got the job and my boss still mentions my interview and my honesty to this day. Another member wrote in, I was really bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. In conversation, I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think or how I feel even in bigger group settings. I feel way more happy all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman I've had a crush on for over a year and make a good first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep coming back to it when I need a refresher on the daily action modules. And lastly, one member writes, thank you so much for this program. After going through Curriculum University, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values and I know who I am now. Now, you can see more success stories like those in the comments if you decide to join the course and if you do, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee 100% for any reason at all and that's 60 days even though the course only takes 30 to complete just to make sure that every single member truly feels that they are getting a ton of value from the course. So if you want to check out the course, go ahead. Click the link on screen now or below in the description to do so. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it and I'd love for you to do the same especially given that the new year is right around the corner and this can be a fantastic resolution. Either way, I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 791}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': 'So I saw this video on YouTube that was the speech that made Barack Obama president and I don\\'t remember it so I want to dig in and find out what exactly it was that put Barack Obama onto the scene. I do remember it kind of came out of nowhere so I\\'m curious what it is and if I can give the speech, if I can be president in 16 minutes. Tonight is a particular honor for me because let\\'s face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. Pause. Excellent pause. I love it already. I just got done watching Elon Musk and this is a fantastic example of not feeling with um or uhs, just allowing that to happen. Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um. What he does do is he addresses different part of the audience with this pause so check it out. My presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. If you look, we talked about this, 2-3 second rule, 2-3 seconds and he just pans back. Now, is he actually able to focus in on an individual which is actually what I recommend if you are speaking to a crowd, if you\\'re in a boardroom or if you\\'re in a classroom, it\\'s helpful to find that one person in each section of the room that is actually engaged in looking at you and look them in the eye. I don\\'t think he\\'s able to so he\\'s probably just built this habit or maybe he is, maybe he can actually see individual people. And just as a point of comparison, not to pick on him, but if you look at Elon Musk, he often ignores this advice and tends to look at the floor during his presentations. We did want to point this out and show that this is actually does work. Um, it\\'s just not something that the average person could use effectively. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America. A lot of palm showing we see, a lot of gentle palm showing, friendly, inviting, you can see what\\'s going on with his hands. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Good, reacting to the audience, letting some of that in, that\\'s important because this isn\\'t like the speeches this year. This isn\\'t just to a camera, this is in front of people. So hearing them, reacting to them, that\\'s going to cause them to give you back more. Something that you\\'ll see in people who aren\\'t as comfortable with public speaking is that they tend to ignore the audience and they\\'ll focus instead on the speech in front of them or the lectern and the presentation basically more than the audience. Hey guys. Welcome to the Cybertruck unveil. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack or Blessed, believing that in a tolerant America, your name is no barrier to success. They imagined me going to the best schools. And so the audience obviously here is America and so he\\'s giving the audience a fantastic reputation, right? He\\'s saying in a tolerant America, your name is no barrier to success and here he is speaking at the DNC. So this kind of stuff that hypes the audience, right? You see rock stars do it. How we doing Philadelphia? I love this city, right? He, whether it\\'s on purpose or not, is definitely speaking to the audience in a way that makes them feel good about themselves. We gather to affirm the greatness of our nation. Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise. So this is good. This creates mystery even within a single sentence. We do this not because thing one, thing two, thing three, alright? So we\\'ve already created some tension, some mystery. You\\'re taking some time here. Why are we so great? And then he pauses. ...military or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise. What is it? Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. He drags it out a little bit. Okay, now we know. And right here, then we get that anticipation. Kind of like when you know that a good punchline is coming and you just want it to happen. Repetition. And so what he\\'s doing with this repetition and why this is important, and sometimes you\\'ll see me do it when I\\'m giving examples in my video, is he\\'s speaking to a broad, diverse audience. But he\\'s giving specifics, very specifics. You know, seven bucks an hour, who\\'s competing for a job. But he needs to feel like he\\'s hitting each of the bases, that somebody out there cannot find something in one of these repetitions to identify with themselves. But, and this is important, you can\\'t just say, You can\\'t just say, for everybody, because that doesn\\'t matter. This is the difficulty between the specific and the universal. You want to give a list of specifics because people will find at least one of those to connect with. But if you just say, we just have to do better for everybody, that doesn\\'t create an image in people\\'s heads. And what we need in order to feel moved are not abstract ideas simply, right? Those are important. But it\\'s also something to tie into, to latch onto. And that\\'s why these specific examples that are sometimes kind of drawn out exist in this speech. Now, don\\'t get me wrong. The people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks... It\\'s everybody. He\\'s not saying the people I meet everywhere. It\\'s the people I meet in small towns, big cities, diners. He\\'s going to hit everybody, but he can\\'t do it just by saying, the people I meet everywhere because that doesn\\'t connect. You know, a while back, a while back, I met a young man named Seamus in a VFW hall in East Moline, Illinois. So here we go, specific. And this is critical. I do this all the time, right? I\\'m speaking to you guys. I don\\'t often speak in stories. Stories are so good for connecting with people. You just have to remember to tie it back to the universal. So let\\'s see what he does. He was a good-looking kid, 6\\'2\", 6\\'3\", clear-eyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. And as I listened to him explain why he\\'d enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought, this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child. But then I asked myself, are we serving Seamus as well as he\\'s serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors who won\\'t be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I\\'d met who were struggling to get by without a loved one\\'s full income or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered but still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists. When we send our young men and women into harm\\'s way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they are going. So imagine this. If he had just said from the start, when we send our young men and women in, we can\\'t do this, it doesn\\'t connect. But because we have a guy, Seamus, who is 6\\'2\", good-looking kid, all these wonderful things, of course, we can\\'t let Seamus down like that and so when we can come back to those individual stories, that is what people remember, that is what makes people motivated and persuaded, and Obama did a fantastic job in this speech of bouncing back and forth. ...who can\\'t read, that matters to me even if it\\'s not my child. If there\\'s a senior citizen somewhere who can\\'t pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it\\'s not my grandparent. Yep, the choice of I right here is really good and I think this is when they talk about this making him president. This stuff is now sticking to him. He\\'s the one that cares about these people. So if you\\'re actually interested in taking this from something that you see Obama doing to something that you feel more comfortable doing, there\\'s obviously a lot of pieces. You have to have the confidence to do this but also there\\'s techniques, storytelling technique, gestures, and so the best thing that I know of for actually turning this from theory into something that you practice in your life is a course that I made called Charisma University. It\\'s a 30-day program. It\\'s all about taking tiny actions to start to make these sorts of things habits so that you feel a deep level of confidence but that you\\'re also nailing the specific techniques and we cover a whole lot of them with regards to storytelling. So if you want to check that course out, you can do so with the link below. Like I said, it\\'s the best thing that I know of to actually start installing charisma, making it a habit, and quite frankly, it might help you turn your next speech or next conversation into something that actually goes far better than you\\'ve ever seen before. Now, even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers, who embrace the politics... The enemy, the classic enemy. Who will the enemy be? Who\\'s the bad guy? Now, in almost every story, there\\'s going to be an enemy, right? If people are going to band together and they need to feel like there\\'s an outside force. This is kind of the plot and I don\\'t want to spoil it. Spoilers if you don\\'t want to hear it of Watchmen, right? that Ozymandias has to come up with this extraterrestrial threat to get everyone to join forces against an enemy that we can unite against. Now, the question is, if you\\'re running for president of the United States, who is your enemy? You do not want to make it the other party. This was a huge gaffe by Hillary with that whole box of deplorables. You know, she said that half of Trump voters were a box of deplorables. You can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Not a good look because people identify as Trump voters or at least did at that part of the election cycle. But who identifies as a spin master, right? Who\\'s going to identify? Oh, I\\'m the bad guy. I\\'m the spin master. And since I picked on him, this is actually something that Elon does pretty well. He definitely makes other car companies the enemies in some of his speeches and that actually turns the fanboys to become more diehard for Tesla. It\\'s actually hard to tell. It\\'s hard to tell which is which, really. Took the brands off. We took the brands off, but it\\'s hard to tell which is which with the brands off. They\\'ll pretty much look the same. We need something different. And we need sustainable energy now. In the end, that\\'s what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I\\'m not talking about blind optimism here. The almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don\\'t think about it or healthcare crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That\\'s not what I\\'m talking about. I\\'m talking about something more substantial. It\\'s the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta. The hope of a mill worker\\'s son who dares to defy the odds. The hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him too. Hope. So what he has really done and I think why people say that this is what made him president is that this speech has woven the American story and his story and it\\'s like his is the next chapter. This is what it was set up for. It\\'s kind of what this speech is not heavily implying but intimating in a certain way and it\\'s, you know, it\\'s a way of saying that this is the next chapter not heavily implying but intimating in a certain way and it\\'s, I mean, I\\'m buying it, you know. America, tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, I mean, yeah, I didn\\'t know that he did this but this is a direct homage to MLK\\'s I Have a Dream speech. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that, let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. From Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness, a brighter day will come. Thank you very much, everybody. Honestly, the weakest part of this whole speech is the fact that he had to work John Kerry and John Edwards into it, right? I mean, he told, really, this is his speech. This is the speech for him to be president and quite frankly, upon watching it, I think it probably is what catapulted him. I\\'d have to look at the historical timeline but it makes a lot of sense. He is a fantastic speaker. I did a video on him a long time ago. It\\'s lower production quality but even at the time, check it out. He\\'s very, very good at galvanizing a room and creating a sort of common unity, right? We are in this together and this is where we are headed and he addresses the concerns of the different factions inside there, makes everyone feel included and switches effortlessly between the singular and the whole, right? One is not sacrificed for the other. He\\'s just really, really, really good at what he does. And like I said before, if you see Obama or you see any of the people that we\\'ve covered on this channel and you feel like you would like to be more consistent in your own charisma so that you\\'re coming across that confident, you might want to check out our course, Charisma University. Like I said, 30-day program, best thing that I\\'ve ever created with regards to learning charisma personally and you can check that out, everything that it includes by clicking the link in the description below. So I hope that you\\'ve enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.', 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 893}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, you'll learn how to be extremely likable whether you're an energetic extrovert or a soft-spoken introvert. We'll cover how to make an amazing first impression and how to turn that first impression into deep relationships with people that love and admire you. People often ask us, what do I say in conversation? But just as important is how you say it. To see what I mean, watch this quick 10-second clip of Brad Pitt. Try to take note of what you see that's charismatic. Brad is certainly helped by the fact that he's extremely good-looking. But beyond that, there's four charismatic habits jammed into those 10 seconds. These habits will make you more charming no matter what you look like. They are listening with warm, soft eye contact, a Duchenne smile, meaning a smile that reaches your eyes, making the outer edges wrinkle, speaking through a smile, and using expansive gestures. Expansive meaning your elbows don't stay glued to your sides. If all you take from this video is those four habits, you'll already be above average in charisma. This doesn't mean you have to plaster a smile on 24-7 to be charismatic. For example, when you're telling a story, you want to embody the emotions of each character. But when you get back to talking about something happy or funny, bring back that Duchenne smile. For an example of what this looks like, watch Brad in this next clip. He's talking about trying to sneak a spoken line into his first movie role as an extra. Now let's talk about something that a lot of people struggle with. How do you captivate people so that they really want to hear what you have to say? One way is with a pre-story laugh. This signals that what you're about to say is funny. This has to be genuine, otherwise you risk coming off very weird. So the easiest way to do this is to tell stories you genuinely find funny. Then you don't have to force a laugh, you just have to allow the laugh that naturally comes up when you think of your story. If that's not something you think you can do well, there's another way you can get people interested in what you have to say. Use a one-line hook. An intro sentence that hints that you're about to share something very interesting. Tweaking that slightly to make it more universally applicable, one hook you can use often is this is one of my favorite stories. If you don't like that one, there's a second hook you can use, this time from Leonardo DiCaprio. That phrase, I'll never forget, is a powerful way to introduce a story. It implies that what you're about to share had a big emotional impact on you. Now, everything so far will help you make a great first impression. These next two habits will help you take that first impression from, oh, I like this person to, oh, I really like this person. The first habit that does this is making someone feel good around you. Maya Angelou said it best. People will forget what you said, but people will never forget how you made them feel. People love to feel seen and appreciated, especially once they've decided they like you. One of the easiest ways to do this is simply by laughing when someone makes a joke. Brad does this even when he's not supposed to, like when his co-star is ad-libbing in a scene. Your goal here is not to fake laugh. It's to laugh freely when you do find something funny, instead of holding in your laugh like most people do, limiting it to a quick chuckle or even just an exhale. If you struggle to laugh when you're in conversation, that's okay. Laughing is a habit that gets easier the more you do it. So a good practice is to watch something you know will make you laugh right before you go out. This will prime you to be in a better mood to laugh. You can take this connection builder to the next level by adding in a light platonic touch and a compliment. On the topic of compliments, there's a big mistake a lot of people make here. It's selective kindness, only being kind to certain people, like your boss or the person you're attracted to in a group. This comes off as manipulative. You want to be universally kind, especially to people that most people ignore, like receptionists, servers, or in Brad's case, translators. The best, right? I keep forgetting to give short answers, and I give these long, winding, babbling answers. Wow. I think we need to have a little hand for our translators. That was impressive. Most people in conversation try to elevate themselves. This self-focus can be off-putting and it can create a feeling of neediness or desperation. It's counterintuitive, but when you're willing to elevate other people, it shows self-confidence and it makes people want to be around you. We've covered compliments in detail in other videos, but just to quickly review, the best compliments will be something you genuinely appreciate about the other person, something they take pride in, and ideally, something they don't hear often. This is especially powerful if they respect you in the area you're complimenting. Now, while compliments are a fantastic way to make people feel good, if all you do is compliment, it will get boring and predictable, so you want to mix in humor as well, specifically playful teasing. Gotcha. One tip for teasing, try to calibrate to the other person. If they seem sensitive after you tease them once, go light on them. If they laugh loudly and tease you back or play along, you're good to lean into it. A second tip with teasing, tease yourself too. This lets people know that it's all in fun and you aren't actually mocking them. For example, in that same speech where Brad teases Quentin Tarantino for his foot fetish, he teases himself for being single. I gotta add this to my Tinder profile. The last habit we'll cover today has the potential to create lifelong bonds. When someone you care about is dealing with something difficult, be a shield in their shield wall. Sometimes people go through things that are hard to handle alone. If you can be there to support them through it, they'll remember you forever. For example, Brad dated Gwyneth Paltrow in the 90s. During that time, Harvey Weinstein made a pass at Gwyneth while he was her boss. Were you afraid that the movies would be cancelled? I was afraid. When this happened, Harvey was one of the most powerful people in Hollywood. His influence was bigger than any actor, even Brad Pitt. But listen to what Brad did the next time he was in the same room as Harvey. And Harvey was there and Brad Pitt, it was like the equivalent of throwing him against the wall, you know, energetically. He said, if you ever make her feel uncomfortable again, I'll kill you. Or something like that. Brad was there for Gwyneth when she needed someone to help her. And you can see how much it moves her emotionally even 20 years later. He leveraged his fame and power to protect me at a time when I didn't have fame or power yet. Right. Wow. It moves you. It moves you. Yeah. It was, it was fantastic. Good for him. Yeah, he's a good person. Oh, you must have just, you know. People remember who is there for them when life gets hard. A small inconvenience or sacrifice on your end can have a huge emotional impact on someone else. Now, that said, it's important to recognize that not everyone you go out of your way to help will stay in your life or even be grateful for it in the moment. But over a lifetime, if you make it a habit to be there to help and support the people you care about, you will end up with some amazing relationships. Okay, let's quickly run through today's tips to help them stick. First, strengthen your first impression with charismatic body language. Make warm, soft eye contact. Speak through a smile. Let that smile reach your eyes. And use expansive gestures when you speak. As the conversation progresses, you can capture people's attention using a pre-story laugh or a one-sentence hook. Once you've made a charismatic first impression, you want to make sure people feel good around you. This can be done with kindness and compliments or by making them laugh. And once you've established a relationship with someone, keep an eye out for when they're going through something difficult and try to support them. Now, there's a lot of advice in this video, and it can be overwhelming to know where to start and how to actually implement it. After all, you don't just want to learn charisma facts, you want to live it. That's why we made our 30-day program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step video course that comes with a daily action guide to show you how to take what you're learning and turn it into unthinking habits so that you start to radiate confidence and charisma naturally without trying. The program comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, so if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can just give yourself a refund from inside the program. We've had thousands of people go through Charisma University, and the average review they give us is a 9 out of 10. Here's the type of impact members get from the program in their own words. The term life-changing is thrown around a lot when online personal development courses, and I can't think of any course I've taken that I would describe that way except for this one. I couldn't recommend this course more. The wonderfully simple actions yield incredible results and make you feel so much better about yourself. It has truly been incredible. I've instantly had results that seem insane. So many more meaningful connections, my friendships have improved, and my interactions with total strangers are a new, exciting, fulfilling thing. I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system. I had an interview on day 8 when we had the visualization action guide, and I couldn't have been more happy with the results. I walked into the interview feeling so confident. Everything I imagined down to the laughter of others came true, and I got the job on the first interview.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"When it comes to dating, most people don't have as many options as they'd like. Level with me. What are my chances? Not good. Or the options you do have feel like settling and you have this nagging feeling that you want to do better. Then you see someone who consistently dates out of their league. How do they do it? In this video, we'll break down the start to several unlikely celebrity couples and use them to show you 7 tips to help you date out of your league. So you're telling me there's a chance. Yeah! Later in the video, we'll explain why leagues are problematic, but for now, assume out of your league refers to anyone you believe is above you in attractiveness, wealth, fame, or social status. We'll be focusing on men interacting with women since that's my own personal experience, but similar principles will apply no matter who you like. Okay, so let's start with a few examples that have one thing in common. See if you can guess what step one is for dating out of your league. Okay, so Saturday Night Live comedians date out of their league. Who else tends to? There are plenty of photographers who aren't rich or famous, but date incredibly attractive models. And it's not uncommon for backup dancers to date out of their league, with examples like Chris Judd and Jennifer Lopez or Jorge Santos and Christina Aguilera. What do they all have in common? They have access. Simply put, most people never even have a chance to talk to JLo, let alone guarantee hours on set together. So what's the advice here? Making your career just to meet more people is a bit extreme, but there's another easy way to improve your access to people who are out of your league. Listen to how Kevin Federline met Britney Spears when she was the world's biggest pop star. Kevin wasn't just some random guy, he was friends with Britney's friends. A common mistake guys make when trying to improve their dating lives is to only talk to people they're attracted to. But when you go out, you're much better off talking to everybody. For starters, it's more attractive if someone sees you at the center of a bunch of people telling stories and making them laugh, rather than stalking alone around the venue. And you never know when you'll make a random new friend who ends up transforming your social life. One other quick point on access, while you don't want to pick your career just to meet people, if you're genuinely interested in something but you worry your friends will tease you for it, like taking dance classes if you're a straight man, do it anyway. Otherwise, you're not pursuing an interest you may love and you're guaranteeing you don't have access to the other people doing it. But access alone won't get you far. If someone is high status or extremely beautiful, even if they aren't a celebrity, they have had hundreds, possibly thousands of people approach them trying to date them. So you have to stand out from the average person who approaches them. For instance, in her heyday, everyone who saw Britney Spears would freak out trying hard to get her attention. I would do anything just to get a glimpse of her in person. I'm gonna be shaking nervous. Contrast that with how she describes Kevin's demeanor when they met and you can start to understand why she was attracted to him. He was very mysterious. He just seemed not fazed by anything. I saw her as a normal person, you know? I never treated her any different than any other normal person. Kevin didn't treat her like a fan. For a woman like Britney who's used to men throwing themselves at her, that unfazed attitude set him apart from everyone else and made him attractive. That said, simply being unfazed isn't always enough to attract someone. So let's go through three specific ways you can stand out in a positive attractive way. The first is by playfully teasing. This is a great flirting habit in general and is especially great if someone is used to being surrounded by yes-men and flatterers. Here's a few quick examples with Craig Ferguson teasing women he's attracted to. I have to say I'm from Newton, Mairns. Oh, that's the posh part of Glasgow. She went in to make sure I said that. Yeah, it's very posh. That's like saying, oh yeah, I'm from the hood. And then you go, which part? And you say, Beverly Hills. You should spell on you. You're freaking me out. I'm putting spells on you. Yeah, you've already done that. You did that when you did the knee. That's why you see me move back like that. You did. You're crawling away. No, no. The distance is hurting me. No, listen, it has to be. Very cool. Don't you do well in the cold? I mean, I like snow for like a minute. Like, I love to ski but like... See, that's not skiing. This is no skiing. Ski? Yeah, yeah. I'm not sure that's skiing either. Here's one more quick example with Katie and Russell from right before they started dating. The footage isn't great quality because it's behind-the-scenes footage but you can see their banter is far from non-stop compliments. The thing is coming again! Russell, wait! I'm dilly-dallying at this point because we might f*** up the atmosphere but I'm clear off. If you like the idea of playful teasing but you worry about coming off like an asshole, check out our video featuring Craig Ferguson about how to confidently flirt with anyone. It lays out some ways you can playfully tease and feel confident you'll get a laugh. We'll link to it in the description and at the end of this video. Playfully teasing someone of high status or beauty does two things at once. It makes them laugh which builds rapport and it also helps you stand out compared to the exclusively complimentary people who are scared to say anything the person won't like. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the occasional compliment. Compliments can be flattering. But if all you do is compliment someone, it can be off-putting. For a bit of a cringy example, imagine yourself as Britney in this next clip. Who are the flowers for? They are for Miss Britney Spears, the one and only. Britney, I love you. This is an honor just to even be standing in front of you, my huge fan. This is a dream come true to even be so close to you. Being overly complimentary isn't the only way you can accidentally make yourself less attractive to someone. Another common mistake is saying what you think they want to hear. For a common example of how people act subordinate to people they admire, check out the scene from the movie Trainwreck. It's a joke but unfortunately, it's not far off from what a lot of real conversations look like when someone's trying to make someone else like them. Do you follow sports? Oh, my God. Sports? I love them. What are your favorite teams? I like smaller teams, not the big leagues. I like the Long Island mediums. The acorn pine cones. If your version of being nice is to be agreeable no matter what, you should stop. This won't build attraction especially with someone who gets treated this way by everyone. In fact, if you want to be attractive, do the opposite. Prioritize being honest above saying what you think they want to hear. If they're extremely attractive or high status, this will instantly make you stand out from most people in their lives. Watch this for a great example with Kevin and Brittany. This is very soon after they first met. How do you feel about marriage and commitment? I feel that love is love. Love has... Love is... I don't think we need marriage. You can hear the disappointment in her voice. This was clearly not the answer she was looking for. But dishonesty only made her more attracted to him. I kind of was playing reverse psychology. I don't like you so I'm gonna ask you about marriage, you know. So I think that's why I probably did all that which really screwed me because I ended up falling for him even more. This was doubly attractive because in addition to being honest, it makes him a bit of a challenge. Flirting with someone who's hard to get can be fun for someone who's used to everyone always being available to them. The number one way most people screw this up is by doing the opposite and being available at all times. If you want to be attractive, don't treat someone you've just met like they're the only good thing in your life. It's a bit of an extreme example here but listen to how Jason Sudakis hooked Olivia Wilde by not showing the intense immediate interest that most men were giving her at the time. He's just really like cool. He played it really cool. Once we started like texting a little bit... Really witty texts, right? When he got my number, he didn't text me for a month. I was like, this is incredible. Oh my goodness. He really... I was on the hook. Just like Brittany, you can see Olivia was hooked by the fact that Jason was a challenge to get. Now, it's important to mention here, neither of these last two examples was done to be a mind game. Kevin genuinely didn't believe in marriage at the time and Jason simply had other things going on. Listen to him explain as much to Stephen Colbert in this next clip. I just didn't make any sort of moves. Is that the trick? Show no interest? No, just don't... I think so. You hear that sometimes. But all I did was like I was just very, very busy with other things. A lot of dating advice you'll see online is about finding attractive behavior and trying to copy it without modeling where it comes from. And when you just copy the behavior, you can end up coming across as fake, which will blow any chance you have with someone. So instead of trying to fake it, the key is to genuinely have other stuff going on in your life. This will automatically make you behave more attractively. For instance, most people without much going on in their life are attached to their phones, so they see new texts right away. Then you stress about artificially delaying your response so you don't seem needy. But if you're out surfing in the ocean or playing guitar in a jam session with friends, you won't have to worry about how long you should wait to text someone because you won't even see their text for hours. So build a life where this random person you just met isn't the best thing in it. Then you'll naturally do the most attractive thing. Also, it's important to note you don't have to wait a month before you ask someone out or hide your romantic intentions. Here's Russell Brand as a counterexample. Both of these clips are from before he and Katie started dating. I'm supposed to say that music is the real winner tonight but Katie Perry didn't win an award and she's staying in the same hotel as me so she's going to need a shoulder crown. So in a way, I'm the real winner tonight. Thank you very much. Actually, this is an item that I like to call flimsily veiled excuse to chat up a woman by getting her on the radio show and you're in the middle of that now. It's pretty obvious that he's into Katie. But even still, Russell doesn't act like getting Katie is the most important thing in his life. In this next clip, Katie seems open to his flirting but Russell doesn't immediately jump on it and act desperate to make it happen. As a tangent, Russell's flirting is so well received partially because of his persona. He flirts with everyone. So even when he's directly hitting on you, it can be hard to tell if he's actually interested. Okay, so playfully tease, be honest when it's scary and don't immediately prioritize the person above everything else in your life. Well, how are you supposed to do that when just standing near the person probably makes you nervous? The first thing to do when you're nervous is recognize that being nervous isn't a character defect. Everyone gets nervous from time to time, even Russell Brand. That said, there are a few things you can do to minimize your nervousness. If you're meeting someone for the first time either because you see them at an event or because it's a blind date, one trick is to warm up socially before you talk to them. Turning on your charisma at a moment's notice is a skill and not everyone is naturally good at it without practice. If that's you, then don't make the person you're intimidated by the first person you speak to at an event. Warm up by talking to your Uber driver, the bouncer, the bartender, the hostess, really anyone who's around. Get into a talkative mood and you'll find it way easier to start speaking to someone you're attracted to. Second, if conversation goes well and you exchange information, don't spend time on their social media. Social media plays a big role in convincing you that someone has the status, power, or otherworldly filtered looks that make you feel like they're out of your league. And third, have standards beyond fame, wealth, or beauty. The average person's internal dialogue when talking to someone attractive is I hope this person likes me. Having standards means that part of the conversation is meant to genuinely see if you like them. You'll instantly feel more confident once you stop treating conversation like a one-sided tryout. This will help your nerves and help you be more attractive. It will also help you avoid relationships that ultimately make you miserable. A good question to ask yourself right now is what personality traits does someone need to have to be in your life if they don't have status, wealth, or good looks? Then, don't let anyone into your life if they don't have those traits regardless of their status, wealth, or good looks. This is helped tremendously by recognizing that ultimately, dating out of your league is a bad goal. Often, the goal to date someone out of your league comes from insecurity. A good way to test this is when you think about dating this person, do you think about how you would enjoy their company? Or do you think about how great it makes you look or how cool other people will think you are? There's nothing wrong with dating someone who's beautiful or wealthy or famous. But if you prioritize dating out of your league over dating someone that treats you well, you're setting yourself up to be miserable. That said, finding the right person can be hard if you aren't good at presenting yourself. If you're someone who has few dating options, it can be very tempting to settle for the best you can do even if you know they aren't really that great for you. If you want to learn how to be more confident and attractive in conversation so that you can have options and never have to settle, you may like our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program that will show you how to have a magnetic presence when you walk into a room, enter any conversation with confidence, and make an amazing first impression on anyone you meet. It takes just 20 to 30 minutes a day and each day comes with a daily action guide so you know exactly how to put everything you're learning into practice. And it's sequential with each day building upon the last. It also comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee so the only way you pay anything is if you think it was worth more than the money you invested. I could go on about the program but rather than tell you what I think, let's take a look at what some of the members have said about their experience after the program. The first one comes from a guy who says CU helped his dating life. He says, Firstly, loving the course. I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation module. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we're dating. This next one comes from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I had, hands down, the best interview of everybody and that they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. And this last one is a comment in the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their dating life and he says, Life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Changing someone's mind is hard. I'm not listening. I'm not listening. Part of the problem is that we often trigger one another's emotional defenses before the content of our arguments can be evaluated and that is why, in this video, I want to give you five do's and don'ts to actually change someone's minds who may vehemently disagree with you and we will be using Steven Crowder's Change My Mind segment to do it. Two caveats before we begin. First, I will only be showing Steven for the examples of behavior that I'm referring to. He's had guests who have illustrated both the do's and the don'ts but he's the face so he is the one that I will be using. Second, this has nothing to do with who is right either morally or logically. Sound logic is, of course, important especially when it comes to forming your own beliefs but this video focuses on the interpersonal guidelines so that you can learn to communicate more productively. So, our first point is that when it comes to persuasion, you are best served to go slow. Just about anything that gives you and the other person a rest from barrage of point-counterpoint can do the trick. Steven has an opportunity built into the beginning of the segment where he explains what's about to happen. This is designed to be a discussion that hopefully opens a civil dialogue, I believe, in searching for the truth. My presupposition is that there are two genders and if you would like to change my mind on that, you're more than welcome. But Steven also catches when people are making points that aren't responding to one another and he often suggests that people cause to catch up to one another. Can I ask you a question? Sure. I appreciate you taking the time and I appreciate you being civil. I think we're maybe missing each other here. Can you explain to me? Someone crosses the, let's say, Mexican-American border, right? You can do the same thing if you're ever feeling lost in an argument or if it ever looks like the person that you're talking to isn't quite understanding the point that you're trying to make. This far less effective from a persuasion standpoint is going quickly. Now, from a logical perspective, this may sound counterintuitive. After all, if you know that your point requires four supporting pillars, you may be tempted to get them all out there ASAP so that you can save time and wrap the discussion up but this is actually counterproductive because when people are offered information that clashes with their belief systems, they'll often disagree reflexively if they aren't given time to integrate the new information. This leads us to our second point which is a particular form of slowing down that is the most important piece of changing someone's mind and that is building rapport because if someone doesn't like you, the odds that you change their mind approach zero and then we see Stephen build rapport in a number of ways that to a logician might seem entirely useless. For instance, in those situations where you might know just a little about someone, establishing the basics of their life can be essential. Now, let me ask you this — you said you come from your first-generation immigrant family. Yes, I am. So could you tell me a little bit about your family and your parents? Similarly, if you have something positive to say, you don't need to hold back because you're in an argument. In fact, it's best to let those compliments fly. Dig the shoes. Okay. Also incredibly useful is establishing commonalities. It might seem silly but sharing a hobby, an acquaintance, or a location that you've lived in immediately makes people feel that you are like them which makes them view your position with less suspicion. I grew up in Longview, East Texas. I have an in-law from Longview, actually. Longview, you would go to Tyler, right? Is that where they had the big escalator? Yeah. Okay. To be clear, rapport building is not something that should be done simply at the beginning of an interaction and then cast aside in favor of syllogisms. Especially when things get heated, it is important to allow the flow of argument to break. This communicates that the relationship is more important than who is right. Watch Steven break after 10 minutes of discussion in this next clip. Very welcoming people. Yeah, yeah. Very welcoming. Food was a big thing. Yeah, food was a big thing. I mean, we would sit and I learned the squishy bread and all that stuff. Yes. I didn't like it at first. The texture was a little weird. You have to dip it in the sauce. Right. Now, the opposite of building rapport is breaking rapport and while it might sound obvious, you don't want to do this if your goal is to persuade the person with whom you're talking. Yes, breaking rapport can get a crowd behind you and that's partially why Christopher Hitchens' hitch slap compilations have become so popular. You give me the awful impression — I hate to have to say it — of someone who hasn't read any of the arguments against your position ever. If it's of interest, we can cover the insult argument in the future but for the purposes of this video, we won't dive any deeper because those hitch slaps don't change the mind of the person with whom you are speaking. Similarly, these insults do not work when it comes to changing someone's mind so don't do stuff like this. ... Who are you arguing with? You're Don Quixote fighting windmills, man. I know you like to sound really intelligent by speaking in paragraphs. One thing — you've misused words several times and if someone were to call you on it and be as rude as you are, you might look what you might refer to as stupid. Okay, so you're using it in an insulting way. You can say that. A little bit of banter. A little bit of — yeah, well, we don't call that friendly banter generally. We call that being a dick. ... You may have noticed that Steven mentioned that he felt he had been disrespected first and I'm not trying to say whose fault it is but I do want to highlight that if you get to a point where insults have been hurled, you're no longer changing minds but competing in a dominance game. And I'd recommend our video on Russell Brand for how you can go about disarming these attacks without insulting someone back instead with humor and get back to genuine persuasion but for this video, it's enough to say that insults aren't doing anything to help you change someone's mind and winning an insult argument isn't going to get you very far in that department. Now, as the conversation moves along, inevitably, you run into areas where you're going to disagree. That's kind of the point of these types of arguments and the instinct here is to fact-check or push back at every single opportunity. In fact, that's what many of the people who sit down with Steven do — they immediately disagree despite knowing only a three-to-fives word summary of Steven's position. A better strategy is to resist the urge to point fight and instead, wait until you deeply understand the other person's position before you begin to disagree. Concretely, you should attempt to concisely summarize how the other person feels like you see Steven do here. So you're saying that sex and gender are very different? Yes. Okay, I understand. So that's your premise — re-transformation of society based on — from what I'm hearing from you, unless I'm mistaken — abstracts. I haven't heard a number. I haven't heard what defines male or female, only how people feel. And I just — that's — to me, that's not very convincing or conducive toward a productive society. So I want to make sure that I'm understanding your reasoning for why it is a baby outside versus inside the womb, even though it's the same age. You are saying that location and that determines whether it's a human life because, in fact, when it's inside the womb, it is not a separate human being. It is a part of the mother. Yes. Okay. I've not misrepresented you there. I understand you correctly. Yeah. Not only does this technique prevent you from wasting time debating positions your partner doesn't even hold but it satisfies a core emotional need for anyone who might change their mind and that is to feel that they've been personally validated — repeating their position back to them, asking for clarification — that is an effective way to do that. For illustration of how the opposite can hamper discussion, watch the student's face here when Steven tells him he leans left politically even when that student has previously said that he doesn't. I would argue no and I think that's because, again, this is more of a leftist view. I know you said you're not really liberal but I can tell you by your worldview in economics that you do lean more left because you're seeing it as a zero-sum game. Wealthy people can't get wealthy off of the backs of poor people if they make them more poor. So if you find someone verbally or visibly disagreeing with your characterization of their stance, pause and clarify. If you don't, it won't matter how many points you score. You're not going to change their mind. Similarly, when it comes time to share your own perspective, no matter how certain you may be, it is usually best not to state your beliefs as objective truths. Instead, use language that makes clear you're speaking from your individual perception of reality like here. Based on from what I'm hearing from you, unless I'm mistaken, abstracts. I haven't heard a number. I haven't heard what defines male or female, only how people feel and, to me, that's not very convincing or conducive toward a productive society. ...seemed pretty upset. I would say that you were shouting but I guess you don't see it that way and that's okay, by the way. I don't begrudge you. What is it that you wanted to clarify for me? Great phrases for this can include, the way that I see things or unless I'm wrong or according to the studies that I've read. These make people less likely to get defensive at being flatly told that their position is objectively wrong. The opposite of this would be laying claim to objective reality that contradicts the other person. Okay, so everything you've just said is inaccurate. This can sound frustrating especially if you are certain that you are right and the other person is wrong. Why would you want to not claim objective truth? But it's important because presenting your beliefs as tentative understandings rather than unchanging truths is more than just rhetorical. Your study may, in fact, be misleading. The research that you're citing may be upturned in five years time and the words that you heard that other person say just a moment before might be misremembered. There is always a chance that you are mistaken so it's not only more persuasive but also more precise to add these types of qualifiers. One caveat here is that people on the fence will often be persuaded by confident proclamations that reveal no doubt but when you're talking to someone who disagrees with you, it's much better to use qualifiers. Now, when it comes to winning, the problem here is that if there is a clear winner, there is necessarily a clear loser so try not to highlight your opponent's concessions or contradictions with uproar. You want to frame the discussion not as a tug of war which you have won but as a search for agreements to which you both contributed. For example, we both agree if someone sought to nationalize the press, that would be a problem. That'd be a step toward fascism, right? Would we both agree on that? Yes. Okay, good, good. So we have some common ground there. The opposite of this practice would be dunking on someone — making a show of the moments where they've contradicted themselves or moved to your side. Take a look at the student's reaction here. It's reflexively defensive and unconvinced. The rich, the upper class, see? It's a different classism. Hitler's, you know, we say the one percent, Hitler said the Jews. So the point is, no, no, it's not a false equivalency. Just know that if you do dunk and you make a big deal out of these moments, you're very likely to take all that hard work that you put in and throw it away. So even if you feel the other person has been a jerk or they've debated in bad faith or insulted you, don't gloat in victory. Just calmly call out that it seems like you agree. It doesn't matter that you've been perceived to win if your goal was to change someone's mind because that has been accomplished. Now, as I was finishing this video, Stephen released another Change My Mind and at the end of it, the professor with whom Stephen is speaking has one of the more profound reversals of opinion that I've seen in all the Change My Minds that I've watched. Yeah, I'm saying the best student should be the one who gets into school. I agree. So, again, we go back to the beginning of this thing. I said it's not racist and now I'm thinking maybe it could be. What's most interesting here is that Stephen and the professor spent most of their time just talking about life, their stories, joking around, even having the students do a hip-hop wave at the end. They barely touched on statistics and as mentioned, this is possible because one of the most powerful ways to change someone's mind is to build strong rapport. Building rapport creates trust, mutual understanding, and likability and without those, you can't be influential, persuasive, or inspiring and this goes beyond just debating whether you're asking for a raise, selling a product, trying to land a date, or leading a team. Your success heavily depends on how well you can build rapport and if you want the ability to quickly build rapport with just about anyone that you want, you should definitely check out Charisma University. Charisma University is our flagship step-by-step guided program that is guaranteed to make you more charismatic and confident in just 30 days and when you are extremely charismatic and confident, building rapport, being persuasive, and influencing people can become second nature. Now, Charisma University also comes with a daily action guide that makes it super simple for you to form charismatic habits so this is all second nature — you don't have to think about it. All that you have to do is follow the guide and you will get the results. Now, we've had thousands of people go through this program and get life-changing outcomes and this is what some of the members have to say. So the first one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position very early in his career and he says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet they want me to fill this position and when I asked why this was the answer, they said, You have great social skills which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you have taught me. You have truly changed my life because without Charisma University, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. Now, this next member writes, Thank you so much for creating Charisma University. This is a game-changer that changed how I approach my boss, my peers, and strangers. It gave me the guts to stand up for myself and others, start a business, and engage others. Even after the 30-day program, I still feel like there's so much track to run on and I'm just getting started. And now this last member for today says, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. Even one-on-one, I'd struggle to make connections half the time but after Charisma University, I am way more confident in saying what I think and feel even in bigger group settings. I feel much more happy all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman that I've had a crush on for a year and make a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep coming back to it whenever I need a refresher. Thank you so much for making it. Now, this is just the tip of the iceberg. You can see many more success stories like these in our course comments if you do decide to join. Now, Charisma University also comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason whatsoever and it's 60 days even though the course is only 30 so that you can go through risking absolutely nothing if you decide to join. And that means you either become a more charismatic and confident version of yourself in 30 days or if you're not satisfied, you can, of course, get every single penny back. So go ahead, click on the link on your screen or the link in the description to find out more about Charisma University if that is appealing to you. Also, with New Year's coming up, this can be one of the best resolutions that you ever make. Anyway, I hope that you've liked today's video. I wish you a happy new year in advance and as always, I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 0}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We all handle relationships in different ways and one powerful way to understand these differences is through the lens of attachment theory. According to psychologists, there are four main attachment styles which have profound effects on our relationships and in this video, we're going to break down those different styles using iconic characters and show you how you can use this knowledge to improve your relationships with everyone around you. The first type is the avoidant. The avoidant is marked by their discomfort with deep connection and in real life, you can think of the person who ghosts out of budding relationships or feels that any display of emotion is overkill. You can see it in moments as simple as hugs. That's not a hug. I'm just grabbing the door for you. We're not — we're not there yet. It can come through even more subtly such as avoiding eye contact in situations where either person is likely to get emotional. In this case, we're Tony dubs Peter an Avenger for the first time which he knows is something that means the world to him. You're an Avenger now. This discomfort with connection can lead to rather creative ways to avoid it that go beyond just the physical. One simple way is to invest much more in the beginning phases of a relationship than in the later phases. This way, the avoidant can enjoy the exciting aspects of relationships while escaping when that deeper connection threatens to form. In fact, avoidance can make for very charming daters but often for upsetting long-term partners. In addition to simply disappearing, another common tactic of the avoidant is to use humor to quickly defuse situations that might become too emotional. It's one of their most effective tactics because their fear of intimacy is well hidden behind smiles and sarcasm. You see it, for instance, in Good Will Hunting when Will trolls all of his therapists as they try to reach out to him. Sky rockets in flight, afternoon to light, hey, afternoon to light. As you see there, avoidance can often be funny in a very irreverent way which makes us think that they've got everything under control. They will also use that biting sense of humor to control others when they begin to open up to them. They're prone to shame any sort of display of emotion and return to the limited connection that they are much more comfortable with. Dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I guess he won because that was six years ago. Hmm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need. Like all attachment types, the avoidant is created in childhood. Something occurred that made the avoidant associate connection with pain hence the tremendous unconscious effort that they exert to escape it. A typical story is that one or both parents were physically present but emotionally unavailable and Tony Stark typifies this childhood experience. What do you remember about your dad, huh? He was cold. He was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me. It's only through great effort in the later movies that we see Tony Stark to overcome this blockage that he has to connection which is good news if you are an avoidant yourself because you too can change. One thing you can do today is to simply send a thank-you letter, an email, a text, or better yet, tell someone in person how much they mean to you and look them in the eye while you do it. The second type is the anxious type and those are the inverse of the avoidant. They fear the loss of connection. Now, they're often in relationships or hopping from one to another and the psychological reason for this is simple. For an anxious type, being without a cherished connection can feel like dying and it's no mistake that they often describe it that way saying, you're my everything or the thought of not being with you. I can't breathe. Unconsciously, anxious types sometimes use the pain of being without their loved one to control the person that they're in a relationship with. They make the other person fear their own suffering and they fear it so much that they might not break up with that person even if the relationship is failing. Other times, they literally might threaten self-harm though this doesn't happen always. Now, in The Notebook, it is played as romantic but take this out of the Hollywoodization and you have an extremely unhealthy example of anxious style threats and obsession. Will you go out with me? What? No. No? No. No. Hey, Pat, she just told you. Why not? I don't know because I don't want to. All right, well, you leave me no other choice then. Oh my god. The Notebook and Star Wars get another aspect of the anxious type's romantic behaviors correct. Obsession can form before really even knowing an individual. Noah threatens to kill himself after staring at Allie. That is as long as they have seen one another in their lives. Anakin remains obsessed with Padme for years without even seeing her. What is really happening in these situations if you've experienced something similar in your own life is that the anxious type is projecting an idealized image onto the object of their affection. Their low self-image can blind them to the flaws of others making them willing to change anything just to be close to that person. I can be whatever you want. You just tell me what you want and I'll be that for you. Unfortunately, the anxious type's low self-image also makes them suspect that that perfect object of their desire could never really want to be with them — not for long anyway. So even when they may be in a relationship with that person, they tend to cling tightly. Eventually, all that clinging turns to suspicion and they drive people away confirming what they've suspected all along. Liar! No! You're with him! You brought him here to kill me! No! Like the avoidant, the reason anxious types are both needy of attention and expecting of abandonment goes back to childhood. Obviously, there can be many factors but the loss of a cherished caretaker at a young age can cause this as we see with both Anakin and Peter Parker who exhibits these to a smaller degree. Connection is felt to be valuable but impermanent and thus must always be safeguarded. Now, if you are an anxious type, a good stepping stone is to cultivate a hobby or skill that has nothing to do with relationships — something that you can do by yourself. Having those style of things going on in your life makes it so that you don't base your entire identity and self-worth simply on other people. Next up, we have the fearful type and thankfully, this type is very rare compared to the others making up roughly 2% of the population but it does combine the most challenging traits of the anxious and avoidant types — they can be unpredictable and they find ways to sabotage the very things that they seem to want the most. One of the main attributes of these fearful types is that they bounce between that anxious behavior like the people-pleasing that we see from Nebula in Endgame and the hatred and the fear that we see just a short time later in that timeline. You're going to kill my father? You dare to oppose me? You see what he has turned me into? You kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets. And though I previously mentioned him as an avoidant example, as we see more of Will in Good Will Hunting, it becomes clear that he is truly a fearful type. He displays avoidance early in his relationships and then extreme anxiety when Skyler invites him out to California to connect deeper. He can't believe that she would want to stay with him. You just want to have your little fling with like the guy from the other side of town and then you're gonna go off to Stanford, you're gonna marry some rich prick who your parents will approve of and just sit around with the other trust fund babies and talk about how you went slumming too once. Will, being a fearful type, craves yet is uncomfortable with the affection that comes in a relationship which makes him lash out unpredictably at the people he cares the most about and we see his fear and anger boil over in this exact pattern. I look like I need that? No, God. I just want to be with you because I love you. Don't bullshit me! Don't you fucking bullshit me! If you've ever known someone who can't seem to find a stable relationship no matter who they date who becomes more violent as they get closer to someone, you may have witnessed a fearful type in action. Now in terms of childhood, fearful types are often victims of trauma which may have included verbal, physical, or sexual abuse. They may have felt that they had no one that they could rely on for love. Nebula, for instance, was torn apart and berated by Thanos. Her sister was pitted against her. Will was beaten by his foster dad after being abandoned and orphaned. The fearful type has the most robust defense mechanisms because in their experience, vulnerability means ultimate pain which means that in those rare emotional moments when the vulnerability is threatening to expose itself, you can see just about every defense mechanism under the sun come back to back to back and Goodwilch Hunting did an excellent job of portraying this. This is not your fault. I know. Look at me, son. It's not your fault. I know. It's not your fault. I know. No, no, you don't. It's not your fault. I know. It's not your fault, all right? It's not your fault. Don't fuck with me. Not your fault. Don't fuck with me, all right? Don't fuck with me, John. Not you. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. Now, if this seems like you, it is often the case that childhood trauma can be at the root of this issue and it's best to move through these with professional guidance. Be sure, though, to find someone that you have some rapport with because trust is a necessary piece of addressing these traumas. Lastly, we have the secure type and unfortunately, we don't see a whole lot of these types in romantic movies because they don't tend to be very dramatic. They don't cling or run and it's because unlike all the other types, the relationships of that secure type are not driven by fear. That isn't to say that they don't feel fear. They simply trust that they have the fortitude to deal with the inevitable heartache that comes from deeper connections. Don't put your shit on me when you're the one that's afraid. I'm afraid? What am I afraid of? What the fuck am I afraid of? You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. You know what? I'm afraid too. Fuck it. I want to give it a shot and at least I'm honest with you. Secure types can trust others to see them in vulnerable moments because of an unconscious belief that they can open up without immediately being burned for it. They're also comfortable in conflict because they aren't afraid of abandonment. When they disagree with someone, they tend to do so in a calm manner. Cap doesn't have to raise his voice, his tempo usually stays even, and he doesn't point fingers or throw his hands up in exasperation. Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. And when it comes to working with others, they don't have a one-size-fits-all solution. They don't need to be mindlessly independent or fearfully group-oriented. They can treat each situation separately, deciding whether their goals are best suited by working alone or by relying on others. How are you guys planning on beating that? Together. The common thread with the secure type is that they are not reenacting their childhood trauma so they can treat each new relationship as it is. They're not just focused on whether or not there is a connection but on the quality of that connection. They keep the good ones and discard the bad. In the case of the relationship with Tony in Civil War, Cap doesn't have to run back to him because he's terrified of being alone. Neither does he have to cast him aside forever because he's afraid of getting hurt. Instead, he apologizes first and he offers a path to reconciliation because he respects and trusts Tony's moral compass. I wish we agreed on the accords. I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should. Now, we don't see much of Steve's childhood in the MCU but you get the sense that he received ample love and consistently got his needs met. He also had a long friendship with Bucky. Instead of the competitive relationship like Nebula had with Gamora, Bucky was always looking out for him showing him support when he most needed it. Thank you, Buck but I can get by on my own. The thing is, you don't have to. I'm with you to the end of the line, pal. If you're a secure type, congratulations. You're doing well and you probably had a strong upbringing but, of course, no one falls fully into any of these categories. Keep your eyes out for behaviors and motivations that might indicate anxious or avoidant tendencies and recognize that not being driven by fear doesn't automatically mean you always act exactly like you might wish so brushing up on some other videos of ours regarding relationships couldn't hurt. So I hope this helped you learn about your relationship style and potentially to improve it. Quick announcement that we now have a podcast and it is not necessarily charisma related but hopefully still entertaining so if you want to check that out, there's a highlight channel link below and, of course, here in the corner. We'll be uploading full podcast once we nail the format but, for now, it's highlights. Also, if you are interested in improving your relationship starting from the beginning, you might want to check out a video that I made that explains the four emotions you want to create every time to make an amazing first impression. Create them in the right order, you're going to make an amazing impression and if you skip them, do them out of order, you might not.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"So today is a very exciting day because someone who I consider to be one of the most charismatic people in the world, Russell Brand, himself has made a video on how to be charismatic and this can always be very interesting when you're learning from someone who seems to get it naturally. I don't know all of Russell's story but he did come up as an actor, he was a comedian, and so he might have internalized a lot of the traits that make someone charismatic so it'll be very interesting to see if we have commonalities in how we see charisma. My suspicion is that he, like many people who seems to just get it, might boil it down to just be yourself. But I'm not totally sure, we're gonna see if that's the case and here we go. Now, I reckon that the secret to charisma is being able to be present. In fact, people speak frequently, don't they, of presence, this person has a real presence. A couple of things here, I definitely agree with him in that at the deepest and perhaps the highest levels of charisma, what you do want to fall back on is be yourself, be present in the moment that enables you to react authentically and spontaneously to everything that comes up without needing canned lines. Part of the problem is that telling someone to be present or to just be themselves is kind of like asking someone to hop over a 20-foot wall their first day trying gymnastics. It tends to be very, very difficult to people. I do think that the way to get there is with intermediate easier steps, so I'm curious if he will talk at all about that. Not all of us will find the same people charismatic, the same ways we don't all have good sexual chemistry or good convivial friendship type chemistry between one another. There are certain ways that we interlock. This is actually something that I think is very important. People will ask questions of me and then they'll want to know what is wrong with the way that they're presenting themselves. Do they have a core charisma issue? And the question that I always ask them is, is this something that has happened once or twice or is this a consistent thing in your life? Because to Russell's point, no matter what you do, if you are the most charismatic person on the planet, you're not going to be everyone's cup of tea. One of the best tips I ever heard about charisma comes from Russell and it was when I saw him on the Logan Paul podcast. It happens now. When I arrive here and I see these players, even wordlessly, my emotions inform me. Oh, what's it going to be like? Is everyone going to like me? What's going to happen to me? Who are these men? What's happening here? Like all this stuff starts happening and then another part of me goes, you've got nothing to get. No one can give you anything. You're all right. You don't have to be afraid. All you're ever able to do is be of service to other people and if you get distracted from that objective and start thinking that your life is about getting things, you know pain is coming because I've experienced it many, many times. When you're entering into communion, you're talking to other people, you're having a dialogue with them. Don't go into it thinking that they have something to give you, whether it's you could get a date, get a job, etc. Though that might always be in the back of your mind. If you recognize that they, at some fundamental level, cannot make you happy, the pressure comes off of that interaction. It becomes much more fun and easier to be your authentic self. Or if I'm in a social situation and I still do suffer from some social anxiety, one of the ways I overcome it is by making a decision to really genuinely listen to the person that I'm communicating with and let go absolutely of the idea of getting something from that exchange. So this match is actually what I've seen from Russell because I've covered a lot of people and they go on the talk show tours and they tell the same story in the same way over and over and over again. And Russell is perhaps the only person that I don't see do that. He has spontaneous laugh out loud funny jokes in almost every interview that I've ever seen him do. That's not something that comes natural to many people. It's something that needs to be trained if you want to have that sort of communicative style. Hello. How are you? I feel very well today, thank you. So this is a very normal first interaction that you'll have in your life. Someone says, Hi, how are you? You're into this sort of routine pleasantries exchange. Up until now, nothing crazy. Oh, good. I'm so glad. This is your first time here and I'm happy to have you here. I'm very honored to be here in this chair. Oh, really? Yeah, I really like it. Oh, good. So what he's already started to do is to deviate from that normal path. He says, instead of I'm happy to be here, he focuses on the chair, says how he really likes it. Now, he has no idea where he's going to go and he is being present but I want to show you some of the habits that he is really internalized. Watch what he does next. You can come sit in this chair anytime you want. Think what you would say. Someone said, you can come to my house anytime you want. You'll probably say, oh my gosh, thank you. That's so kind of you. What you wouldn't do, usually, is to misinterpret purposely what they said and take it literally but that is exactly what Russell does because it's a staple of comedy taking something literally that is not meant to be taken literally. Do you think there will be times when it's impractical? If someone's in it? For example. Yes. It depends on who's in it. They may enjoy you sitting on their lap. It may lift the interview. Mm-hmm. So now he's sort of developing and he's moved on into another principle of comedy which is say yes and continue to build the world. Again, if you want to work on this stuff, improv comedy when it opens back up is a fantastic way to practice these sorts of techniques and ideas but he's now building a world and this is something that you'll see friends do with each other when they feel really comfortable and in 30 seconds, Russell goes from hello to doing that with Ellen. Take a look and she knows what she's doing. She plays right along. They could be here and then suddenly, I'll be perched on their lap. I don't have to crane around you but it may induce a kind of sexual energy perhaps. Let's try it someday. She yes ends him. Any of your guests... He continues with the yes ending. You can select one at random from a hat and then I'll just come and perch on their knees or if we feel very adventurous, further along towards the groin. I did want to say for Russell, I actually think it's true. The most important thing for him to do in an interaction is to be present, listen, and connect to the other person but if you don't have that same base of deep internalized understanding habits and charisma skills, you might need to work on those first and weirdly enough, it's not actually about being present when you're trying to build new habits. Yes, you're going to remain present as much as you can but there's a part of you that is in your head thinking I want to work on this particular thing. On this realm, on this plane, in this moment, in this time, if you can't be uncluttered from your own mental state, if you can focus on another person, if you cannot be dominated by your own fears, this essentially means you need to spend time working on yourself, ensuring that you deal with your own neurosis, psychosis. This is huge. So a lot of people come to me with charisma questions of all different kinds. The question that they ask is often the presenting surface problem and the real issue is underneath. They can't stop blushing and they want to know how to stop blushing. The deeper problem and they go layers and layers down but, of course, is why do you feel so unsafe, nervous, exposed when you are speaking in front of a group? What is it that you think could happen that would impact you negatively? And we can always say, oh, I could lose my job or somebody wouldn't like me but deep down, as Russell probably has commented before, there tends to be a fear that you will be cast out, that you won't be included, that you don't belong, and that people won't love you. This problem is worth coming at both from that presenting problem of, oh my gosh, I'm blushing, what should I do? In that case, take deep breaths. That's one of the things that can help the fastest because it is flush to your face but also, not just the symptom, you want to go to that core problem. So if you're working on meditation, if you're doing any sort of thing to help your emotional body sort of heal and improve, I think that is the way that I have seen is most effective. Surely there are more subtle forms of energy than air and water that are interrupted and disrupted when a person comes into a room, when a person conveys their energy. The idea that there is an energy when someone walks into a room that we haven't quite been able to measure, it kind of matches my own experience and it seems to go beyond just looking at the person, hearing the person. There is, I don't know, maybe when you look at them, you feel something, that butterflies in your heart or the hairs on your arm go up but there are people when they enter a room that seem to have a literal feel and perhaps we all do but just can't tap into it quite as much. Now, I have to admit as regarding spirituality, for many years, I thought that it was completely useless, lacking in practicality, woo-woo, nonsense. But I will say that there were two big things that really helped me get into it and find tremendous value in it and they're both from Eckhart Tolle. It is a new earth as well as the power of now. Now, both of them still have sentences that I read or hear and they make me cringe with the pseudoscience but there are deep nuggets of wisdom in both of those. The power of now is mostly about the power of getting present in the moment. It's a simple concept but a very deep one that can take a lifetime to start to master. A new earth is a bit more complex and particularly the idea of the pain body, the way that our egos get triggered, was very, very, very useful in my life and something I continue to come back to. So if you haven't gotten much value out of spirituality and you're listening to Russell, you think there might be something there, I highly recommend Eckhart Tolle as a bridge. And you can check out either of those titles for free courtesy of this video's sponsor, Audible. When you join using the link audible.com slash charisma or if you text charisma to 500-500, it comes with one free audiobook right out of the gate. Either by Eckhart is great but A New Earth is my favorite of the two that I mentioned. If you stay after the free trial period, for $14.95, you get an audiobook per month with access to a huge library of audiobooks, podcasts, and more for your ears. A lot of people say that they don't have time to feed their brains, they're too busy, but when you're listening, there's no excuse. So if you want to check out A New Earth, you can do it while you exercise, you're sitting in traffic, or best for Eckhart Tolle by far, just taking a slow leisurely walk. And if you think that spirituality is hippie mumbo-jumbo, I even more highly recommend these titles, they were really, really useful for me and there are sentences that are pseudoscience-y but I think you'll really dig it. So if you want to check one of those out today for free, you can do so at audible.com slash charisma or by texting charisma to 500-500. Either way, I hope that you guys have enjoyed this video. I will be doing a lot more of this style. Let me know what I can improve on, it helps a ton, and I look forward to seeing you in the next video.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all had conversations that started out friendly then suddenly turned into an argument that made us feel attacked. The other person twists your words and uses little tricks to try to make you look dumb. So today, we're going to break down a conversation just like that between Andrew Tate and Piers Morgan to show you how to defend yourself in any argument even if the other person is determined to make you look bad. I don't know why you're trying to come at me with one of his views and pretend that's something to do with me. It's a pretty big view. No, but it's a lame trick, Piers. This video is not endorsing either of these people. It's simply an analysis to teach you the tactics some people use to assert dominance in an argument. The first step to defending yourself from a conversational bully is to spot when they enter fight mode. There's some obvious tells like if someone starts shouting or repeatedly cutting you off, but there's a subtler tell as well. You can see an example of it in this next clip where Piers shows he's there to argue with Andrew not to understand him. I want to play you just a clip off the top. This is from Joe Rogan. He's somebody I absolutely love. Sure. And I think it explains to me what I presume my issue with you is going to be, right? Correct. And you have absolutely got the right to try and persuade me otherwise. Sure. There's actually two tells here. If someone labels you or an idea you stand by as an issue or problematic, that's a good indicator that they've switched into fight mode or if they want to argue with you before asking you to explain your point of view. If that happens, you should start being wary of conversational traps. One of the most common traps is misquoting you. Misquoting you makes it easier for the other person to feel like they're dominating you because they're attacking a straw man instead of your actual views. This sounds like it would be easy to catch but sometimes it only takes a small tweak to your words to make a big impact on their meeting. If you aren't paying attention, you may not notice the small tweak. For example, listen to Andrew respond when Piers asks him, what is your opinion of Alex Jones after meeting him? He was professional and courteous to me. When I meet somebody and they show me respect, I show them back. Respect. That's what I do as I did with you. You respect him? If somebody shows me respect, I show them respect back. If Adolf Hitler showed you respect, you'd respect him back? There is a huge difference between showing someone respect by being polite versus having respect for them and their ideas. Andrew even catches this at first, but Piers is persistent in establishing that straw man. Well, I'm not. I'm taking your position that if somebody shows you respect, you respect them. I think that... I'm saying there are lots of people in the world I do not respect. If Vladimir Putin showed me respect, I would not respect him. That's your opinion, but... No, no. It's my view. What's your view? Okay, that's your view. Well, you're saying... Your view is you would. You can see Piers is trying to force a view upon Andrew that he doesn't actually believe. So you have to be careful not to let someone misquote you or you may find yourself defending a belief that upon reflection, you don't even have. Luckily, there is a simple solution for this if you're aware of it. Re-establish your own point of view before you defend it. You talk about people don't want to see men dressed up in dressy high transgender... That's not exactly what I said. What did you say? I said the reason I am so popular and I'm so famous is that there's a large contingent of men who don't want to wear makeup, who still want to make money, go to the gym, be strong, drive a fast car, be traditionally masculine, and don't want to be shamed for that and they don't want to be called toxic for that. Now, if you do start to make good points in an argument, you'll have to watch out for this next trick, derailing interruptions. This is when someone tries to interrupt you before you can establish your strongest points. You're taking these sentences and on repeat you're using to weaponizing them against me. I'm not weaponizing anything. Okay, it's fine. No, no, you're weaponizing the weaponizing which doesn't exist. No problem. But you said to me, come on, bring it on. This can be frustrating. You see in that clip that the interruptions are starting to bother Andrew. Luckily, there's three ways you can handle being interrupted. The first trick is to pause, acknowledge the person, then return to the point you were making. All I've done is literally read out all the things we identified from all the research that I thought were blatantly misogynist and giving you the chance to respond. And the only time I've interrupted you is when you've tried to answer a completely different question. Understood, Piers. But these things were said. Andrew reclaims the conversation after he looks Piers in the eye and says, understood, Piers. You can even see a little smile in Piers' eyes after. That's because most people in an argument crave to feel heard and understood. Here's another example. You can steal this line word for word if you want to acknowledge someone without agreeing with them. This time, Piers even makes a little positive noise after Andrew acknowledges him. I don't think so. And I think your view of that is, that view is dangerous. I respect that you think my view is dangerous and I respect you have the right to view that, to think that. That line is a nice way to remain connected with someone without giving ground you don't agree with. It makes the other person feel heard and that disarms their need to attack. Now, once someone has established a pattern of interrupting you, the next thing you can do is preempt their interruption. Here's an example. And this is actually what's interesting. And please don't interrupt me on this point. Social media has changed in modern times. You can even see Piers' body language change as he disengages to respect Andrew's request. If the person continues to interrupt you, you can call it out with a one-finger stop gesture. No, no, let's stop for a second. Please don't interrupt me. Here's why you're, I know why you're good at your job. First, you interrupt people a lot, which is good. It's a good skill. I believe in marriage more than anybody. In fact, I believe in marriage. No, please. I believe in marriage in the traditional sense. Now, on the flip side, you also want to avoid the trap of being the interrupter, especially if someone is responding to a point you've made. Don't steamroll concessions. There were a few times where Piers actually made a good point, but he interrupts so much that Andrew can't even agree with him. What you did say at the start of this little exchange, you said, you know, I wouldn't maybe say things the same way now that I did before I was famous. And yet, actually, you've doubled down and said exactly the same thing. On certain points. So that is what you believe. And that's my point. Yes. I'm trying to work out. Look, I don't know you. We just met, right? Steamrolling concessions prevents you from reaching common ground with the person you're talking to. If there's anyone else listening, it also makes it harder for them to register that you've made a good point. Here's one more example. So you can see what not to do. Well, I think my sister is my her husband's property. Yes, because fundamentally, I don't believe a man owns a woman. You do. Well, I don't think a man owns any sovereign individual. I don't think we live in the world of slavery. I don't own any men or any woman, right? Nobody owns when you use phrases like property. That's what you imply. And so my point again is you're a smart guy. We start to interrupt people when we are the ones that enter fight mode. If you can stay calm in an argument, you're much less likely to cut people off and steamroll concessions. One great trick for staying calm in an argument is to physically relax into the argument. Purposefully release any tense muscles and take deep belly breaths. This will signal to your brain that you are safe and you don't need to enter fight or flight. Staying calm also lets you think more clearly. So you're more likely to catch any logical gaps that the person tries to sneak by you. Like the name suggests, this is a moment where there is a gap in the logic of their argument. Here's the most obvious example from this conversation. What is your view of Alex Jones? I think that Alex Jones is a sovereign individual who very much like the rabid left deserves a chance to speak on his points of view. I think that the truth on issues is usually somewhere in the middle between two extremes. So you think Sandy Hook was staged? The logical leap from the truth is somewhere in the middle to so you think Sandy Hook was staged is obvious. But not every logic gap is as easy to pick up on in real time. The key is to remember the premise of someone's argument. This is easy to do if we break things down a little. For example, take a listen to Piers here. It was also, I think, quite a disturbing piece that BuzzFeed did. And it talked about the negative impact of young impressionable male minds when they've read or seen some of the more inflammatory things you've said. What is the premise of Piers' argument? It's that Andrew is dangerous because of his impact on impressionable young minds. Now listen to what Piers says immediately after that. They quoted, for example, Sandy, 22, from Washington. My father's gone from a man who minored in women's studies in college, who was kind and in touch with his emotions, treated all people, men and women around him with kindness, to a man who says that whenever he sees an effeminate male stranger, he gets an overwhelming urge to murder them. Did you catch the gap in the argument? Did you say that my father went? She said, my father has gone. Her father. That's a full-grown man, firstly. So we're talking about my impact on children. You just talked about full-grown man here. Now so far, we've discussed how to engage with someone who's being combative. But sometimes an argument goes into an area you're not comfortable with and you don't want to engage with them at all. When that happens, you have every right to draw a conversational boundary. For example, watch Piers try to get Andrew to share about his personal life. Have you ever been in love? Yeah. How many times? Plenty. I believe in love between men and women. A real love, you know. How many times would you say? Enough. Andrew tries to move on, but Piers circles back a few seconds later. How many women have you loved? I don't know, Piers. A few. Give me a bullpup. 5, 10, 20? Let's say... You don't forget how many people you've been in love with. It's a strange line of questioning and Piers just will not give it up. So finally, listen to Andrew draw a boundary. I believe in family. I believe in children. I believe in... If you believe in family and children and love, why are you single? I'm not single. Well, you're not married. Well, if I was married, the last thing I would do is advertise it to the feral psychopaths on the internet. Most people aren't comfortable being that direct so they try to change the topic indirectly. It's much more effective to simply draw a boundary and let someone know that a topic is off-limits. That doesn't mean you have to shout or get confrontational. It can be as simple as saying, I'm not comfortable talking about that. So now you know how to see and avoid some common conversational traps when things get heated. But how do you turn things around and get back to a friendly positive conversation? One way is to purposely acknowledge any common ground. For example, there was a moment in the conversation when Andrew is talking about getting de-platformed from social media and he starts to lose his cool. Listen to how Piers gets him out of fight mode by establishing common ground. When they attacked me, they lump a whole bunch of things in together. They say misogynistic, racist, transphobic. They just put them all together at random. I mixed race. I don't know where they get these. They just get these buzzwords and put them in a sentence. By the way, I completely agree. It's crazy. And I've had the same thing done to me. Okay. And I'm not calling you anything. I'm asking you what you personally believe you are. The important thing here is that you are genuine and that comes not just in your words, but in your tone of voice. Listen to Piers here for a good example. A lot of what you say, I agree with. Yeah. Right? I do. Genuinely. I've read a lot of stuff you said. A lot of the stuff you talk about, I think it's got a good point, right? Some of you agree about a lot of things. But when I read that kind of thing, I'm like, I just... How much of that is you? How much of that is some act? Do you regret saying stuff like this? Now, our final advice today is actually something you won't see in the conversation with Piers and Andrew. And its absence is one of the biggest reasons that the conversation was so combative and so unproductive. Give yourself permission to change your mind. This is something Andrew seems to view as a bad thing. You can hear him talk about it here. That's why I've repeatedly asked you about that line to see if you've changed your position. But the reality is you haven't. It's not about changing positions. I'm a full-grown adult and I stick by the things I say and I'm responsible for them. If you view changing your mind as a bad thing, a sign of weakness, or being a flip-flopper, then, of course, you'll never change your mind. Or even when you do, you'll do what Andrew does and try to make all the things you've said in the past fit your new beliefs. For building fame online, maybe that's what's required. Andrew is certainly world-class at getting famous. But in your own life, give yourself the gift of permission to change your opinion. To say that you don't agree with everything your past self thought. That freedom will allow you to be happier and to grow. Now, publicly changing your mind is much easier said than done. It takes confidence to change your opinion in front of other people. If confidence is something you struggle with, you may like our course Charisma University. It's a step-by-step 30-day video series that comes with a daily action guide to show you exactly what to do each day to take your charisma and confidence to the next level. And if for whatever reason you don't, then you can get a full refund just by pushing a button inside the course. Thousands of people have gone through Charisma University so far and had great results. Here's what just a few of them have said. My biggest breakthrough has been gaining more confidence. If you knew me a year ago, you'd see a socially awkward guy. But that same guy had hidden confidence and charisma that has now been unleashed. If you're reading this or listening right now, think about who you want to be in a year. This course will teach you how to be that person. I had confidence in some areas but not in others. Then Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. I never expected such remarkable outcomes from a simple online routine. This course completely changed my mindset on how to approach people and think about myself. It has undoubtedly made a significant impact on my life.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Bill Burr is one of the most popular comedians alive today, despite having said about a hundred things that would get anyone else canceled. No means no, that's another one. No means no. It's like, no, it doesn't. All right? Look, look, no means no. No, that means no. All right, but no, stop it. What are you doing? Oh my God! Today, we'll go over how Bill manages to say these controversial things without hurting his relationships or popularity. Learning just a few of these habits will let you go into any conversation with confidence, knowing you can share your opinion without losing people's respect. Also, one quick note, this video is about psychology, not any particular belief. So, if you strongly disagree with anything Bill says in these upcoming clips, then they've been picked well. The first and most obvious thing Bill does is make people laugh. If you can get someone to laugh, they're more likely to be okay with what you said, even if one said differently, they would hate it. But how does he get you to laugh while he's saying something you might otherwise disagree with? Here's an example where Bill shares a potentially unpopular opinion. An NFL player hitting his wife would never make him stop watching football. I was talking to my buddy the other day like what they would have to do to get me to stop watching. Because you love football, you watch football. The commissioner could literally punt a baby across his office with his wingtips on. I'm still gonna watch on Sunday. Bill has a lot of different ways to make people laugh, but one of the easiest is to create a ridiculous mental image, something that catches you off guard and is specific. Here he shares another potentially controversial opinion. He thinks divorce payouts are unfair to the higher earner. Are you with your girlfriend living in LA? Yes, I am. I'm technically married, but I'm married how like I want to be married. Yeah. Which is I don't sign that behind-the-music contract where, you know, everything works out until it doesn't work out. I love how when you get a divorce, all of a sudden it costs like 50 grand a month to give a kid Froot Loops. Note that specificity. You want to drill down from breakfast to cereal to Froot Loops, just like he did before with shoes to dress shoes to wingtips. This is a pattern you'll see throughout the video. Here's one more quick example. You can see Conan lose it right when Bill paints a specific over-the-top mental image. For context, Bill is explaining why he thinks it's absurd that most people felt sympathy for Charlize Theron's serial killer in Monster. She was a serial killer. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like when you saw the Jeffrey Dahmer movie, it wasn't like, ah, somebody shoved a tuna fish sandwich up my ass and I confused people with food. So I like didn't make like a big excuse for him. You know, she was a psycho killing people and she should have died. Even when they're murdering people, it's somehow our fault. It's unreal. Why would having a tuna fish sandwich shoved up your butt make you want to eat people? Conan might have pushed back on a genuinely presented argument about society's views of male and female serial killers, but instead he's dying laughing at the absurd specificity of a tuna sandwich in the ass triggering cannibalism. You can use this trick anytime you want to make someone laugh. The second thing you'll notice Bill does when he's about to cross the PC line is begin by validating the other side. This is called pacing their reality. You partially affirm what they believe before going into your own controversial take. For example, here's a bit Bill does about domestic abuse. Before he says anything spicy, he makes it clear. It's obviously bad for a man to hit a woman. How do you not know not to do that shit? Do they really have to keep talking about it? Who is like wife beaters watching for? Oh, now I get it. It's only after he's made it clear that he agrees domestic abuse is bad that he goes into his potentially controversial opinion. So at the end of the hour, they come to the logical conclusion. They're like, there is no reason to hit a woman. There is no reason to hit a woman. And I was just like, really? I could give you like 17 right off the top of my head. No reason. How about this? You marry a girl, you fall in love, you buy her house, you go to work every day paying off the house, you come home one day, she's banging the next door neighbor, hand you divorce papers, you got to move out, sleep on a futon and still pay for that house that she's going to stay in. No reason. I'm not saying you should do it, but there's plenty of fucking reasons in that arc of a story. After sharing his unpopular opinion that it doesn't justify it, but there are reasons it happened, he circles back and addresses the most likely objection to his view, then extends an olive branch to meet on common ground. Look, I realize I'm coming off pretty ignorant right about now. I realize that. Let me extend an olive branch then, okay? I realize that there's some animal guys out there, okay? Horrible guys, you know, have a rough day at the factory, come home, tuna casserole, and just start swinging, alright? I realize they exist, they should be buried underneath the prison, okay? So if I can admit that, ladies, can you at least admit that every ass-kicking doesn't just fall out of the fucking sky? So to recap, validate the other side where you can, voice your own unpopular opinion, address the most common objection, and then try to end on common ground. This will allow people to agree with your unpopular opinion without feeling like they need to change any of their high-level values. Now, that was all done during a stand-up comedy special, but in the flow of a back-and-forth conversation, you don't have to do all four at once. You can start with just the first two steps and let the other person raise their objections before you try to meet on common ground. For example, here's Bill discussing the Me Too catchphrase, Believe Women, with Conan. It's like that Believe Women, it's like all of them? How about 85%? I'll give you 87%, alright? Again, he starts by validating the other side. Yes, most women should be believed. Then he gives his non-PC take that all is going too far. Is that last 13% that keys your car, lights your shit on fire, and puts a family pet in a pot of stew? Who put a pet in a pot of stew? Glenn Close. The fear most people have in sharing an unpopular opinion is that it will make people like them less. This is because people often interpret an opinion that's the opposite of one they hold as a direct attack on their beliefs and therefore their identity. Bill has two easy habits you can steal and soften that feeling of being attacked. The first is acknowledge you're not an expert. Bill's a stand-up comedian and so when he goes on these talk shows, it's often with a bit that he's thought through quite a lot. But he makes it clear he's not an expert and he could be wrong. We're all going to get replaced by like robots. That's what I think like eventually. You think we're all going to be replaced by robots? Yeah, according to my YouTube and Wikipedia research. I'm not going to sit here with no medical degree listening to you with no medical degree with an American flag behind you smoking a cigar acting like we know what's up better than the CDC. No, I'm just saying that I was on, you know, the internet and I was reading that a lot of the money just goes into their pockets. So I was like, all right, I want to agree with that and say that that's true and then repeat it on a talk show. People often mirror each other in conversation. So if you acknowledge you're not an expert, it's much easier for the people around you to do the same. The second thing you can do is verbalize if you see the other person getting uncomfortable. It shows you're socially aware and tuned into their reaction. For example, here's a clip where Bill is describing a lesbian he saw. Like the hard hat and like that surveyor thing. You feel it now? They're getting like all like they're backing off. Is he saying there's something wrong? I'm saying no, she was dressed ridiculous. The woman who happened to be a lesbian, it was funny the way she was dressed. I'm going to be washed up in six months. Here's another with Conan. You can see things are a little bit uncomfortable, but after he calls it out, it releases the tension and gets a big laugh. Always working on me like my wife is some completed work. You know, it's just like when's the light going to shine on you? Uh-huh. This crowd has hated me for three minutes. You probably noticed Bill often pairs this with some type of self-deprecating humor, but he does this well because he's a comedian and his goal is to make people laugh. In your own life, you can go that route, or you can simply say something like, hey, I can tell this is starting to be uncomfortable for you. That wasn't my intent. Do you want to just move on to another topic? Whether they do or don't, it will help your relationship and help the conversation go well if they see you prioritize the relationship over making your point. It shows your goal is to discuss an idea, not fight a person. This ties directly into a mindset Bill has. He's willing to back off an opinion. Watch him talk with Conan about the Joe Biden photo controversy. He gets the classic Bill Burr anger at first, but by the end, he makes it clear this isn't actually an opinion he's going to fight you over. He just looks like he's posing and people are like, oh, what is he doing? Yeah. Why is his hand there? Did he just sniffer? It's like, how f***ing bored are you? This is why nobody of any, like, any reasonable, decent human being is going to run for president. It's the millennials. The millennials? You're a bunch of rats. All you're doing is trying to get people in trouble. So it's the millennials that are making it impossible for anyone to run for president right now. I don't know what it is. Like, I don't have a problem. You just said that's what it was. Look, that was a long time ago. This can be hard to do while talking about triggering topics, but if you can keep it in mind, it will be fantastic for your happiness and the quality of your relationships. Now, one thing we were going to touch on today was Bill's hilarious use of anger. After all, Rolling Stone did dub him the king of rage comedy, but Bill seems to think his anger is more of a curse than a blessing. That was brutal. I don't want to be this guy, you know? I'm halfway through my life at this age, you know, and I've been an angry son of a b***h, and I got to turn this around, man. I'm embarrassed with my be— I don't want to be that guy! You die as the angry guy? That's the worst dude to die as. You got all of this s*** that you're sitting on, so you're sitting on all that and you haven't addressed it, so then it just— the only way for the steam to come out is like for you to snap or whatever, which is really not fair to the people around you. That last part is true of carrying around repressed anger, sadness, or anxiety. It hurts your relationships with other people and your ability to be happy and to achieve your full potential. If that resonates with you and you want to learn how to release your anger, sadness, or anxiety, you might be interested in our course, Emotional Mastery. It's a five-week program that is designed to help you master your emotions so that you consistently feel better than you might think is currently possible. This increased joy also naturally bleeds over into feeling more confident, so you can put an end to those moments where you feel controlled by fear of rejection, failure, or conflict.

This means exercises that get you in touch with feelings you may have been repressing for a long time, so you can raise the baseline level of joy that you feel on a day-to-day basis.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"And he gets rid of the microphone. What?! This is fantastic. Okay, great. Yeah. I'm having vicarious embarrassment. So we've all had moments in our life where we have been more awkward than we would like to be. We've probably all had moments where we've surprised ourselves with how charming, charismatic, and confident we can be. The question is, how do we go from one to the other on command? And I think that Elon Musk is a person who exemplifies the best of both worlds because there are times that I've seen him be incredibly stuttering, stumbling, and awkward in his presentations. I'm just incredibly impressed with the caliber of talent at Neuralink. But there's other times where he is genuinely charming. There's the fast way and the slow way. Okay. Give me the fast way. The fast way is drop thermonuclear weapons over the poles. You're a super villain! I want to dive into some clips of him and discuss what you can learn about how to take those moments where you're awkward and turn them into ones where you're actually charming and charismatic. So I think it's useful to start with the moments in which Elon is a little bit more awkward to find out what he might do differently. And one of the most famous is his infamous podcast with Joe Rogan. So let's take a look. What keeps you up at night? Well, it's quite hard to run companies. Yeah. Especially car companies, I would say. It's quite challenging. The car business is the hardest one of all the things you do? Yes. So I remember watching this before. This is very difficult to get an engaging answer out of him, and it reminds me of the video that we did with Kanye West on Jimmy Kimmel. Is that, for you, more rewarding than hearing people say they like your music? Both. It's both are. But let's continue here. So obviously, the first thing you see is a lack of enthusiasm and a very literal answering of the questions that Joe is asking him. In order for conversation to flow a little bit more comfortably, you want to go beyond the question that someone is asking you, add statements that don't directly answer what they're saying, but give them a few more threads to pull from. But let's see where this goes. Same with Tesla. We barely survived. How close did you get to folding? Very close. 2008 is not a good time to be a car company. So what you see here is an incredible lack of eye contact from Elon. So he's looking down in a way. I'm not exactly sure what's going on, and one of the things that I think happens later in this interview is he lights up a blunt, relaxes quite a bit. This is why people drink when they go to bars. I mean, it's legal, right? Totally legal. Okay. But, yeah, you obviously want to try to make a little bit more consistent eye contact when you're communicating with people, and give some energy. He's not doing either of those things here. So what do you do when everything goes wrong? Here's the Cybertruck, the glass that can't break. Armor class. Oh, my God. Well, maybe that was a little too hard. See, that's actually a fantastic initial save right there. It didn't go through. So that's a plus side. This is actually – I haven't watched the whole clip. He's not doing bad. Sir. Oh, man. It didn't go through. All right. Eh, not bad. This is actually really good. The only thing that I would have potentially critiqued here is his body language. I mean, walking around on stage with crossed arms is a big no-no. So what you want to do is when there's something embarrassing that happens, if you behave as if this is something that you need to speed through, that the audience can't linger on, that they can't laugh at, it signals to the audience that you are very, very uncomfortable with what just happened, that it has profound impact on not just the quality of the car, but the quality of you as a human being. But when you can stand up there in the heat, no matter, you know, if you stumble over something as you're speaking or a slide gets screwed up and you can't quickly get back on track, actually something that you can do is exactly what he did, which is crack an understated joke. Be like, well, this could be going better than it is right now. And the audience will immediately come to your side. You're inviting them in to acknowledge the uncomfortableness of that moment, to let out a laugh, and quite frankly, I'm impressed by how well he handled that right there. Oh, I've seen this on YouTube. Apparently they don't like each other very much. What are you supposed to say? Just things about AI, perhaps? Yeah. Okay. Let's see. The fidgeting. Fidgeting is tough. Okay, great. AI. Yeah. Oh, man. I'm having vicarious embarrassment as he sort of stumbles here. Actually, I'm told that does AI mean love? There's like a name, AI. It sort of sounds a bit like love. Yeah, AI. I hate the word AI called Artificial Intelligence. I call it Alibaba Intelligence. Yeah. Might end up being true. You never know. I think generally, people... The problem that you see here is that he can't just sit with not knowing what's going on, which is, granted, very difficult when you're in front of a group of people. A lot of fidgeting, a lot of moving the feet, the hands, stopping and starting his sentences. He'd be better off with a bit of silence and a bit of just building some sort of rapport and banter between him and Jack Ma. So let's see how he gets through it. The capability of AI. They sort of think like it's a smart human, but it's going to be much more than that. It'll be much smarter than the smartest human. Okay, and he's in. As I'm watching some of these clips with Elon, it's a very, very common thing that I've experienced in my own life. It seems that he needs time to get warmed up and started and feel comfortable in a new situation. It doesn't necessarily need to be with a new individual just sitting on this couch in front of this audience talking about this topic. He tends to pick up steam as he goes. Now, this is true of a lot of us, right? The first time that you go out to a networking event or when you're early in the day of an office and you don't know a ton of people, those are the hardest moments to get going. So what is best if you find that you're struggling to get that steam going is to have a little bit of a pre-going to wherever you're going routine to get yourself amped up. And what I find is that as you're getting dressed wherever you're going, play music that excites you. Move around as you're doing it. On the ride over, right? Play loud music. You can bang the steering wheel. If you're in an Uber, start talking to that driver. Get in the habit of warming yourself up so that when you arrive at that place, and if it's an interview, I've talked about this, you want to start talking to the secretary, to the other applicants, so that when you sit in that seat, you're not going in cold from a social perspective. You're going in warmed up. You're comfortable conversing with that person. You have some stuff to say. You can build rapport. And you don't feel like you just need to, for the first time all day, start croaking something out of your dead voice box. What is he doing with his lips? This is good stuff right here. This is fire. And he gets rid of the microphone? What? This is fantastic. Perfect, perfect. Dancing. Dancing is obviously something that you can be good at. You can be not so good at it. If you're doing it in a public venue of any kind, I will say 80% of the reception that you receive is based on your commitment. If you go up there and you are just trying to have fun, you can know that you have no rhythm, no moves, and quite frankly, I don't know that I've ever seen anyone with less of a repertoire than Elon has here. But it's awesome and especially where you see him commit the most is where it gets good, where he sells it. He takes his jacket off, does the fling thing. The more commitment that you have in these sorts of scenarios, and again, this is something we've covered, Jack Black knocks us out of the park plus he's actually got fantastic singing and dance moves. So I don't really have the moves. No, you do. But I thought I'd make up for it with just like commitment. Yeah. This is so, so, so huge for any sort of situation where you need to dance or participate. If you find that you're in some sort of team building exercise and you've got to stand up in front of a group and pretend to be a character, what will make people like you, enjoy that, whether it's dancing or anything else, is the level of commitment that you put in. Thank you for coming. And I want to know, what is the one thing that has surprised you about your life? Oh, one thing. Wow. Well, I certainly, I'm surprised about the whole thing, honestly. I certainly didn't expect to be, to be, for any of these things to happen, honestly. Yeah. I just, you know, I knew I wanted to be involved in technology. And in fact, the only reason I started a company back in 95, an internet company, was because I couldn't get it. There were only a few internet companies and I couldn't get a job at any of them. I tried to get a job at Netscape and sent my resume in and tried hanging out in the lobby, but I was too shy to talk to anyone. And then I was like, okay, well, I guess I'll have to start a company because I can't get it. Wow. That's crazy. That's crazy. And I mean, I don't even know what to make of that. I guess that's a really good thing that he didn't have the guts to go up and speak to anybody. But I do think what that illustrates is that he sounds like he's come a long way. Quite frankly, if you're going from not being able to speak to an individual with no eyes on you, to speaking in front of an entire room full of people, sometimes with thousands of people, millions of people on the internet, public facing constantly, that's a huge, huge leap. So kudos to him for doing it. And it does seem like he has built dynamism into his ability to be outgoing and charismatic, but what he hasn't built in is consistency. So if you're finding that that is something that you are struggling with as well, you might be interested in checking out our course, Charisma University. Charisma University is a 30-day course. It's actually the best thing that I think that I've ever made in terms of learning charisma and turning it from just theory that you know and maybe you watch on the channel and you enjoy it to something that you live and practice starting with habits that are thinking but then moving into completely second nature. That's the whole point of it and it's built around action guides. These are little things that you do every day of those 30 days. Start to establish habits of everything from how do you introduce yourself, how do you answer common questions like where are you from and what do you do for a living, all the way moving through conversation into body language, talking about speeches, and, of course, even ending with something like leadership which is very important when you're someone like Elon Musk and hopefully becomes important in your own life. So if you want to check that course out, I highly recommend it. We've got over 5,000 students that have stayed in the course and they have the opportunity like you will to get your money back if it's not for you. And every one of those 5,000 people has decided to stay. So that is the group size of people that think that Charisma University is well worth the investment and it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee for any reason at all. So if you go through the course and you find that for whatever reason you're not into it, you just drop us a line and you can get all of your money back. And we do that because, quite frankly, if it's not worth it to you, then I don't think you should have to take it. I hate those types of courses and all those businesses that run off of grabbing your credit card information and then never letting go. That's not what we do. So if you think you want to check that out and you think that you've got some growth, you could perhaps become more charismatic, more confident, or even just more consistent in the times that you are, I highly recommend checking out Charisma University. Either way, I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one. Peace.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 708}}\n",

Hey. How's it going? Good, how are you? Good. What's your name? Emily. I'm Josh. Hi. Very close. My first reaction is we're very close. Very strong eye contact. Okay, let's see how this develops. This is one... Okay, so I think this is one of those shows where they just make out with each other sight unseen. Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know. It's TLC. Can I kiss you? Sure. Okay, better. Better than the first one. So he gives her a peck on the cheek, walks away. She's a bit confused. Thought she signed up for something else. Is that all? Yeah, this is an awkward situation. They put you guys in some sort of a completely white room where you're expected to make out with a total stranger. Yeah, he's strong eye contact right off the bat. And there's, I don't even think any lips involved on his end. It's just a popping sound on her cheek. So what could he have done there? I mean, he's on the show. He's invited to kiss. I feel like kissing is a little bit tricky, but so what? This is so strange. You're not supposed to kiss. You're not supposed to kiss in the show. You're not supposed to kiss? No, you're supposed to. You're supposed to make out. I think you're supposed to make out. So presuming this is the TV show where two people are supposed to make out without speaking to one another, if you are going to go in for a kiss, the closeness is fine at that point. You can maintain eye contact. And the old Will Smith hitch adage of go 90% of the way and then wait is still tried and true. So guy doesn't understand his kid. Why are these all dating? Yeah. He's hanging in there. What is she doing? Get out. Where's my camera on? Oh, man, he's not done. What is she doing? Why? All right, let's try to let's try to learn something. Come on, not the best, not the best line. You don't want to try convincing someone to kiss you. As soon as you enter into the realm of convincing, you want to go home alone. He's got to stop. She's got to get out of there. I don't know. She's like trapped against this wall. She's got a camera to her left. I don't even know what to say. Don't do this. This one I've seen. This one I always. Yes. It turned into a high five and it just fell apart. It was. I never want to do that again. OK, so this one, this one. God, this happened to me the other day. I feel like this is so much more common and people feel really bad about this kind of stuff. He's got outside hand inside. That's a tricky handshake. It turned into a high five and it just fell apart. It was. I never want to do that again. So quite frankly, I think Felix here didn't do anything horrible. Conan is his job is to make jokes. But OK, so you botched the handshake. I've done this millions of times. I'm sure you guys have as well. You call it out. You laugh at it and you do it again. Now, Conan has a TV show. He's trying to get as many laughs in as he can. So he makes a huger thing out of it and says, I never want to do that again. But quite frankly, if you do this, just say, oh, my God, that was the most awkward handshake I've ever had. And then go in for another one. Give him a hug. Do whatever it takes. Guy doesn't. Oh, it doesn't. What knowledge or awareness did you have of him growing up? Or when did you learn? Well, obviously, growing up, you he's one of the most known athletes in. I'm packing any kind of sport that he did and that I, you know, even playing hockey. Everyone knows him, right? God darn. If there is something to say here, there's so much less shame in saying I don't know than in pretending to know something that you don't. There's going to be so many times in life where people ask you a question where you're expected or people you feel like you're expected to have the answer. And what you can do in this situation to say this is embarrassing. So one of the things I talk about is lowering the filter, saying how you actually feel in these kinds of situations where you feel stuck. So when you're head, you know, you're going through Nelson Mandela, Nelson Mandela, did he play? Is he a linebacker? What did he do? You just go, this is really awkward and embarrassing, but I'm actually not sure who is Nelson Mandela. And then, right, that is uncomfortable, but gosh, not as bad as this, whatever sport he may have played. It's a good time to say that this video has been sponsored by Simple Habit. They are an app that I use and they have a lot of different meditations that you can access every single day to build joy, gratitude, and in this case, I actually have one that I created on confidence in social situations.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Sam Harris has been one of the world's most formidable debaters for nearly 20 years. He has gone toe-to-toe with other people we've covered on the channel like Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson and he has held his own and although he doesn't quite have that biting wit of Christopher Hitchens, he manages a few zingers of his own as well. You're not a physicist and basically, every sentence demonstrates that — that you speak on the subject. Now, so in this video, we are going to break down five reasons Sam Harris is so excellent in his debates. You will discover how you can use these tactics to your advantage as well as the betterment of all those who encounter your masterful skills. Now, believe it or not, there's only one point I'm covering that deals with the formal rules of logic but it's enough to provide an effective way to dismantle many, many arguments and it looks like this. First, you identify the premise that someone is putting forward. When I'm looking at you right now, you may assume that what I see is a material but that's not what I see and it's not what I believe. And I think there's something in you that is more than you believe. Rather than arguing with that premise or disproving it directly, accept what the other person said as true. Then, apply their logic to even more extreme situations knowing that eventually, they won't like where their own logic has taken them. This is constrained by our common sense in every other domain of discourse. I mean, just take, for example, the people who think Elvis is still alive. Okay, what's wrong with this claim? The technical term for this is reductio ad absurdum — reduction to absurdity and it is an incredible technique because your counterparts are essentially dismantling their own arguments. Rather than fighting, you show how a statement that someone else has made leads to more ridiculous outcomes that are obviously not true. So your opponent essentially destroys their own logic by disagreeing with its conclusions. Now, this can actually be difficult to use when someone's premises aren't clear and that's often the case in conversation. We don't speak in formal proofs. So Sam has learned to identify the implied or hidden premises in the statements of his counterparts. These hidden premises can be used to one's advantage in a debate and I discussed that in the Ben Shapiro breakdown which I highly recommend if you're interested in this topic. I'm going to link that below. But here is an example of a hidden premise that Sam identifies and dismantles with an argument that makes the logic sound absurd. First, see if you can spot that hidden premise. Ben, in this case, is arguing that religion and, in this case, Catholicism has been supportive of scientific inquiry. In fact, that it was one of the foremost champions of scientific inquiry. Virtually all major universities were sponsored by the Catholic Church which saw consonance between science and religion as a reason to actually investigate the natural world. Well, no, I mean, again, I think that's backwards. Did you catch it? Ben's logic looks something like this though he doesn't state it outright. Now, with this in mind, watch how Sam responds and immediately shows this line of argument can be taken to absurdity. I think the reality is there was no — I mean, everything that was good that was done anywhere at any time prior to, you know, pick your year was done by some religious person. I mean, there was just nobody else to do the job, right? So you could make the argument that, you know, Catholics built every bridge in Europe until the Protestants came around and they built their half of the bridges and so there was just no one else to do the job. So if you can find the hidden premise and then take it to an extreme, you already have a very powerful logical tool to completely destroy someone's argument. But as with all human endeavors, emotion drives debates just as much, if not more, than logic. So the rest of the points in this video are emotionally based. Even if they're coming from someone who seems Vulcan-like in their demeanor. The first of these is conciliatory statements where you acknowledge the validity or at least the seeming reasonableness of the opposing viewpoint. It looks something like this. Let me address that question because it seems — so this can all seem very abstract and academic and of no use to anyone. This next statement is one that Sam says blatantly during an exchange where Ben Affleck was upset about Sam's statements on Islam. Let me just give you what you want. There are hundreds of millions of Muslims who are nominal Muslims who don't take the faith seriously, who don't want to kill apostates, who are horrified by ISIS and we need to defend these people, prop them up, and let them reform their religion. But by that point, it was already eight minutes into this exchange and it was too late to cool anyone off. ISIS couldn't fill a double-A ballpark in Charleston, West Virginia and you're making a career out of it. No, no, no. The point that I am making here is that conciliatory statements are important before people get heated or dig into their positions. In fact, I think that the most important thing I'd like to see more of in public intellectuals is this — conciliatory statements. Now, of course, I'm recognizing it is very, very hard to do in the moment but it may have had a big impact, for instance, on the conversation between Jordan Peterson and Kathy Newman if each individual understands that they are not being attacked as a person. Now, we have an entire video breaking down that particular interaction and how to keep cool and avoid embarrassing yourself in arguments if you want to check that out. I will link to that video in the description. Now, another emotional but effective point is that Sam frequently cracks jokes. You would think this doesn't make sense in a debate but when it's done at the expense of the other side's arguments, this tactic can actually win over the audience like in this clip where Sam argues against the existence of a Judeo-Christian God. ...and he's got galaxy upon galaxy to attend to but he's especially concerned with what we do and he's especially concerned with what we do while naked. ...or when you make yourself the butt of a joke, it can open up the other side to listening to you more and maybe even to changing their mind. ...I've been very worried about this that all of you have given up a perfectly serviceable Tuesday evening only to hear the four of us tell you every which way that we have no idea what happens after that. ...I won't go deep into the details here but different types of jokes can have wildly different effects. I've covered this at length in other videos and, again, I'm going to link to those below. For now, know that in a debate setting, a well-timed joke can either open your counterpart to having their mind changed or simply win audience points which brings me to the most persuasive element, I think, of Sam's style of speech and it's his use of vivid specific imagery. Visual images are incredibly persuasive in people because we see them in our head, we can't deny it, it becomes true which is why even though Sam could have simply said this... Just to give some context, we're living in a world in which 9 million children every year die before they reach the age of 5. ...he decided to add this. That is an Asian-style tsunami of the sort you remember from 2004 every 10 days killing only children before the age of 5. It's why in this next clip, Sam simply could have said that the conditions at Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturer of Apple products, are really unfair but instead, he says the following and, again, the point that he makes here is very upsetting but I say it and show it here to illustrate its power. Perhaps on the iPad itself that the people who built this gorgeous device live lives of such unendurable drudgery that they regularly hurl themselves off the rooftops at the factory where they work. Nets have been installed to catch their falling bodies. The real power comes when you have conditioned these ideas to the degree to which they become a habit. It's no longer a tactic but a style of behaving and you know that's true when you start using them one on top of the other which is where they become extremely powerful. So watch as Sam follows that particular point up with a reductio ad absurdum on the benevolence of God's will plus a joke and that just goes to show how all of these combined can be used to great effect. It's God's will that I'm so lucky. If God had wanted me to do dangerous and deadly boring work for a few dollars a day, that's what I would be doing but as it happens, he wants me to have a new iPad. Hallelujah. There you have it — five, not all, but five of the reasons that Sam Harris is so dominant in debates. Now, I've made a playlist of all the videos that I mentioned before. I think you will find them very useful because they contain some of the tactics that Sam is both using and arguing against, not to mention some of his top debate partners including Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson. I'm going to link to that playlist with the videos right here on screen as well. Now, if you want to make sure that you get more videos like this, of course, subscribe but a special one today because Game of Thrones is coming back and that means the breakdowns that we have done will finally, after many years, be making a comeback as well. I'm very much looking forward to them. Hit the notification bell if you want to make sure not to miss them. Either way, I hope that you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 536}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, you'll learn 5 steps that will help you connect with and then impress anyone, no matter how unreachable they may seem. We'll do this by breaking down some tricks used by MrBeast, Tim Ferriss, and Yes Theory to connect with people like Will Smith, Justin Trudeau, Elon Musk, and more. To start, you need to get on the person's radar. The easiest way to do this is to find a low-traffic connection — a less in-demand person who knows the person you're trying to meet. Because they have fewer people asking for their time, they'll be more open to talking with you. For a concrete example, let's look at Tim Ferriss. He attributes his success, in large part, to the connections he made at South by Southwest. Listen to his strategy. When a panel ended, instead of flooding the scene to get in line to talk to a panelist, I would actually talk to the moderator, who people tend to ignore. This is a great strategy for networking events and conferences, but it's also something you can do when trying cold outreach to someone specific. For instance, because most people think of Charlie as the face of Charisma on Command, he receives hundreds of emails a day, which means most have to go unread. But for years, if he emailed me, it was almost guaranteed that I would see it, and I could then forward it along to Charlie if I thought he'd want to see it too. I probably just ruined my inbox by sharing this, so now you'll need a new low-traffic connection for Charlie, but the principle still stands. It's important to note here, a low-traffic connection won't automatically introduce you just because you ask. So how do you get someone to want to make a connection for you? There are two ways to do this, and if you do either well enough, you can even skip step one. The first way is to be a beacon. Do cool sh** people want to be a part of. For instance, Will Smith accepted Yes Theory's challenge to Helladive because he knew it would get their channel more attention. I love what you guys are doing and I want to support that as much as possible. This is one great way to be a beacon. Have a project that helps people outside of yourself. This is how the Buried Life guys were able to play basketball with Obama when he was one of the most in-demand people on the planet. It's also how Mr. Beast caught Elon Musk's attention. Elon liked Jimmy's mission to protect the environment. When we did Team Trees, our goal was $20 million and we hit $6 million in the first few days and it started to slow down. And then out of nowhere, Elon Musk just replied to one of my tweets and he's just like, oh, this looks interesting. And then Elon just donated a million dollars and then all of a sudden now the world cares and it's like paying attention. It may seem like being a beacon requires a huge audience, but that's not the case at all. Sometimes, being a beacon can just mean being the most fun-looking person in the room. When Yes Theory wanted to meet Justin Trudeau, their plan centered mostly around getting his staff's attention by wearing bright, fun Christmas sweaters to an event. If you stick around the place long enough and look ridiculous, people just come up to you. You don't even have to do anything. You've been dubbed the sweater guy. Oh, I so regret not wearing my awesome sweater. If being a beacon seems daunting, there's another fast, simple way you can connect with anyone you admire. Lead with value. This seems obvious, but almost everyone does this wrong. The most common mistake people make is trying to mask a value take as a value give. The quintessential one is, I'd love to buy you a cup of coffee and pick your brain. That's not leading with value. $5 for an hour of someone's time is a bad deal. One red flag to the other person that you're not really leading with value is how often they hear you say, I. For example, in this next clip, a Logan Paul fan snuck into an event to try to get a job and Logan actually gives him a chance to pitch himself. Watch this as an example of what not to do. No, I just need to talk to you. I'm trying to talk about business, trying to talk about trying to get a job. I want to do media. What are you good at? I was having dances. I did like that. I did that video, you know, like, oh, yeah, you know, you really got what it takes. I don't. I don't. I need a man. Why would I do that? Totally fair question by Logan. And in response, the guy continues to talk and I and he makes another common mistake. Listen to this next clip and see if you can spot it. You know, life isn't about handouts. You know what I'm saying? I know. I'm not trying to get a handout. I'm trying to work hard for a little money. No money. I don't know. I can get a job somewhere else. All I want to move to LA. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not trying to get a handout. I'm not trying to get. What are you trying to do? I'm trying to work hard for a little money. No money. I don't know. I can get a job somewhere else. All I want to move to LA and I want to, I want to be able to be part of that. Look, I have to go. This may seem counterintuitive, but most successful people aren't interested in undefined free work. So if you want to work with someone you admire, get specific on how you can help them. A good framework to use is I have such and such past experience, which will let me do X for you, where X is something that you know from researching them that they actually value. If you're meeting people at an event, a great line to instantly find out what people value is. So what were you hoping to get out of this event? Starting like this feels organic and clues you in on how you can help them. Do this and you'll be amazed at how many great relationships you make. The absolute best way to lead with value is to give value without asking for anything in return. A good example of this was Mr. Beast with PewDiePie. I spent all my money on ads so he can remain the number one most subscribed to channel in the world. It's the day of the Superbowl and these are our blankets and if for some reason they confiscate the blankets, we're wearing sub to PewDiePie shirts. We will advertise PewDiePie to a hundred million people today. Now most of us can't buy billboards or Superbowl tickets just to connect with someone. So here's a quick example from a friend of mine that anyone can copy. He heard on a podcast that a big YouTuber he admired was interested in reading a particular book but hadn't gotten around to it. So my friend bought the book in hard copy then went to their next live event, waited around after and gave it to them. It wasn't expensive but it showed thoughtfulness and initiative which got the YouTuber interested in at least talking more to my friend. They ended up giving him an internship and eventually a full-time job. Now if you want to make multiple people want to connect with you at the same time, you can combine being a beacon and leading with value by hosting events. MrBeast is a good example of someone who does this very well. This is the largest stadium in the world and inside are the 10 biggest creators on YouTube. This is $1 million and whichever one of them I find last keeps it. Imagine you're an influencer who gets that invite. You get to have fun, meet awesome people and potentially win a million dollars. Of course, you're going to say yes. This lets MrBeast invite and connect with whoever he wants and you can do this on a smaller scale by starting a club, fundraiser or meetup that people want to attend or speak at. Now, leading with value is important especially when you're trying to get the attention of someone whose attention is in high demand but it's equally important not to forget the human element. Connecting with someone you admire shouldn't be transactional so don't focus on connecting with people just because you think they can help you get famous or make you money. Don't be the person who emails Ben and Chris at Charisma on Demand. Aim for people you have a genuine interest in. So one quick tip for when you do connect — abandon first instinct questions. Make a list of the questions you think the person gets asked by most people then throw that list in the trash. The person you admire is bored of hearing the same questions over and over so ask something original — something they'll be excited to answer. Beyond that, the best thing you can do is stop hero worshiping. For someone who's rich or famous, it's easy to find people that look up to them. What's harder is finding someone who's comfortable around them and makes them laugh. At the end of the day, the person you want to connect with is just a person. So once you've followed the steps in this video and given yourself the best chance to reach them, let your personality shine through. Now if you want to be better at making amazing first impressions so that you can go into these conversations confident that if you do get a chance to talk with someone, they'll definitely want to see you again, you may like our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in just 30 days. Here are just a few of the things that past members have written us. The first comes from a guy who was promoted to a senior position early in his career. He says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you have taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. This next one comes from another person who started a new job. They say, I wanted to let you know that I nailed those first few days at work. Everything that I needed was right there at the moment I needed it. The confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset. With all your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it just could not go wrong. And this last one comes from an army officer. They say, I used to come off overly serious and reserved which got in the way of connecting with new people. Since taking the course, I have way more confidence to just go out and strike up a conversation with random people. It's also helped me handle body language and physical contact a lot smoother and in general, I notice people are smiling way more when I'm around. Thank you for making it. I'm glad I joined. If you do join CU, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all. We make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because we want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course. If you want to check the course out, click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this program and get a ton out of it and we'd love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 574}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Failure might delay your dreams, but fear will kill them, because fear leads to inaction. So in today's video, you'll learn seven tricks to help silence that voice in your head that fears rejection. That way, you can go into any conversation with confidence, knowing you'll feel completely unfazed if you do get rejected. Well, I don't think we should see each other anymore. Oh, that's okay. What? No, it's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else. The first step to becoming fearless in conversation is realizing that you are not your first impression. When you think, I got rejected, it makes you feel like you aren't good enough. That's why you're scared of rejection. So replace the thought, I got rejected, with something more accurate and more empowering, like that conversation didn't go well. Because someone can't possibly reject you. They can't see your soul. They don't know you to your core. Someone can only reject how you've presented yourself. And how you present yourself is a skill you can improve. As you gain more experience auditioning, you get better at it, and you start really to get feedback. The same idea applies to interviews, sales, dating apps, and approaching someone attractive. Auditions are all skills. You can learn to be incredibly good at any of them. So anytime you get rejected, simply think of it as feedback that there's a skill you need to improve. The second trick to stop fearing rejection is to realize that rejection is inevitable. Shame is optional. Everyone gets rejected, and often the most successful people in the world have failed more and been rejected more than anyone else. The auditioning process is basically a process of being rejected over and over and over and over again until you either give up or something breaks and you get an opportunity. When I raised money for Amazon, 40 people told me no, so I had to take 60 meetings to get 20 yeses. She asked me to be her prom date, and then the day before she told me she was only joking. And she went with Sebastian Lippiat instead. The next time you're feeling shame about being rejected, remind yourself that everyone you admire has been rejected at some point. Rejection doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Internalize that, and you'll stop fearing it. Not only is it normal, rejection often paves the road to success. It doesn't matter whether your goal is to find an amazing person to date, get your dream job or start a successful business, exceptional results often require multiple tries. So instead of avoiding rejection, recognize that life is a numbers game. Maximize your shots on goal. Do you know how many auditions the average working actor needs to go on typically before booking a job? One in 64 auditions. And I promised myself I wasn't going to get upset if I didn't book something before 64 auditions because that would be deluded thinking because the reality is that's the average. Here's the formula to living your dream life. Try. If you fail, reflect on why you failed. Improve. Try again. Your success is inevitable. If these mindset shifts aren't enough to get you to take action, there's a more concrete trick you can use. Amp up your carrot-stick motivation. If you aren't taking action on something, it means the reward you think you'll get by doing it doesn't outweigh the pain you imagine you'll feel if you fail. So to get yourself to take action, increase the cost of not trying. One way is the money method. Go to a friend you trust, give them $20, and tell them you only get it back if you do the thing that scares you. If that doesn't get you to take action, simply increase the amount of money. Eventually, you will take action just to get your money back. Once you do start trying, you'll experience something amazing. Rejections are good for you. Repeatedly risking rejection is one of the fastest ways to build extreme confidence. It's exposure therapy. You do what scares you over and over until it doesn't faze you. Navy SEAL David Goggins says this habit is the key to all of his success. That's the key thing. Through repetition of things you don't want to do, you develop mental, like, like an armor for your mind. Sometimes all it takes is one day of action to permanently level up your confidence. For example, the guy in this next video has never gone out on a date in his life. So he decides that to get over his fear of rejection, he's going to ask out 100 women in one day. Watch what happens. No. No. No. Realistically, no. I probably wouldn't. Now at this point, Sam started to lose what little confidence he had coming in. But his whole life, he'd always heard the phrase, eighth time's the charm. So he decided to give it one more try. Would you go on a date with me? Yeah. I mean, you seem very straightforward. Yes. I like how you approach me. Oh my God. Now, hold on, hold on, hold on. She may be laughing. It's not a no. Hmm. What about somewhere in UCSD? Would you say yes if I said somewhere in UCSD? Sure. Why not? Told you. There is power in speed running rejection. In a very short period of time, you can transform from someone who's paralyzed by fear to someone who's not paralyzed by fear. You can transform from someone who's paralyzed by fear to someone who's not paralyzed by fear. You can transform from someone who's not paralyzed by fear to someone who's not paralyzed by fear. There is power in speed running rejection. In a very short period of time, you can transform from someone who's paralyzed by fear into one of the most courageous people you know. Just make sure you do this in a way that's fun and lighthearted. Don't be rude or hostile. And if you live in a super small town or school, consider taking a trip somewhere before you try this just so you don't build a reputation. Asking people out isn't the only way to build your courage muscle. You can do cold calling or door-to-door sales, or you can try something like Noah Kagan's Starbucks challenge. Go to a different coffee shop each day and ask for your coffee for free. In Jordan Peterson's clinical experience, exercises like these are the fastest way to build courage. Get over your fear of rejection. And how do you do that? By encountering it continually and continually and continually so that you're no longer paralyzed. Once you've done everything in this video enough times, you'll find yourself a changed person. You'll have a ton of confidence and you'll have grown so much from reflecting on what didn't go well. At that point, the meaning of rejection shifts. Rejection becomes a sign that you aren't a good match. Once you've worked on yourself and your confidence and you're happy with who you are, it stops being about presentation. Now rejection is about fit. Rejection is actually sparing you from a future breakup or a firing. This mindset becomes way easier to have if you zoom out. If you obsess over getting one specific job or one specific person, you get desperate and you're going to be afraid of rejection. Instead, focus on becoming the type of person who has options. So if you get nervous during job interviews, focus on building the charisma skills to interview well and the work-related skills that you know will make you a great applicant. Then interviews become something you actually look forward to because you know you'll crush them. Or if dating makes you nervous, don't worry about getting one particular person to like you. Instead, focus on becoming someone that a lot of people would love to be with. And even beyond that, purposely create a life you really enjoy even when you aren't dating anyone. Suddenly, you won't care nearly as much if you get rejected because you don't feel like you need them in order to be happy. Life is a lot more fun when you have multiple options you're happy with. The fastest way I know of to build a life with options is to develop your charisma. Because achieving mastery in most skills can take years and even decades. But you can see massive improvement in your charisma in just a month or two. Most people simply never try to learn it or if they do, they aren't sure how to learn it effectively. If you want a specific blueprint for taking your charisma to the next level, check out our video course Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program that tells you exactly what to do every day so that 30 days from now you radiate confidence and charisma naturally without even thinking about it.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"People can be hostile with a fake friendly demeanor. It becomes tricky to know whether to confront them or just smile through it. And that's why in today's video, we are covering a four-step method that you can use to stand up to rude, passive-aggressive behavior without acting like a jerk. And we'll be using a tense Robert Downey Jr. interview that we covered in one of our first ever videos but we thought that an update with more concrete advice and visuals would be useful. So the first step in the method when someone is being rude is to non-verbally warn them to stop. You see Robert do that here when asked an uncomfortable question at a press junket. I'd really like to ask you about a quote you gave to the New York Times. And I don't want to pry so if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. But what you said to the New York Times once was it was after your incarceration. The reason we start with non-verbals is because they are subtle which is important. You don't want to jump down someone's throat when it's possible that you're misinterpreting their intent because that would just make you look needlessly defensive. When using non-verbals, there are three broad options and the first is what you just saw from Robert — non-verbal signals that ask, what are you doing? Note how Robert Downey Jr. uses his eyes to indicate that this line of questioning is confusing and displeasing to him. The second type says, I see what you're up to, stop. A steady but calm stare communicates this very effectively. And you see Russell Brand do it on MSNBC when the interviewers were treating him rudely. This had the desired effect. Based on just that body language, one interviewer changed her approach to Russell totally and was complimentary just seconds later. You look fantastic. That is a very kind compliment. You also look beautiful. The third type of non-verbal communication that acts as a deterrent for rude behavior is simply ignoring the person doing it. In this next clip, you see Russell's attention wander and it immediately makes the host feel like they need to be more kind in order to win him back. It's funny though because I travel a lot. These people are at work, are they? Yeah, they're working. They're just at work. I'm gonna ask a serious question. Can I try? I'll try. Try. It's never good. I'll try. Go ahead. Everyone asks, what do you like better — TV, movies, or stand-up? Which one's more difficult? Feel free to mix and match and use whichever style best suits your personality and the moment but know that the commonality with all of these non-verbal communications is that they act as negative reinforcement. It's not comfortable to talk to someone who's indicating confusion, opposition, or disinterest and for that reason, it's very likely that non-verbals will put an end to rudeness before it even becomes overt. Sometimes, though, non-verbals can be missed so a less subtle approach becomes necessary and that brings us to the second step — the indirect warning shot like this. The statement sort of stands by itself, doesn't it? I mean, does that mean you're not a liberal or that you came out of prison not being a liberal? Are we promoting a movie? Indirect warnings are impossible to miss but they allow that the other person is being oblivious instead of intentionally rude. The key here is not to attack the other person. Instead, speak without assuming any malicious intent. Questions like Robert Downey Jr.'s can work as do descriptions of behavior that you like and don't like which is what we see Russell do here in that same MSNBC interview. The thing I enjoy most is stand-up comedy because you're direct with your audience. You can't be misinterpreted, people can't get confused. You know what happens if you work in media? People like to change the information so that it suits a particular agenda. You see in these examples both negative and positive reinforcement and both can work in your own life. Phrases like, that's an odd question are subtle negative reinforcers while ones like, you know, I really appreciate when can positively reinforce different behaviors. Combine these to indirectly warn people to be more thoughtful while still allowing them to save face in the moment. Now, nearly all conflicts will be handled by this point but the rare exception will continue and necessitates the third step where subtlety goes out the window — the call-out. It looks like this. Well, I think we've got three more minutes on our agreement. Your foot's starting to jump a little bit. You better get to your next question. And I just wondered whether, you know, you think you're free of all of that or whether that's still something... I'm sorry. I really don't. What are we doing? Well, I'm just asking questions. That's all. When calling someone out, you do not want to lose your cool and blow up. It's counterintuitive but the more matter-of-fact you are, the more powerful the call-out is. A simple rule of thumb is to calmly describe the behavior that the other person is doing and then tell them that it's rude like Russell does here. I think it's not listening to him. It's experience. It's just sort of taking it all in. You are talking about me as if I'm not here and as if I'm an extraterrestrial. You know I'm from a country that's near to you. The moment of the call-out might seem like the pinnacle of confidence and social power but it's important not to skip right to it. It is always possible that you've misheard someone or misunderstood them which is why the nonverbal and indirect steps are so useful. Presuming that you followed all the steps up to the call-out, though, if you receive anything less than an apology, we get to the E — exit the situation. You need to be willing to remove yourself from all of those situations where people are treating you poorly otherwise, opportunists will treat you like a doormat. So separating yourself as calmly as possible ensures that you don't have people emotionally abusing you throughout your life. We see Downey do it right after going through the N, I, and C steps. Bye. Thank you, guys. Are you... I'm sorry. It's okay. Of course, you'd prefer the walkout to be a rare outcome which is why it's important to remember to invite de-escalation of the situation at every step. And Robert did this. He was smiling, offering other conversation topics and at least some answer to questions that he felt were inappropriate. Are we promoting a movie? To me, the thing is that I'm certainly not going to backpedal on anything I've said but I wouldn't say — actually, I wouldn't say I'm a Republican or a liberal or a Democrat. The overarching strategy is to warn someone less and less subtly while remaining open to a productive conversation. This sets up a powerful dynamic where things get uncomfortable if passive aggressiveness and rudeness are pursued but enjoyable if they're dropped. Now, everything that we've covered here gets much easier if you are confident in yourself and know that you don't need any individual to like you in order to achieve your goals. Now, this can be especially difficult when there's someone who you feel you can't risk upsetting. For instance, someone you're attracted to, a boss at the office, or a colleague that you need to work with all the time. The nice method still works in these situations but it needs to be accompanied by a mindset that gives you the guts to arrive at a call-out and an exit if necessary. And that mindset is that you do not need any particular individual — even your current boss. With skills, charisma, and time, you can always form new more positive relationships be they social or professional. So don't allow the fear of upsetting a particular individual stop you from demanding to be treated with respect. Instead, become a person who knows that they're better off starting over than settling for poor treatment. Beyond this conflict, though, charisma can be a huge accelerator at work. In fact, I think most people underrate its importance when it comes to promotions and raises. And if improving yours is something that you're interested in, you might be interested in our flagship course, Charisma University.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Keanu Reeves has become the Internet's crush whether he knows it or not. And now you've been dubbed the Internet's boyfriend. How do we feel about that? I've been what? Normally, on the channel, we cover extroverted celebrities who charm in larger obvious ways but what is amazing about Keanu, aside from the fact that he's 54 and looks 34, is that he is massively popular in spite of his reclusivity and more introverted nature. So in this video, we're going to explore why Keanu is so popular while you learn to exude incredible charisma as an introvert or even just someone who is quieter or a bit shy. First off, Keanu often directs and redirects praise towards others. When receiving awards, he spends a tremendous amount of time talking about the contributions of the people around him. I am not here without working with such talented artists and people. Erwin, without all of what you did for me, I would not be here. So thank you. I am forever grateful. One reporter even jokes about how bad Keanu is at taking compliments to which he immediately launches into spreading the praise again. You can't take a compliment, can you? It was cool. I mean, to work with Angelica Houston and Halle Berry, Mark Dacasco. Now, sometimes, there's no one around to redirect praise towards so when a question arises that implies some sort of admirable trait, Keanu tends to deflect with humor like in this case. What is your secret for always staying down to earth? Well, I mean, gravity. To be clear, there is no such thing as being too humble but sometimes, low self-esteem can mask itself as humility and that makes it impossible for someone to sit in pride at their accomplishments. As C.S. Lewis said, true humility is not thinking less of yourself. It is thinking of yourself less. The most charismatic thing to do if you'd rather not be in the limelight for praise isn't to duck compliments entirely or to clam up when you're in that position. Instead, give a heartfelt thank you, show the complimenter that you appreciate their words and then redirect towards others that helped. In that case, it's not about lowering yourself. Instead, it's about elevating others. The second thing that you'll likely notice about Keanu is his Zen-like presence. Like many introverts, he speaks in quiet calming tones. In Parabellum, part of the way that we've expanded is it's multiple people — more multiple people. Sometimes, this more calm type will find it hard to hold the attention of a high-energy group. The good news is that you can sometimes use this to your advantage without changing your style and you can do that by making the content of what you are saying mismatch that laid-back style and you do this for humorous effect so deliver a dramatic punchline in a really calm tone like this. What does that mean to do your action as opposed to your stunt? Okay, so I'll do some fight scenes and then John Wick will get hit by a car and that's Jackson Spiedel. This calm attitude isn't going to exude charisma on its own though. As we saw with Sophie Turner, moments of punctuated enthusiasm are often incredibly captivating when coming from a more laid-back introverted individual. A word or two in a louder tone can go a long way towards re-hooking an audience that isn't paying full attention. Watch how Keanu does it. Does that not make you nervous at all? No, it's a movie! But the horse... But perhaps Keanu's most effective tool for making his calm demeanor charismatic instead of wallflowery and one that you should definitely take are his enthusiastic hand motions. When he's interested in the topic he's speaking about, he gesticulates like crazy. He goes big, he goes small, and he sometimes rocks between the two. It might have been a fleeting passing something at a something in Sydney. Great to see you again. One particular motion that is a favorite of Keanu is this little hand rub and he does this before going into a story that gives the impression that whatever's coming next is going to be really juicy. It's a nice little trick to get people to listen to stories if you don't have that booming extroverted nature when you start. Now I have to say, technically, from a pure public speaking perspective, not everything that Keanu does is ideal. For instance, check out this clip where Keanu speaks without looking Steven in the eye. You know, I worked with a second-generation horse master, Ted Griffith, and his family and... Long periods of unsustained eye contact tend to break rapport when you're in conversation so I don't advise doing this purposely. But it was actually this clip that unlocked one of the most interesting things I saw in Keanu. As I look back over other interviews, I saw that he sometimes goes into longer stretches without looking the interviewer in the eye and when he does so, he usually looks down and to the right. Now I have to pause here to tell you a little bit about NLP. According to NLP, there are three primary modalities in which we represent the world in our own heads. There's visual, like when you see an image in your head, audio, hearing music, and kinesthetic, remembering the feel of the wind on your face, for instance. And people tend to prefer using one of these most of the time so when you're in a visual mode, you may talk faster — you're seeing pictures after all — communicate in imagery, and say things like, I see your point rather than I hear you or I feel you. When you're in an audio mode, you tend to think in words. You'll be more likely to engage in prolonged conversation and will be more sensitive to loud or jarring noises. But when you watch Keanu tell stories, it's clear that he is demonstrating the more rare third modality — kinesthetic. He's experiencing the story through how it felt more than how it looked or how it sounded. Now it also matches kinesthetic types in that he speaks more slowly, gesticulates often, and often, words don't quite communicate what he wants to say. ... Which brings us back to the last indicator of Keanu's type and the one that I mentioned first — his eyes. According to NLP, the area that your eyes dart to when you're thinking is indicative of the mode that you are currently in and down to the right is most commonly associated with — you guessed it — the kinesthetic modality. Now I bring all of this up for two main reasons. First off, because a high-level communicator can identify the style of the people around them and adjust their own to match that preferred style. So paying attention to indicators is critical and if you're interested, we can cover it in depth in another video. But secondly, Keanu is so likable partially because he embraces his kinesthetic nature which leads him to spending time doing what he loves. He's passionate about motorcycles, he loves to do his own stunts, and even the feel of vinyl records is important to him. There's so many things in life we're losing a kind of materiality — a haptic quality, a contact. So if you're interested, we can make a whole video on identifying people's primary modality but for the purpose of this video, when you see that someone is heavily kinesthetic, spend more one-on-one time with them while doing an activity. It's more effective than simply relying on conversation even if fewer words are being exchanged. Likewise, if you're a kinesthetic type and you're looking to make more friends, avoid going to dinners or cocktail parties or bars or clubs. Instead, participate in groups that make some kind of activity the focal point around which socializing can occur. Now, that's enough of a digression for now. We've arrived at what I think is the most important thing that makes Keanu Keanu and that is his character. I don't obviously know the guy but by all accounts from his colleagues, he's a very generous person. For instance, he did this for the cast of The Matrix Reloaded. He managed to secure 12 custom Holly Davidsons for each of the guys and kind of surprised the whole crew with that. That may not impress you because Keanu does have a lot of money but what is certainly impressive is his generosity with his time. His interactions with fans appear unrushed. And he was the only person to stop on the side of the road and help Octavia Spencer when her car broke down. He didn't know who she was. He just decided to pull over and push her broken down car as other people sped past. My car broke down at the middle of the crazy intersection at sunset until Keanu Reeves. Oh, he did? I was gonna have him, you know, get in and I was gonna push it and he was like, no, no, I'm gonna push you and I'm thinking, oh, he's gonna touch my car. And that's not to mention all the other fun internet anecdotes about Keanu like the time that he hung out with a homeless guy or entertained passengers on a flight after they had to make an emergency landing and take a van to their destination through Bakersfield. ...population is around 380,000, making it the 9th most populous city in California and the 52nd most populous city in the nation. I think the reason that most people are not this open is not because they don't know how to be but because they're scared. Connecting with strangers especially those who want or need something from you can be scary but despite having more people that would love to absorb his time, money, and energy than almost anyone, Keanu has more compassion than almost anyone. Let's be real. Most people don't stop to help the person in the broken-down car or to hang out with the homeless and it's that willingness to give that makes him someone to admire even when his charisma or public speaking isn't pitch-perfect. So if you want to start developing character like this, if you want to be more giving, realize that Keanu is able to do this in large part because he has defined what doesn't matter. He doesn't have any social media nor does he go to socialite parties nor does he seem to worry about stuff. Puppies bite his shoes in this next clip and rather than protect his fancy things, he just goes with the flow. Say hi, communicate. All right, we're good and you're eating my shoelace. Okay, go ahead and eat my shoelace. If you're interested in developing more of this kind of character, in being more compassionate, more generous, and generally happier when life throws you curveballs, you too will have to define what does not matter to you. You can't prioritize everything. The good news is that if you do decide to let go of caring about your name brand stacked wardrobe or your follower count or your income relative to your peers, you free up space for other things — for the things that tend to make people truly happy — your relationships, the work that you are passionate about and giving back. Now, if you do that, you think of yourself less without thinking less of yourself and then you too may start dropping Zen gems like Keanu. What do you think happens when we die, Keanu Reeves? I know that the ones who love us will miss us. Now, as I was making this video, I saw that PewDiePie also did one on Keanu and it ended like this. So in the spirit of Keanu Reeves and making this video, I wanted to donate all the profit that this video makes to the Leukemia Research Foundation. And reflecting on that and spending all week researching Keanu's generosity and kindness, I was inspired to do something that I've been saving up for for a good while. The plan was for this to be a birthday event in October but Keanu and then PewDiePie convinced me to not wait. So in honor of Keanu's generosity and to echo PewDiePie's donation, we're going to be donating $100,000 to Charity Water and it would mean the world to us if you joined us in making a contribution as well. Now, to be clear, my donation is only possible due to you. If you've watched our videos or joined Charisma University, you are the reason that Charisma on Command exists. Like Keanu says, we are not here at all without our fans and it is 100% thanks to all of you that over 3,000 people will have their lives transformed by getting access to clean water. Charity Water's entire mission is to get clean water to people who don't have access to it — people who might be walking miles just to have drinking water for their day who are getting sick and even dying from contaminations in dirty water. So to make a den and to do something good, Ben and I set up a campaign at charitywater.org. The first $100,000 is already in there and if you're feeling inspired by Keanu or PewDiePie or us or the people whose lives you will change, please consider donating. $30 gives one person access to clean water for roughly 10 years but truly, any amount makes a difference and quite frankly, caring enough to give anything is a sign that the world is in good hands. Again, thank you. I cannot believe that we have arrived at a point where a donation of this size is even fathomable for us. I never thought this would be possible and we owe it all to you. We're very excited to pay it forward. I hope that you guys have enjoyed this video. I'll see you in the next one. you\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 751}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"No matter who you are, we've all been nervous before, and sometimes your nervousness can get in the way of making a good impression or connecting with someone you like. But being nervous doesn't have to ruin an interaction. There are ways to be incredibly charismatic even if you're nervous. That's what we'll be learning in today's video on Tom Hiddleston. Now I'm not saying Tom is always nervous, but he's a great person to learn this from. He's incredibly likable despite showing some telltale signs of nervousness in interviews, like filler words, fidgeting, and blushing. Here's a quick example. Despite those habits, Tom is considered extremely charismatic, humble, and charming. So in this video, we'll break down 5 easy tricks you can learn from Tom to come off as charismatic even when you're nervous. Once you learn a few of these tricks, you'll have people saying things like this about you too. The first trick is extremely easy and has an impact both on how you feel and how you're perceived. People often make their first judgment on whether or not they like someone within five seconds of seeing them. In Tom's case, his tailored suits, good posture, and big smile dominate how you perceive him so that even when he's stuttering or using filler words, he still seems charismatic. Beyond that, what you wear has a psychological effect in your mind. Tom describes it nicely here. This doesn't mean you have to wear suits all the time, especially if that's not your style. But when you think you look good, it'll make you feel more confident and give you courage in those moments you feel nervous. So don't just dress to blend in with the crowd, dress in a way that makes you stand with confidence. The next trick you can steal from Tom is for when you're in conversation. It's to use a one-second cliffhanger pause. Most nervous people make the mistake of thinking they have to fill conversational silence. So if they're nervous and their mind goes blank, they will fill the silence with ums and uhs as they struggle to think of something to say. You're much better served to simply stop talking and collect yourself. Not only does pausing for a breath help you internally calm your nerves, it actually makes your stories more captivating and your jokes get bigger laughs. As an example, here's Tom talking about filming the elevator scene in Thor Ragnarok. Watch carefully. See if you notice a pattern in how he uses pauses. As you may have noticed, the key is to pause in the middle of your sentence, not at the end. Pausing at the end might confuse people into thinking you're done speaking, leading them to jump in and accidentally cut you off. Pausing mid-sentence safely buys you a moment and keeps people hooked. A mid-sentence pause is also a great way to make something funnier. Here's a quick example with Tom telling a story on The Graham Norton Show. It's not an especially funny sentence, so why does it get a laugh? 1. A pause builds anticipation. 2. Humor is often about defying expectations, and a brief pause lets the listener try to guess what you're going to say so that what you do say can be unexpected. If you struggle to maintain eye contact when you're nervous, pausing also lets you cheat. You can look away as you think of what to say and then return to making eye contact as you speak. Just make sure to look up and to the side rather than down. Another quick thing you can focus on to help your impression if you're nervous is keeping your voice confident using pace and timbre. Notice in this next clip of Tom, he says, um, clears his throat, swallows, touches the back of his head, but his voice remains low and slow the entire time. A deep, calm voice can help you seem captivating and confident even if you happen to use filler words or have less than perfect body language. That said, don't try to make your voice unnaturally low. Just be aware if it sounds higher than normal because you're nervous. If so, take a breath and bring it back to your normal register. If you're interested in a few exercises to actually improve your voice, I'll link to our video on how to create an attractive voice at the end of this video. The next thing you can steal from Tom to be more charismatic when you're feeling nervous is commitment. For example, Tom is known for doing impressions. He's also known for greatly admiring Robert De Niro. Watch how nervous he gets when Graham starts to set him up by asking De Niro if he enjoys seeing people do impressions of him. He's clearly nervous. He touches his legs, knees, and thigh, fidgets, and licks his lips. But he still does the impression. There's two things to notice when he does it. Here's the first part. Think about what you notice. Tom gets a laugh before he even speaks because he commits fully with his face and body language. The second thing you saw is Tom didn't rush into the impression even though he's nervous. And as you'll see next, he doesn't cut himself short even though he's embarrassed to do it. Here's another example from a different appearance on The Graham Norton Show. Tom's here to promote I Saw the Light where he plays musician Hank Williams. Because of this, Graham asks him to yodel. Watch Tom's reaction. YouTube is strange about music copyrights so unfortunately we have to cut the clip there but he goes on to do a very committed yodel. Now, most of us don't do impressions or know how to yodel. But there's two things here that we can all take with us when we're in conversation. First, a common mistake that most people make when they're nervous is to keep their movements small and their body language tight. Instead, when you notice yourself feeling nervous, purposely open up your body and use more expansive gestures when you speak. Second, when you're nervous, you may feel an urge to cut yourself short, whether telling stories, doing impressions, or making a joke. But ironically, it's by cutting yourself short that you create a nervous impression. Now the easiest way to learn to commit to your stories and jokes is by changing your mindset when you're nervous. Especially in social situations, don't worry about being cool. Take your focus to have fun and create a fun atmosphere and people will love being around you. This is made way easier once you cultivate the ability to find humor in your embarrassment. This is the final piece that allows Tom to be so charming even when he's nervous. For example, watch as he tries to describe why he loves the waltz scene in Crimson Peak. Most people's public speaking nightmare is to misspeak in front of a large crowd and get laughed at and called out immediately. But you can see Tom has a big smile on his face. Here's another quick example. For context, he's talking about shooting the movie Kong Skull Island. First, notice again how he uses the mid-sentence pause to introduce the story. Now watch as Tom gets teased for his first dangerous location. I'm sure you know someone who would get defensive after basically being called a wuss in front of 3 million viewers. But unless the joke is genuinely offensive, you're much better off laughing and playing along. This ability to laugh when other people would get defensive is basically a charisma superpower. The people around you will be impressed with your confidence, but beyond that, you'll find yourself much more excited to go into social situations knowing no matter what, you're going to have a great time. And when you don't fear messing up or being playfully teased, a lot of your nervousness will naturally go away. A lot of the tips from this video like anchoring a positive first impression and using a cliffhanger pause, these are things you can start doing right away. Having the confidence to enjoy your most embarrassing moments, that's something that may take a little bit more time to build.

So here are just a few of the things that people have written in. This first one is from a guy who joined after a breakup. He says, Thank you so much for Charisma University. I thought that after completing this course I'd become a smooth talker and be able to take over a room. What I didn't realize is I get that and feel so confident in myself. I feel liberated. Thank you for creating this course. This next one is from a woman who works as a clinical psychologist. She says, I absolutely love the content and I am happy to pay for the modules. I'm a clinical psychologist looking for material that could help my clients who have social anxiety. Charlie's material is exactly what I was looking for. So excited to be a member of Charisma University. And this last one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career. He says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma, yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills, which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you have taught me.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"You're a sex addict, is that right? I don't know if it's right, but it's fun. So good. So good. Alright, so we are going to break down— No, that was lame. So we're gonna be covering one of my favorite charisma icons, Russell Brand. I truly think the guy is one of the sharpest people when it comes to speaking off the cuff and we're looking at his most savage moments. Some of these, I'm sure, I've seen. Some of them, I haven't. We're gonna be breaking down what he's doing and reacting, seeing what's going on. You know, what we do here. And personally, I am, of course, in spite of appearances, I'm a heterosexual man. Congratulations. People think, because I'm so well-dressed— He stunts David to silence. People think, because I'm so well-dressed, people think he must be gay. No, no, no. Look at his wonderful haircut, he must be gay. Look how sensitive and vulnerable he is, he must be gay. That means women feel safe around me, they trust me, then bang! Pregnant! Bang! Pregnant! Bang! Pregnant! Doubling down, I mean, he is so sharp, but look how many times he doubles down on a joke. They trust me, then bang! Pregnant! Bang! Pregnant! Bang! Pregnant! Third one is what gets the laugh. Incredible. I went down, I've been shark diving, which is kind of amazing, although I had a real close encounter with a shark recently. A little low, shark. It wasn't, it was about six feet, so— Did it eat people? Was it that tight? Well, it wasn't, but— Why are you trying to diminish my story? It's just the type of fish. You went near a fish. Let me tell the story. That's your story. I was near a fish once. That is a fantastic way to playfully tease someone right there. And the reason that it is good is because this is probably not something that she is sensitive about, so if he were teasing her, I don't know. If there was somebody who had just shared some vulnerable story about themselves and you found that that was the moment to make a sarcastic joke, probably not the best time. But she's telling a story about swimming with sharks, this isn't core to her identity, and he makes light of it in this way. This is actually a great way to build camaraderie and get close to people. Now, you're a sex addict, is that right? I don't know if it's right but it's fun. So good. So good. So this is one thing that he does that I wish I did more often is people, myself included, are so literal in conversation and he knows what she means but when you purposely misinterpret what people say just for the purpose of having fun, that creates such a more engaging and interesting conversation. So that's what he does right off the bat here. Alright, so I said, I've grown one already. I've already got a beard. They said, barf. I said, beard. I said, I've already grown it now. I can't go backwards. I've only got one direction. Up, out. You can't retract it. You can't persuade. You have to go, I apologize. There's two directions though. Up, out. I didn't mean any offense, sir. I'm sorry for your plight. Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for yours. My thoughts are with you. See, he just keeps talking. Yeah, he just keeps going until something good happens. Exactly. He is so comfortable not getting a reaction. Probably because he wants the reaction so badly that he'll just continue to plow forward but I feel like a lot of people trail off when the initial joke doesn't take hold and he doesn't. I like sex a lot. What I want to know is what's the difference between somebody who's really like sex and who's a sex addict? Did you go to a treatment center for that? Yes, I did, as a matter of fact. But the distinction, I think, Chelsea, with any compulsive or addictive... Actually, I watched this interview a long time ago and it has a bit of a hostile undertone to it. So it's interesting to see and I presume that it's deteriorated by the point that they're here because I look at him, he is... And who's a sex addict. Right here, sitting back in his chair, picking at his clothes, not looking at her. And actually reminds me of the MSNBC interview that he did where after it... He's very focused on people at the beginning but as it sort of devolves and it becomes clear that they're kind of messing with him, he starts spinning in his chair looking around not paying full attention which is actually a good thing. So I don't remember this interview exactly. I believe that's what's happening and if you sense someone is being passive-aggressive to you, this is a fantastic first move which is not to be rude or unkind necessarily back. It's just to not give them your full attention as you sense that they're continuing to be passive-aggressive. And what this does is it subtly encourages them to move back towards more honest, authentic questions which you can then engage with the fullness of your attention. This is just the right audience to do this with. This is perfect. How did that happen? When I was a crack and heroin addict, I made some unusual decisions. They included dressing in an inappropriate way on September the 11th. Now before I talk about this, remember I was on crack and heroin, Chelsea. And I challenge any of you to take crack and heroin and see how it affects your personal, private and professional life. This is an excellent way to talk about personal failures and embarrassment. When I was on crack and heroin, one, it goes right into it in a way that it undercuts the severity of it so it creates the moment of humor right there. But secondly, you can tell that he is not necessarily being judgmental and ashamed of himself for this and he communicates to the whole audience that this is something that they can, weirdly enough, understand and forgive even though if they came across a crack and heroin addict in their real life, that might be someone that they felt a complete inability to relate to. But because he's not treating this like a massive deal, the audience receives it. So a great example of a way to talk about things that you might not be so proud of is to really own them. Yes, I became addicted to heroin, crack cocaine, cocaine without the washing it up to make it into crack, amphetamines, marijuana, alcohol, moving about, looking out of windows, this position, all of those things. I couldn't stop myself. I'm genuinely envious of his ability to flow between sincere, deep conversation and total humor and he does it within a statement right here. So he's talking, he's listing out the drugs that he's taken and then he's into humor. I'm very jealous. Sadly, we've run out of time. We haven't run out of time, Tim. Time continues. So this is genuinely and he just shows a couple of examples. Purposeful misinterpretation of what someone literally says and just commenting on it. As silly as it sounds, when you reduce it to that, it sounds like this great school type of humor. Instead of understanding the subtext behind what someone says, comment on it as if they meant it literally, you might be surprised for the chances to make people laugh. Look at it. It's just everywhere. We don't even know what it is, do we? Let's be honest. It's entropy. It's space. And then he doubles down and this is what I acknowledge. Doubling down, anyone can do. Taking a joke and sort of adding tags to it, that's something that anyone can do. The lateral thinking, it's entropy, it's space. This is what is very, very difficult. The only way I know of to improve upon this, that is a system for doing this, is improv comedy. So if this is something that you look at and you're like, oh my gosh, I want this for myself, check out, see if there's an improv comedy store near you. Probably wait till the whole thing is over. But that's the way to become quickest and most lateral thinking on your feet like this. Chest hair, there's shirts. It's a landscape. I don't know what kind of landscape. He gets in there and makes eye contact. It's incredible. But it's some kind of landscape. What do you mean? Look at him, he can't see anymore. What's going on? It's chaotic. My landscape is extreme. A little bit of sunburn. A little hollowed out. I've just been down on the Gulf Coast. Where did he go? He slides in closer. Don't be distracted by that, it's fake. Because I was wondering, how did it get in here? Yeah. We need that to be in the sky for nighttime. He's great. He's funny as hell. And he's one of the tougher people to break down. If you want to see more of what we covered on him, check out the video that we did on his MSNBC interview that actually takes a lot of what he did and puts it into concrete steps. But I got to be honest, he is so articulate. His ability to speak off the cuff with words that are perfect for the situation, this is actually something that we covered in a way earlier video where we compare him to Donald Trump, is, again, something that is not often seen by celebrities. Most of them have stock stories that they tell the same way. I've watched a lot of Russell Brand interviews and while he does sometimes repeat himself, he will go on completely extemporaneous tirades that have no commonality with any other interview that I've ever seen and it's genuinely impressive. So I hope that you guys have enjoyed this video. If you have, make sure to hit the subscribe button. I know like 60% of our audience at this point has not done that so if you want to make sure to get future videos, go ahead, hit the subscribe button, hit the notification bell, and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"You're going to come across some conversational bullies in the course of your life. Now, generally, people try to shut them down with insults and aggression and some others prefer to walk away from these interactions to avoid that kind of negativity. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit your mic. It's okay. Yeah, you're right. Thank you. But there is a third potentially more effective way to deal with these toxic people. Russell Brand, for instance, tries to take control of the conversation instead of shutting it down. This allows him to stand up for himself without coming across like a jerk. And his interview with three hosts at the MSNBC morning show is a perfect example of the main strategies that you can use to dominate any bully in any conversation. So let's begin by quickly covering the best practices for any group interaction. Then we'll come to what to do when things go sour. One general rule of thumb is that you want to make sure you don't leap into conversation only to be cut off. Otherwise, people will subconsciously believe that your opinions aren't worthy of being heard and you can actually get pushed around more. So when you begin talking, it's usually best to continue to the end of your sentence like this. You don't have to dominate the conversation or refuse to be interrupted during long monologues but you do need to speak with enough momentum to at least finish each sentence before yielding the floor to someone trying to interrupt you. This is going to lead to people being far more likely to listen when you share your opinions and you can contrast the feeling that you get from watching Russell do this... ...with a young Jaden Smith who does not. It's not that Jaden's thoughts don't have any merit. It's that he hadn't yet learned to speak with enough conviction to be taken seriously. By at least finishing your sentences, you encourage others to respect you more. Now, the next principle that is extremely valuable in any group setting is to treat each member of a group as an individual. Obviously, a concrete way to do this is by referring to each person by their name. I admit this can feel awkward at first if you're not used to it but it actually has a very positive effect on the person who is hearing their favorite word in the English language. But even if you don't know people's names, you can show that you value each individual by taking time to look at each person while you speak especially if someone is quiet or shy. Taking those three seconds to make eye contact with them while you speak goes a long way towards making them feel included. In fact, if you're finding that you lose group's attention when telling a story or a joke, this is one of the quickest fixes. Give each individual a few seconds of your focus attention to keep them hooked. Now, lastly, we like people who are like us and who like us back so when you're in a group, it always helps to emphasize similarities with other members and to give genuine compliments. You've seen Russell did everything I mentioned but sometimes conversations turn hostile despite your best efforts so I want to show you how to disarm people who become aggressive in a way that is both subtle and charismatic way before you actually have to get direct with them. The first thing to realize here is that perhaps the most powerful tools that you have to influence the tone of a conversation are your nonverbal signals. Now, these can be grouped roughly into more signals and less signals. When you show these more signals, you'll get more of whatever you're responding to. Show less signals and you will get less. For example, watch how Russell gets Mika to switch from being rude and passive-aggressive... He's a really big deal. I know. I'm told this. I'm not very pop culture. I'm sorry. ...to complimenting him in an effort to win him over. You look fantastic. That is a very kind compliment. First, we have that calm stare in the eye with neither malice nor a smile. This is going to make anyone who is being rude feel uncomfortable doing so. It's like they're being watched. Second, not paying attention to that person will also make them change their tact. You see Russell's attention wander and it immediately makes the host feel to be kind in order to win him back. And third, the prolonged silence. This is one of the most powerful nonverbal tools at your disposal. When people are unkind, you may feel an impulse to quickly speak or to smile so as to diffuse the situation or cut that uncomfortable tension but Russell doesn't. He waits until Mika compliments him and then speaks up quickly. Maybe I could loosen up a little, show a little more chest hair. No. I only think Russell can do that. You look fantastic. That is a very kind compliment. Now that she's gone through that bit of rudeness and has returned to being kind, he gives strong more signals. This is going to work in a one-two punch where he says, don't do this but do this and see if you can spot these more signals. You also look beautiful. Brian, you are free to wear whatever you want. This is one of your freedoms that is afforded to you. I appreciate that. First, Russell verbally applauds what Mika says. Now calling out any sort of behavior that you appreciate is going to elicit more of it. Then, he returns her compliment and finally, he becomes playful and smiles. Now, of course, all of this is on top of the fact that he's engaging in a much more enthusiastic way. This dispels that tension that was mounting and strongly associates it with a more polite way of behaving. People do not like tension in conversations so don't get rid of it while they're being mean. Wait till they are kind. All of this is a strong more behavior signal that adds up to a nonverbal statement about what kind of behavior he expects throughout this conversation. Now, he continues to send these signals paying much more attention to Mika who's being more courteous than to the other host, Brian, who is continuing to be rude. In fact, Brian starts to make a comment that he later finishes about how he can't understand Russell's accent and suspecting that that guy is headed in a bad direction, Russell flat-out ignores him. This is a great strategy. It's funny though because I travel a lot. These people are at work, aren't they? Yeah, they're working. They're just at work. Work more quietly! This effectively makes Brian's next question much more courteous and we see Russell respond positively. Everyone asks, what do you like better — TV, movies, or stand-up? Actually, which one's more difficult? I mean, going on stage, I think, is probably pretty tough. Movie can be boring because you shoot a thing a hundred times. TV is what it is. There are challenges in all of those different disciplines. The thing I enjoy most is stand-up comedy. You can do the same thing in group conversations. If someone's being insulting, passive-aggressive, rude, pay attention to other members of the group. Turn so that your body faces those people. Smile, be warm, engaging, even loud with them. It shouldn't take very long before that rude person says something more kind at which point you can shift attention their way. Now, one final indirect option is to do a those types call-out. Now, this is where you speak about a type of behavior that you don't like, perhaps a type of behavior that someone in that group is currently doing but you allow that individual to save face by not calling them out directly. Instead, it's about those types of people. Do this with a smile to remind the person that you're still on the same team, they don't have to be the type of person you're describing, and you're not yet saying they are. Watch how Russell does this in his answer. You know what happens if you work in media? People like to change the information so that it suits a particular agenda. If you're in a room with people, then what you're saying is clear. If you say something that people are confused about, you can explain it to them then. If you say something because it's a joke, people can't pretend that you're saying it seriously. So I like having direct communication with people because I believe people are very, very intelligent but the information gets manipulated a lot and people like to cause fake stirs and stuff. The those types strategy is a sneaky way to influence the tone of any sort of conversation. Imagine being at a networking event and complimenting one group on their enthusiasm, talking about those other types who are a little bit dull and boring. You can bet that that group's energy will rise to meet that stellar reputation you've given them and not be like those other people. Now, unfortunately, these signals do go unheeded in Russell's case as they rarely but sometimes do in real life. The hosts continue to be rude. Brian abruptly says that he can't understand Russell's accent. The accent, you know, when I see him in person, it's totally fine. Forgetting Sarah Marshall or the TV show, it's fine. But on satellite radio in the car, I can't understand a single joke you say. You can't understand it. Another host forgets his name. Would you do therapy with Willie Brandt? With who? Willie Brandt. Would you do therapy with him? That is where Willie is heading. Who is Willie? And they all start speaking about Russell in the third person like he's not present. It's just sort of taking it all in. You are talking about me as if I'm not here and as if I'm an extraterrestrial. You know I'm from a country that's near to you. We're just sort of admiring the whole, you know, it's the whole thing. After nonverbal and then the indirect those type warnings, sometimes you have to go direct and flat out say what behavior you would like to see done differently. You shouldn't say he when a person is present. You should refer to the person by their name. That's basically good manners. That is where Willie is heading. Stop saying he. I'm present. Russell, what's wrong with your manners? You're good at that. Now, a lot of people mess this up and just make things get even more hostile. The key here is to criticize specific behavior not the people doing it. When you say that someone is a jerk, it's likely to make them defensive and doesn't specify how you would like them to change. When you say instead, don't call me by that name or don't speak to me in such a loud tone, you'll be much more likely to get what you want. Now, admittedly, what Russell does here is hard — staying calm enough to keep steady eye contact, not getting riled up when people take an antagonizing tone, maintaining that sense of humor through all of this. Most of us would probably just sweat and either underreact or overreact. So I want to share just one last mindset that takes a while to develop but will help a ton. You need to learn to detach your ego from personal attacks. Watch how Brand is able to take a personal criticism, namely, that he isn't qualified to speak on a particular topic, and brush it off as disconnected from the points that he's making. I'm not having a go at you about that. I'm just asking you why we should take you seriously when you're so unspecific. You don't have to take — well, firstly, I don't mind if you take me seriously. I'm here just to draw attention to a few ideas. And here, look how Brand is able to see that something is offensive without necessarily feeling personally offended or getting defensive about it. I want to bring you a sign, first of all. This says, Fag Pimp Brand. Absolutely. Make yourself comfy, mate. Now, this, of course, is clearly offensive as an object. Unlike most of us, Russell doesn't feel the need to immediately defend himself from personal attacks because he isn't heavily invested in what most people think of him. He wastes no mental energy on protecting his ego which allows him to be wittier in the face of criticism. Paradoxically, not defending himself actually makes him come across better than if he did. That's not a very flattering photograph. That's the face you made. You made the face. I made the face. I pays the price. Fair enough. That's true. Now, we'll actually be talking about all the different tools that you can use for humor including how to develop more of the speedy wit in a future video which is going to continue to break this clip down. Yes, there is a ton happening in seven minutes but that will likely be out next month since we have some big videos planned. In the meantime, Keanu Reeves, Tom Holland, potentially, Andrew Yang so if you want to make sure that you don't miss on that video or any of the other ones that I've just mentioned, make sure to hit subscribe and to turn on notifications now. That way, you're going to get a message when those come up and it won't be something that you never hear of again. Anyway, one of the things that will allow you to begin to detach your ego from any sort of particular attack is a deeper sense of self-acceptance. If you feel comfortable with yourself, with who you are at a base level, what other people think or say is much less likely to phase you and rile you up. When you have solid self-acceptance, all of your self-worth doesn't come from being praised or well-liked. It comes from a belief that you are enough no matter the opinions of others. Now, this is, quite frankly, a long journey — one that takes time to integrate but if you would like to get started today, I have created a guided meditation that is focused on developing that deep sense of self-acceptance and you can get it today for free courtesy of this video's sponsor, Simple Habit. Simple Habit is a meditation app that has a ton of different guided meditations that help train your brain more towards the emotions that you want. Now, I have had ones that have been very impactful for me specifically with gratitude, joy, positivity — since those things can be hard for me from time to time, I tend to be very achievement-oriented, always focusing on what needs to be done and not enjoying the moment. I also actually spent a lot of time on my own doing self-guided meditations without any sort of track because I couldn't find one that was both fast and powerful so I decided to make one that was what I would have wanted and I put it on the Simple Habit app. So, if you join Simple Habit at simplehabit.com slash confidence on your phone, you can listen to that guided meditation that I designed specifically for self-acceptance and you can also get another one that I created that is about stressful social situations. You listen to it before you go out and it primes you to be at your best. Not only that, you get access to every single meditation that they have for a full week and if you do decide to check it out, I would definitely recommend Seven Days of Joy. Now, if you like the app and you decide to stay past that first week, it is $11.99 a month very well spent for unlimited access to every guided meditation they have. And if it's not for you, you can just cancel and lose nothing. So, if you'd like to check out the guided meditation that I create or any of the others, there's nothing to lose — you can check that acceptance meditation out at simplehabit.com slash confidence on your phone since it is an app. Either way, I hope that you have enjoyed this video and I very much look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 842}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Jamie Foxx is insanely charismatic. Some people mistakenly think he's just an over-the-top comedian because of jokes like this one. I did calves one time and the next morning, I got out of bed like, Oh, my God! — laughter — While he does use physical comedy at times, Jamie is a magnetic storyteller and amazing conversationalist. He can even lead a conversation while spending most of it just listening and asking the right questions. So today, we're going to break down a few of Jamie's habits and how you can use these habits to become funnier, more magnetic, and a more likable listener. If you can become even one of those three things, people will love being around you. — I mean, I'm taken back by these stories, man. Honestly, I feel like I should pay you for sitting here listening to this. — The first thing Jamie does in most conversations is set a playful tone from the start. For example, most guests coming on to Jimmy Kimmel Live just walk out, wave to the audience, and take a seat. Instead, Jamie comes in high-energy and is immediately striking goofy poses, getting people to do the wave, and joking with the audience. — Woo! — laughter — — The wave has dissipated over here. The lady in the front said, Mm-hmm, come on. Come on, Jamie, give me some of that. — This doesn't mean to try to get the wave started every time you enter a party, but most people enter meetings or social gatherings nervous, which causes them to be low-energy. So they keep their voices quiet and their gestures small. Then they struggle when they suddenly see someone they want to make a good impression on. If instead, you make a point to be a bit louder and higher-energy from the moment you walk in, you'll find it's much easier to get social momentum and feel outgoing. If you want to start small, try building the habit of smiling every time you enter a new room. That said, don't force yourself to be goofy the whole time. Part of what makes Jamie charismatic is his ability to switch gears and be genuine when the moment calls for it. — How are you doing? How's your life going? — Man, how are you doing? — I'm doing well, thank you. — I saw— I know I'm breaking protocol, but I saw something about you and your kid. It was fantastic. I just gotta— I said, when I see you in person— — Oh, thank you, man. Thank you. — He's doing very well. — Once Jamie sees that genuine moment is well-received and Jamie understands that he means it, he goes back to cracking jokes. — He's doing great, by the way. People keep— I feel weird because, you know— — It makes you feel weird, because when I did that, you went, Oh, goodness. I gotta be serious. — So, to start, let's go over some quick, easy ways you can get people laughing. One of Jamie's go-to ways to get a laugh is by teasing himself. As a quick example, watch his reaction after Ellen shows a clip of him doing pull-ups and says his body is impressive. — Because, you know, brothers don't do legs. — Really? — No, no, no. Like, we're big at the top and sort of small at the— Like, I could beat you up, but I can't chase you, because— — Oh, okay. — I'm like, you know, I'm like, yeah. — It's worth noting, while he is teasing himself, that burn has no heat. No one cares if he has small legs, so it's not actually something that puts him down. Here's another example from when he met NBA player Draymond Green. — I ran into Draymond Green. Come on, man. — Yeah, right. — In the back? — Yeah, he was gonna be mad when he hears all of this. He'd be like, why are you crying for me? — I said, what's up, Draymond? He said, what's up, Fox? How you doing? — There's zero shame in being smaller than an NBA forward. — So he's making fun of himself, but not actually putting himself down. Again, a burn with no heat. What you can and can't tease about yourself is subjective, and it comes down to being honest with yourself about what areas you're comfortable and what areas you're a bit insecure. For instance, a lot of people are insecure about being out of shape, but even when he's not in top form, Jamie has no problem making a joke like this. — You got the body right. — I had to get the body right. — You didn't do like me, like I have a spank on, right? See, you didn't spank it out. — See, this is all spank. Muscles. Spank. — Teasing yourself like that makes people laugh, and it shows confidence. That said, even if you're the one that initiates the joke, if people are laughing at something you're insecure about, there's a risk it's going to bother you, especially because it also invites other people to tease you for the same thing. So to start, only tease areas that aren't major insecurities. You can combine this with another habit Jamie does incredibly well, which is storytelling. Jamie is a magnetic storyteller. He's able to tell stories that make you laugh or that captivate you and hit you emotionally. One thing you'll notice about Jamie is the way he tells stories really takes you through the experience with him. Two things create that feeling. He tells present-tense stories with a variety of voices. For example, listen to him tell the story of his first audition with Tom Cruise. — Tom Cruise reads his line, but it was like this. It was — — so I thought he'd lost his place. I couldn't hear him so I said we were like, I know I said the line I'm waiting on you. I'm like, oh, uh oh And again, you saw he exaggerates to his detrament at the end to get a laugh. One other thing to notice, as he gets into his stories, Jamie smiles with his eyes and speaks through a smile which primes people to smile and laugh with him. If you've ever seen someone tell the same joke as you but get a bigger laugh, this or speaking louder was probably why. Here's another example. Watch for present tense, a variety of voices, and smile priming. Like, you know, I'm 49. So I was DJing at this club and these girls was about to DJ booth and they were just so young. Like, I said, well, how old are you? They said, I'm 22. I'm 23. Oh my gosh, she's ancient. She's 27. I'm like, wow, yeah. Also notice he pauses at his punchline before continuing. And the girl asked me how old I was. 49. Oh my God. Can't you die from 49? Come on girls, let's pray he has 49. Those five elements make up the bulk of Jamie's funny stories. The best part is you don't even have to master all five to become a magnetic storyteller. Pick one or two to focus on to start. You'll notice your stories get a better reaction almost instantly. Jamie relies on the power of pauses even more when he's telling serious stories. He does this by using a special kind of pause — a cliffhanger pause. Sometimes it's only half a second, but it grabs your attention. Here's a quick example. Because when we were nominated for the Oscars... Most people pause at the end of their sentences. Instead, Jamie pauses at a point that's clearly mid-sentence. This creates a moment of curiosity and triggers the human desire to know how things end. Here's a longer example. This is Jamie describing how powerful it was to watch Michael B. Jordan give his final speech in Just Mercy. You finished that speech and what you didn't see behind you was... See? Aren't you at least a little curious what was behind him? The extras in this courtroom gave you a standing ovation. The fear people have with pausing is that they'll get cut off, but there's a solution to that potential problem. In this next clip, watch how Jamie uses his hand to show he isn't done speaking even through this incredibly long emotional pause. For context, he's sharing his experience after his father was sentenced to jail for seven years. I said, I told my pops, I can't come see you. By keeping your hand up in the gesture you were using while speaking, you make it clear you aren't finished. But I wrote him... I wrote him a letter. I said, hey, you know, things have gotten good for me. When you get out, I'll save your life. So if you're ever speaking and want to make sure you maintain people's attention while you pause, keep your hand gesture up until you continue. So far, we've talked about how to be an amazing conversationalist while doing most of the talking, but there's another way to have people love speaking with you, which is by being a likable listener. Jamie follows the standard listening advice like making eye contact and facing his body towards you, but he has another habit beyond that that makes him someone that people really enjoy talking to. He asks talk-about questions. Here's an example. In front of and behind the camera, you were absolutely amazing. Talk about the birth of Just Mercy. How did that come about? Michael went on to answer that question for four minutes straight. There's a few good rules for getting people to enjoy talking to you. Get them talking about things they're excited about or are proud of, especially things that other people don't often ask about. The goal is to ask a question that someone is genuinely excited to answer. Then use the phrase talk-about to elicit a more thoughtful response. It's a phrase Jamie uses often. Talk about what it means to be positive to everybody. But talk about the significance of the word. Conversation can feel stilted or awkward if you ask a lot of questions that can be answered with one word. Instead, ask open-ended questions, specifically ones that allow people to speak at length about things they care about. Now, one thing I noticed in a few comments recently is that people aren't quite sure how to implement everything from our videos, which makes sense. It's a lot to work on at once. If becoming more charismatic is a goal of yours, you should check out Charisma University. It's a step-by-step 30-day program we made so you know exactly what to do and when. You're guaranteed to feel way more confident and charismatic, and if for whatever reason you don't, then you can get a full refund just by pushing a button inside the course. Thousands of people have gone through Charisma University so far and had great results. Here's what just a few of them have said. Thank you. You changed my life. It's so much easier for me to connect with people. All of my relationships have improved and I am able to make new friends anywhere in any situation. I never expected such remarkable outcomes from a simple online routine. This course completely changed my mindset on how to approach people and think about myself. It has undoubtedly made a significant impact on my life. Everything in my life has improved from loving myself and others more to creating and developing amazing external relationships. There's so much joy in my life and CU has been a huge reason for it.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"How's it going, everybody? Today, we are looking at some comebacks. Now, I haven't watched any of these before, but we're going to see what we can learn about the way that people responded in these clips to particular offenses and insults and what you might learn in your own life if somebody comes at you in a way that you find a bit too aggressive. Do you go in the water or the ocean a lot? Are you... Because some people hate the ocean. No, I like the ocean. I do. I like the ocean very much. Yeah. That's great. You must... Do you float a lot in the ocean? Sure. What, do you sink? Might be that cast-iron heart. That's perfect. That is perfect. So this can be a great, great technique when somebody is insulting to you, and this is actually one that plays in real life. Somebody says something that implies an insult, answer it very, very literally. Sometimes, you can kill them with kindness because they'll say something that has a sarcastic subtext. You respond like it's a compliment, and the conversation, either they have to insist that they were no being rude to you and you need to get the subtext, or they're kind of forced to just have given you a compliment because you've received it as one. So that's a good handle. If it's coming across rude or unkind, to just call it out as mean can be an incredibly effective response. What's his name? Hans Taylor. Can you do a little bit of singing? He's a Dutch absurdist. One of the things he does is he brings out a sock puppet, which is a black sock. See, already, I don't like them. Yeah, no. All right, all right. It's a white sock. Oh, yeah. I've seen parts of this before, and the way that Bo Burnham, and the video is perfectly titled, he burns in the green room, and he earned respects from all these comics with a wit that is just so sharp. And this is, we've talked about this kind of thing, very tough to do in the moment, but purposeful misinterpretation. And he absolutely nails it right there by misinterpreting what he said, cracking a joke, super witty, tough to replicate, though. I'm curious, but the UK's House of Parliament is wild. Order! Order! Order! Order! Coming from America and seeing how we conduct things in the Senate and the Congress, this is where charisma and burns and shouting over people actually seems to be integral to the politics in the UK. Andy Coulton to the heart of the British government. It's good to see the honorable gentleman on such good form. I often say to my children, no need to go to the National History Museum to see a dinosaur. Come to the House of Commons at about half past twelve. Statements! What the hell is this? Order! Look at this guy's trying not to laugh. Order! He's trying not to laugh. This, as shown in American politics in the last four or so years, is incredibly effective, and even before the last four years. I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there. Just punching back and not acknowledging what has been said is more effective at swaying the masses, weirdly enough. And because you're not even addressing what has been said about you, you're swinging back. I don't recommend this for your own life, because it's not a way to address, one, what might be a flaw in your own way of living or thinking, and two, it's not going to make you any friends. But if all you need to do is get 51% of the people to back you, or at least 51% of the people in particular states, this is proven to be incredibly effective. It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country. Because you'd be in jail. Secretary Clinton... And what you actually see there is another example of purposefully misinterpreting why somebody would say that. The other thing that I remember is that during her campaign, temperament was this big thing that she was trying to hammer home that he's unhinged, that he's out of control and crazy. And he was able to effectively make the temperament argument work against her by saying, no, you're afraid of my temperament because it's going to be bad for you, not because it's going to be bad for Americans. What you should probably do is lay down and just let the sun cook it off. Oh, that seems like an excellent idea, but I'm not as dumb as I look. How could you be? Oh, that's not a comeback. That's just a burn. Safe to assume that they're messing around that she doesn't actually hate him and isn't regularly ragging on him. When somebody cracks a joke at your expense, sometimes, in fact, many times when it's a friend, the best thing that you can do is join in and laugh because if you resist it and you don't have a clever comeback for it, you just look insecure about it. So we are back a few days later. You can see how my quarantine work ethic has been, but we're going to finish this video right now. And one thing that actually occurred to me, I do have some other clips that I want to show, but there's a fictional character that has some excellent comebacks. And it's the breakdown that I wish I did. We kind of missed it and it's Jamie Lannister. I've had this clip in my back pocket for a while. So what you're going to see in this back and forth is that Ned is insinuating without actually saying that Jamie is a coward, he doesn't fight, and you're going to see that insinuated multiple times. And his response is almost always to agree and expand. This kind of a response where you agree with him is very disarming because it shows that you are not affected. And if you can't come up with something super witty in the moment, just to agree and let them know that you're unaffected can be quite a powerful comeback. Some things, yes, and other things, I like to take my time, if you know what I mean. I've absolutely no idea what you mean. Somehow, I don't doubt that. It's a little bit of a verbal Aikido, verbal Jiu-Jitsu is where you're using what somebody else said against them, which is why this agreeing thing is so useful. And as I think about it, when you fight and rage against something that somebody said to you, even if it's mean, if you don't come up with a really witty comeback when you're fighting them, you look like you've overreacted. So interestingly, if you can just agree and go with it, you might have a really interesting comeback. And in the cases where you don't, you at least are coming across like you're not terribly affected by what they've said. This is a tough business to run for president. You're a tough guy, G. And we need to have a leader. This determined the presidency in a big way. Let's see, I'm at 42 and you're at 3, so so far I'm doing better. So far I'm doing better. You know, you started off over here, Jeb. You're moving over further and further. Pretty soon you're going to be off the end. So this is interesting. There's nothing necessarily witty about what's being said here, but what Trump is doing is effectively changing the subject. Sometimes just talking over someone, if they don't handle it well and they clam up in the way that Bush kind of did, where he had nothing left to say, he looked exasperated, it just made him look what Trump was saying, which is he looked weak. This is where I started paying attention to Donald Trump. So it is not worth it to correct someone's grammar in an unkind or rude way. But if you do that, you are opening yourself up to any mistake that you ever make, like you put a preposition at the end of a sentence, which I'm sure I've done a million times in this video. You don't want to set up this kind of precedent for yourself. So be understanding of mistakes that people make and their pronunciation or the words that they use, and if you want to be helpful at a separate point in time, you can correct them. Tangent done. So I hope that you guys enjoyed this video for the second time and we got it done in a handful of days. If you liked it, go ahead, subscribe. Let me know what you think of the blue background. I think it's blue. A lot of you were very confused when I said it was green last time because either I'm colorblind or it's not coming across the way that I'm seeing it on camera. But let me know what colors you guys like. If you have other suggestions for things that I can react to or talk about and... If you have other suggestions for things that I can react to, go ahead and let us know in the comments. Either way, hope that you enjoyed the video and I will see you in the next one. Peace.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Sometimes, arguments can get heated and spiral out of control. How about more than a billion people who aren't fanatical, who don't punch women, who just want to go to the store... Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. And while we all want to win our arguments, not making an enemy in the process can be even more important which is why today we're going to be looking at Trevor Noah and what you can learn from him about coming out of verbal scruffs not only on top but looking cool, calm, and collected. First off, Trevor has a simple but effective habit to prevent emotions from getting too heated. His sub-communications indicate that he isn't there for a fight. To see this principle in action, take a look at this exchange from his debate with Tommy Lahren and notice Trevor's tone of voice compared to Tommy's. That's not fair and that's true. No, no, no, no. No, it is fair, Trevor, because the shooter said — point-blank, shooter said he's doing this because of Black Lives Matter. Yes, and there are many things you can say. As people get more frustrated, they have a tendency to raise their voices and talk faster like Tommy does here. In this case, both sides' ability to change their mind completely shuts down and they dig into their positions to prepare for a verbal sparring match. You can tell that this is beginning to happen when both people rush to talk over one another like here. I go, I saw people and race as chalky. I wouldn't use that. I'm that color. In these sorts of situations, no matter how good your point is, it's not going to be well-received so the first order of business is simply to slow things down and indicate that fighting isn't necessary. So as Trevor gains control, you can see him deliberately pause in these situations which reduces the tension and opens the other person up to his perspective. ...that color. I wouldn't say that. When I grew up, I believed that all people were chocolates. A very basic but tried-and-true method when this starts to happen to you is simply to take a deep breath as you are about to speak. It helps to slow things down tremendously. Now, another key element that indicates Trevor isn't looking to fight is his inflection. In last week's Harvey Specter breakdown, we talked about how a downward inflection can be a powerful tool when you're giving commands and that may have given the impression that upward inflections are somehow bad. This is definitely not the case, though. In fact, upward inflections are excellent for de-escalating conflict because it reassures others that you're not commanding them or trying to control them which is what gets most people upset in arguments in the first place. ...because you're the first person I've met who said this. I've seen this message online. I'm not labeling you as the bad person. I just want to know if you've ever thought of the how. That's all I want to know. The last key piece you see from Trevor about sub-communicating that you're not there for a fight is simply the ability to crack a joke. It might seem counterintuitive to slow down the flow of debate with moments of levity but this actually makes you more persuasive since you're sub-communicating that you are on the same side as someone when you can laugh with them. Now, there's obviously tons of ways to crack jokes but it can be as simple as misinterpreting a word like here. ...and then I got closer to the campaign and I started seeing some of the things he was saying and I started seeing the effect he was having on people and the things that he was saying that was touching people and making them feel like they... He was touching people. Yeah, he was. He really was. Or just about any argument, you can just poke fun at the fact that both sides typically want to demonize one another like here. You're one of the good ones. Cracking jokes like this will help release some of the tension that comes when you're debating fiercely held beliefs and hopefully move you towards a more constructive outcome. However, keep in mind that if you are going to make jokes, you need to also be willing to take a joke and to laugh at it even when that joke targets your side like here. He's really crazy. Partially crazy. Hey, that works in Washington. You got Bernie. This should give you a good base of sub-communications but the literal words that you use are important too and that's why the next point is that whenever possible, ask questions instead of making statements. The reason this is so significant is that questions tend to come across as less confrontational than statements provided that they're not provocative accusatory questions. Now, there's two general kinds of questions that Trevor uses. First, you see genuine questions aimed at better understanding the other person's viewpoint. Again, note the upward inflection in this next clip that indicates he's seriously curious. And now, I would like to know from your side genuinely as someone who's won, do you believe that Donald Trump will follow through on his promises? The goal of these type of questions is to fully understand the opposing position. So many people get into debates with the straw man of the person that they're debating assuming that they believe things that the Democrats believe or Republicans believe or Christians believe or atheists believe or whatever. You must recognize that you do not know any individual's beliefs simply by knowing one of their affiliations. You need to get to what they believe as an individual and genuine questions are the only way there. To make sure that you're actually understanding someone correctly, a fantastic tool is to try to state back to them their own beliefs in your words and to not proceed until they confirm that you've actually got it. You see this right here. You're saying that populism both on Trump's side and on the left, there's a danger of that hurting America's... That's right. There's nothing wrong with a little populism. Keep in mind, though, it's not simply about using the words, so you're saying and then putting words in the other person's mouth. We saw that in the Jordan Peterson-Cathy Newman debate that you need to make a genuine good-faith attempt to rephrase the other's position not like you see here. You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters. Now, once you have a good grasp of someone's beliefs, you can begin to ask the second main type of question — questions that probe for inconsistencies and beliefs in a non-accusatory way. A very recent interview with the Republican Senator Rand Paul has a few great examples of this from Trevor. If two people do a bad thing, does it cancel each other out then? I'm saying that most people... People go, look at what happened to Venezuelan socialism. Then I go, does the corruption not count at all? You know, credit default swaps — that's capitalism running rampant. That's people going, you can buy a thing that doesn't exist and nobody understands it and you don't have to regulate it and then, all of a sudden, the markets crash, people lose their houses. Isn't that also capitalism? This questioning style of conversation is known as the Socratic method and it's the reason that Socrates is the most famous philosopher ever so use it. It works incredibly well. In short, you're first attempting to understand people's positions as best you can and then frame your disagreements in the form of questions. That gives the other person a chance to respond without feeling cornered and it makes them much less likely to be offended. Moving on to the next point, let's have a look at what to do when the positions are reversed and you're the one who is having your beliefs challenged but let's say it's in a way that you feel is unfair. Your main goal here is to confidently defend yourself without coming across as antagonistic and there is a surprisingly effective way to achieve both at the same time and it's something that I like to call, yes, but. Now, you've probably heard of yes and where you agree and then build upon someone's statement in order to develop on a joke like an improv comedy. In an argument, the same principle of finding agreement is very important. The only difference is that you're going to follow your agreement up by showing where you disagree — that's the but part. Now, for instance, in this next clip, Trevor says, yes, that he is splitting hairs but then goes on to say why that's the right thing to do. Take a look. You're splitting hairs here. No, but that is exactly what we should be doing because what you're doing is creating racial jokes. No, you're creating monoliths. It may seem subtle but finding any area of agreement can be critical to moving forward without making enemies. People's egos get tied up in their arguments and oftentimes, when you rebut someone completely, they feel personally attacked even if your position is perfectly logical. So find a way to validate them by saying yes to something about them or their argument. It could be recognizing the value of one part of what they said. No, I'll give you that. I'll give you that. It's nice to hear somebody say that the religion is not the problem. Or when you think nothing they've said makes sense, simply recognizing that they probably have positive intentions and believe what they're saying can be a really great way to move forward. Here's my thing. Like, all these points that you make are great and I do believe that you believe them and I don't believe anyone is actively trying. There are a few people who are trying to be bad from their point of view but when I look at what you're saying... Now, in order to do this technique effectively, you need to know specifically where you agree with someone and specifically where you don't. So identifying hidden premises is critical. Hidden premises are unspoken assertions baked into a question or a statement. When someone creates an argument that feels wrong but you can't quite explain why, sometimes that's because you can't find the hidden premise and sometimes it's because you're experiencing cognitive dissonance but we'll leave that for another video to focus on the hidden premise. Here's one quick example. See if you can spot it here. What do you say to people who say, like, the Daily Show can be an echo chamber? Did you catch the implied hidden premise? It's that being an echo chamber is a bad thing — something that you shouldn't be. So watch how Trevor responds. Everything is an echo chamber. I think that's a term that people use to try and justify what a group of people are saying in and amongst themselves. I think, for myself, you will always have an echo chamber because people who watch your show are people who like your show. This is a perfect example of yes but. In this instance, by saying, yes, the Daily Show is an echo chamber, he's validating Charlemagne but then saying that it's natural to be so, he roots out that hidden premise that it shouldn't somehow be an echo chamber and that way, he is able to agree but defend himself elegantly. And we discussed this topic further in our Ben Shapiro video if you'd like to play this game a few more times but for now, let's get to the mindset that ties all of this together because everything in this video can move from a simple technique to a natural way of being if you adopt new mindsets and there are three keys. First off, in every argument, you are not necessarily right and this is especially true if you've never amended your belief system be it political, religious, or otherwise. In those cases, chances are you're operating from conditioning so genuinely trying to understand other perspectives can help you towards a more accurate view of the world. Now, this is obviously very hard to do because your ego gets involved so the second key mindset is that adjusting your beliefs, changing your mind in the heat of an argument does not diminish you at all. As my freshman year philosophy teacher said, the goal of argument is not to be right, it is to get it right. So be proud of yourself when you change your beliefs in accordance with new evidence even if you technically lost an argument for it to happen. Now, third, if in fact, you've taken the time to understand the other person and they're still wrong, it's almost never because they are evil. It's because they are somehow ignorant. Dialogue can help to lift that ignorance but only if you don't trigger their defense mechanisms by attacking them as people. Now, Trevor summarizes this well on Hot Ones. I don't want to destroy you. I want to engage with you and I think a lot of the time as people. If you have ideas you believe in, you should be willing to engage or you should be willing to test those ideas against somebody that you don't agree with. If you allow these mindsets to sink in, everything from the subcommunications to asking the Socratic questions to the yes-but technique will come much more naturally as you jointly work with the people you're talking to to find solid and true common ground. To be honest, I find that that principle of seeking first to understand is very sparse in the modern media and that's part of why my co-founder, Ben, and I started a podcast. On it, we discuss things like the news and cultural events but really, the podcast is about digging into the hidden psychology and philosophy that drives our lives and all of those events and, of course, hopefully, learning to become better people as a result. The initial feedback on the podcast has been heartwarmingly fantastic so if you are a fan of the channel, I think you could get a ton from the podcast. We get to go deep on ideas that just don't fit here so if you want to check it out, you can click on the page right here to subscribe or listen wherever podcasts are. It is called the Charlie and Ben Podcast — still working on that name. Also, one final announcement — we have had lots of success in partnering with foreign language channels for Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Italian, and other foreign languages and we're actually looking to expand. So if you're interested in becoming a foreign language channel manager for Charisma on Command in dubbing our videos into your native language, running the channel, we are offering 50% of all revenue that the channel managers earn to them some of whom of these people like the Spanish and Russian channels in particular have been able to go full-time even starting teams to run their channel. So if you are capable of the translation and interested in running German, Hindi, Japanese channels or one that I have not yet mentioned, we would love to hear from you and in order to apply, you can just click the link in the description and find out more. Anyways, I hope that you guys enjoyed this video. I hope that you check out the podcast as well and I very much look forward to seeing you in the next video.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 774}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Dave Chappelle may be the funniest man alive. I'm Rick James, enjoy yourself. With three consecutive Grammys to his name, it is safe to say that Chappelle's humor works if not for literally everyone then at least for the vast majority of people. So in this video, we're going to explore what we can learn from Dave's admittedly difficult to imitate style and even though getting to Dave's level might be impossible, there are five core building blocks that anyone can use to immediately become much funnier. One note — we are, of course, covering Dave Chappelle. Some people will find his jokes offensive. I'm going to bleep some of the profanity but you've been warned. So to our first point, Dave regularly plays several different characters. Some of these, he's made famous on The Chappelle Show. Game. Blouses. Dylan. Dylan. Dylan, Dylan, and Dylan because I spit hot fire. Crackhead in the town. Peanut butter and pretzel. He keeps his habit back in the joint. He's always having fun. But even without the benefit of a full costume, you see Chappelle adopt different characters as he tells stories in his stand-up routines. Here, he is talking about meeting Kevin Hart with his son and his son comes across with this voice like an adorable nerd. What's up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don't know if you guys ate but you're welcome to join me if you'd like. And then my son pushed past with some cold shit and goes, Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven't eaten in several hours. Now, we have covered this before but it bears repeating. When you're telling stories, adopting the tone and mannerisms of a character maximizes the value of your punchlines and it even makes the setups funnier. It's an easy principle to adopt and most comedians take advantage of it. Girls get drunk, man, and they don't even know what they're talking about. They think they do. Hey, guess what? You didn't even know where to insert? You're telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be like, Wait a minute. So, obviously, this is something you're going to want to do when you're telling a joke or just trying to be funny but it's not only when he's playing a comedic character that Dave's tone changes. Part of the reason that his normal speaking and storytelling is so captivating is that he doesn't speak in monotone. You can hear him emphasize different words and add different tones when he's speaking just as himself. Stand-up comedy is an incredibly American genre. I don't think any other country could produce this many comedians and unbeknownst to many people in this audience. So, tonight, I am honored that my colleagues are here in comedy and in music. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way. Again, this point may seem obvious but if you've listened to a recording of yourself, chances are you don't have nearly the same dynamics as Dave. Your tone doesn't change and neither does the cadence or volume with which you speak. So one piece of advice to immediately improve any story that you're telling, especially if it's humorous, is to speak as if you were reading a book to a five-year-old. Get into it, let yourself commit, and be silly. Most people overestimate how dynamic they sound so this simple adjustment often will push you in the direction of more engaging storytelling which is critical if you're going to get anyone to laugh. Now, our third point is something every comedian wants and that Dave has perfected over the course of his career — timing. For instance, here's Dave talking about meeting OJ Simpson. Now, these aren't necessarily huge laughs from the audience but notice how Dave gets them without even having to tell a joke. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed to the crowd. Here he was again — the juice. Imagine those simple lines read aloud by most people — someone without good timing. There would be no room for a laugh. But the pregnant pause plus Dave's tones creates that humor and there's no punchline necessary. Similarly, you have this iconic moment that may only make sense if you've seen Sticks and Stones. And in this clip, you can notice how the silence at the moment of maximum tension drives home the punchline. He's talking about Jussie Smollett for those of you who haven't seen the special. Now, comedic timing is a complicated beast and it's interwoven with tone as well as body language so breaking down every application would be impossibly complex. But one simple element of timing that anyone can use to immediately punch up their humor is to leave more space than you're used to in front of the punchline. Most people rush what should be the moment of maximum tension and the highest mystery — essentially neutering it. So adding a bit of extra silence usually makes the delivery hit that much harder. For example, the context of this next joke is about when Dave was an elementary school student watching the Challenger explosion on live television as a schoolboy. Now, this principle of adding silence to create tension will absolutely enhance your jokes but it can also enhance every aspect of your speaking particularly when you're telling stories, allow yourself to slow down at the moment of maximum mystery. This requires you to be strong at commanding attention, something that we cover in the Kevin Hart video that I'm going to link below but you can see a normal application here as Dave builds mystery and takes a brief pause during his acceptance speech for the Mark Twain Award. ...who's charged with keeping the stories of the village. Everyone would tell a griot the stories and they would remember them all so that they could tell future generations. Now, like Dave, you can take these building blocks — character, tone, pregnant pauses — and do a lot with them. And that takes us to our fourth point and probably the most common joke type that I see from Dave Chappelle — the fake-out. It's when he uses his tone to create the expectation of one punchline and then hits you with a completely different one. For example, in this next video, Dave is talking about the tragedies of gun violence in America and how it needs to stop. Watch your own expectations to see how you think he's going to end things compared with how he does. And you know what we have to do. This is a f***ing election year. We got to be serious. Every able-bodied African-American must register for a legal firearm. That is the comedic fake-out. His tone and language took us down one path, he pauses at the moment of maximum tension, and then goes the other way. Here it is again as Dave leads us to believe that he's defending his reputation as a sober professional on stage. ...on TMZ, the big headline, Dave Chappelle drunk on stage in Detroit. Well, if you saw it, I wasn't drunk. I had smoked some reefer with some rappers. And here's one more example for good measure. I live in Ohio, and anyone that knows anything about Ohio knows that even the word Ohio is an old Native American word. It means, literally, a land of poor white people. Now, in labeling these jokes as fake-outs prior to you actually hearing them, I may have killed the humor. But if you've watched the specials, you know these are genuinely surprising and laugh-out-loud funny moments. So learn to do the same. Use your tone to set people up in one direction, pause briefly to build suspense, and then go the other way. It's a comedic staple and one that you can use in just about every situation. And perhaps the best fake-out that you can use in your normal life is to lead in with a serious and literal tone to an obviously silly and false punchline like here. And for context, Dave is defending the art of stand-up comedy from cancel culture — something that we assume he cares deeply and seriously about. It's so true about this genre, when done correctly, that I will fight anybody that gets a true practitioner of this art form's way because I know you're wrong. This is the truth and you are obstructing it. And what I really wanted to say tonight, and I'm glad I get the platform to do it, I'm gay. Obviously, in most conversations, you're not going to go this far but consider the literal to comedic fake-out as something that you can just use more often in normal conversation. For instance, if you're meeting someone in a social environment and they ask you what you do for a living, you can, with a serious tone, make up a silly job like a professional box-ball player and then riff on why it's so stressful in a serious tone. Now, the point here is not to trick anyone. Eventually, you're going to drop that joke and give the real answer so that you can connect on a deeper level but it should introduce a more relaxed and fun vibe to the conversation early on. Now, before I get to the final mindset, I have to highlight just one of Chappelle's joke types which is really hard to imitate well and, I'm going to be honest, I don't have a great tip for integrating it into your own life but it's just worth highlighting. It's the comedic simile and here Dave is using it as he talks about R. Kelly. This guy makes more sex tapes than he does music. He's like the DJ Khaled of sex tapes. Another one. Like, damn! This type of comedy is hard to imitate. To do it in real time, you need quick lateral thinking and, honestly, no single tip is going to take you there in the same way that repeated practice can. So if you want to get the hang of these kinds of jokes... Do you miss the Chappelle show? Yeah. Do you? Yeah, but the Chappelle show is like breaking up with a girl and you still like her but in your mind, like, that is crazy. I'm not going back. You just have to put in the time and the practice. Sorry, I don't have a shortcut for this one. So let's touch on the mindset that pulls all of this together. The reason that most people aren't that funny is because they don't hold humor as a high priority in their interactions. Unconsciously, they think that people connect over things like logistics so they share where they grew up, what they do for work, and how they spend their free time in a very literal fashion. But the truth is, especially in a first impression, even more than the logistical truth of your life, people connect over shared laughter. So allowing yourself to be silly, not literal, all the time, to answer some questions with a tongue-in-cheek response can go a long way like that box ball joke that I mentioned earlier. And in Dave's stand-up, you can see how he prioritizes humor especially in the jokes that relate to hot topic issues. He touches on those issues. In fact, he touches on just about all of them and shares how he's feeling. But rather than drive his point home with a perfectly sound argument, he instead puts the joke in the driver's seat oftentimes ending by teasing himself and dropping any pressure on the audience to conform to his way of thinking. Here, for instance, Dave doubts the claims made in the documentary that was about Michael Jackson's alleged abuse. But rather than make solid points about why he doubts it, he does this. I am what's known on the streets as a victim-blamer. Dang! Michael Jackson was molesting children. Well, what were those kids wearing at the time? I don't think he did it. But you know what? Even if he did do it, you know what I mean? And as we saw earlier, just when you thought he was going to make a grand political point about the importance of voting in the next election, he takes it right back to the joke with that fake-out. You know what we have to do. This is a f***ing election year. We got to be serious. Every able-bodied African-American must register for a legal firearm. The point is, if you want to be the funniest person in the room, it has to become more important than several things that many of us prize, more important than convincing someone of your worldview with every sentence, more important than coming across as perfect. After all, the best joke may be at your own expense. Now, I'm not saying that this is the only way to interact. After all, I've made plenty of videos about how to be persuasive if that's your primary goal. But if you want to be the funniest person, laughter must come first. Now, without a doubt, being funny can be a superpower. We naturally love people who make us laugh. We find them instantly captivating and charismatic. But the truth is, it takes confidence to crack jokes in public, especially with strangers, superiors, or someone that you might be attracted to. It takes confidence to fully express yourself without any hesitation, and most people lack that confidence. And that might be why they're unable to start conversations, make new friends, to get the dates that they would like, or just to comfortably interact with people that they want to connect with. And if you find that you don't consistently have that confidence as much as you would like and you'd like to build it as quickly as possible, I definitely recommend checking out our program, Charisma University. Charisma University is the step-by-step guided program we developed that is guaranteed to make you more confident and charismatic in just 30 days.

I am way more confident now having gone through the daily action guides and I can see a big difference in the attention and respect that I get. I don't think it's an overstatement to say Charisma is literally a gateway to getting anything you want in life so thank you for making Charisma University. This next one comes from a US Army officer. He writes, And this last one is from a guy who used Charisma University to transform his social and dating life and he says, Now this course also comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee that is 100% for any reason whatsoever.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Volodymyr Zelensky has been extremely effective at getting people and nations from around the world to support his cause in the conflict against Putin's Russia. So in this video, we'll break down five leadership habits you can use to command massive respect and make people want to follow you whether you're leading in business, politics, or just your social life. We're also going to touch on Putin's approach in regards to these same habits. Before we start though, the goal here is not to evaluate personalities, politics, or the war itself. It's to help you become a stronger leader using relevant real-world examples. And to the people of Ukraine and Russia, I wish you peace and health and I hope that there's a peaceful resolution very soon. Which brings us to our first point. Do not simply ask people to behave in ways that are good for you. Show them how what's good for you is good for them and they'll follow enthusiastically. This may seem obvious but in high-stress situations, we sometimes expect the other person to care about what's good for us as Zelensky does in this next clip. For context, he and the reporter are discussing why the West won't enforce a no-fly zone and Zelensky implies that the West is not taking into account the Ukrainian people's interest but their own. The rest of the governments, as I understand it, think it will become worse if they involve themselves actively. So it would be worse for whom? For our families? No. For whom? For them? Now, Zelensky's implication is on the money. The West cares primarily for its own interests but when trying to motivate anyone to do anything, do not point out their selfishness or shame them for it. That strategy won't change the fact that people tend to act in their own narrow self-interest and it just makes them defensive. Instead, use the understanding that they will act in their own best interests to guide them towards mutually beneficial actions. Zelensky has done this with his references to a potential domino effect if Ukraine should fall which is a much stronger tactic. To implement this in your own life, take time to review what you know the other person cares about before any important conversations whether you're a teenager asking permission to go out for the night or if you're a CEO asking someone to join your company. Then avoid the words, I want, I need, or I'd love and instead try, you'll get followed by what you know they care about. Fulfill their desires through your plan and you will wind up with emphatic support. Now when speaking to people's interests, your best bet is to approach from two angles. Describe the heaven if they side with you and the hell if they don't. In his Instagram addresses, Zelensky has emphasized this, citing the heaven for those who come to Kiev and help. Then, he belabors the personal cost that will come to those who support Russia. This dual-sided approach is incredibly important for sustaining a position of leadership. If you just use the hell or negative motivation, you will shake someone out of their status quo but you will not guarantee that people actually follow you, just that they change something. It's the heaven or positive motivators that make them specifically move towards your suggested course of action. Putin's approach illustrates this because he has clearly alluded to the hell of nuclear war should the no-fly zone be implemented. But Putin hasn't attempted to describe a positive outcome should the U.S. align more closely with him. The lack of positive motivators has been a hallmark of communication between the U.S. and Putin going both ways and it's why the U.S. has yet to enforce that no-fly zone but hasn't stopped supporting Ukraine in other ways. So in your own life, use both — a great example of quickly hitting on both in a more normal context is Steve Jobs' appeal to John Sculley when he was joining Apple. It's a framework that you can use if you're ever trying to get someone to join your organization. This takes us to the third habit — give your followers a high reputation to live up to even if they've only just begun to earn it. This habit is about seeing the beginnings of positive character traits and calling them out before they have fully developed. It's about catching people doing noble things and highlighting those acts. For instance, Zelensky said the European leaders who came to Kiev demonstrated real leadership and called them courageous even though they were nowhere near his level of risk-taking. When asked about his feelings on the youth of the world rallying around the Ukrainian cause, he said this. Now, another leader might have reasonably said that the performative stances on social media were too small, that more needed to be donated rather than posted about in order to make a genuine impact. But counter-intuitively, people are more likely to take big, helpful steps when they've been praised for small ones, not chastised for them. Putin seems to recognize this as well, praising the bravery of Russian soldiers as citizens prepare for the impact of sanctions. And if it's necessary, how do you protect your own brother from a bullet on the battlefield? In your life, people won't always impress you, though. You will be frustrated with people's effort or results at some point. In these situations, rather than criticize in the heat of the moment, take all your frustrations and speak or write them out. Vent privately. In conversation with them, note any ways that they're living up to a positive reputation and then give clear, direct feedback on what behavior you would like to see changed without criticizing it. Notice how Zelensky does this without getting heated or calling names in regards to citizens sharing details on social media that compromise the military's effectiveness. A close cousin to this is our fourth point, which is when you're praising people, it is much more effective if done publicly. Zelensky has done an excellent job on social media of highlighting those who have helped the Ukrainian cause, from Meda to Elon Musk to the specific Ukrainian soldiers to whom he awards honors at the end of his addresses. This habit makes everyone who sees these addresses want to do more of what it takes to earn those honors and they will work hard to do so. Now, it is true you can get a similar effect by instilling a deep fear of making mistakes in the people around you. The problem with this approach is that you may get a tremendous amount of obedience and effort but you're likely to stifle innovation and discourage people from telling you the truth. We may have seen the tip of that iceberg with Russia's spy chief as he addressed Putin with the demeanor of a man who would be obedient but knew that the quote-unquote wrong answer would not be tolerated. So avoid the short-term motivator of fear and instead stick to public praise, whether it's making a point to call out friends who have been helpful in front of a group or complimenting employees on team Zoom calls. But of course, the most important piece of leadership and the part that truly inspires people is this—your own behavior sets the standard for everyone around you. Zelensky's refusing evacuations, staying in Kiev, and visiting the wounded has done more for morale than all the other points in this video combined. That's because an inevitability of being a leader is that your personal character gets transferred to the organization's culture. It happens more slowly in huge organizations and quickly in small ones but it's an inevitability either way. This is the privilege and responsibility of leadership. Your personality gets magnified. So if you're a leader and there's a trait you'd like to see more of around you like a willingness to self-sacrifice for the greater cause, you need to cultivate that trait in yourself first and you need to show it to your people. You don't have to be on the literal front lines but people must know that your dedication at least matches what you ask from them. When that happens, the bar raises for everyone. Now of course, this last point especially assumes you're already a leader and if you'd like more on how to become a leader whether that's socially or professionally, I highly recommend checking out How to Win Friends and Influence People.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"When most people are asked to picture someone quiet or shy, they picture someone meek — someone who lacks confidence. But that isn't always the case. In fact, you can be quiet while still radiating massive confidence and commanding respect from the people around you. So in this video, we'll go through four tricks you can use to be charismatic without needing to be loud or over-the-top. Let's start with an area many quiet people struggle with — how to grab and hold attention in conversation. This is often difficult for quiet people. You end up talked over by the louder people in the group. For instance, here's a great example of how Will Smith grabs hold of a conversation simply by being the loudest. There's nothing wrong with enthusiastically chiming in if you have something you want to say. But if you're quiet, your voice on its own may not be enough to command the group's attention. Luckily, there's a trick you can steal from Keanu Reeves to make sure you don't get ignored. Watch this next clip and pay attention to Keanu's hands. For context, Jamie Dornan just told Graham Norton about his first childhood acting gig. I'd like to think Joseph asked you again. What? I'm sorry. How old were you? That's tough. No, but he made an adjustment to the dialogue. You were just a man or a boy. Even if you're the quietest person in the room, if you signal with your hands one second before you go to speak, it'll capture attention. Keanu uses a similar trick to maintain attention while he speaks. For example, watch him describe his motorcycle accident in this next clip. Notice how his hand gestures captivate the people around him despite his quiet speaking voice. I ended up sitting on the ground and then that bike was lying over there and then my tooth was cut in half. And I had blood in my mouth. And then the guy came over and he was freaking out but I was in shock so I was like, it's okay. By taking up space with your hands while you speak, you signal that even though you're speaking quietly, you deserve to be heard. There's another trick you can use if you're speaking quietly. If you want to hold someone's attention, hold their eye contact. What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons. She wants to tell the world he's mine. He belongs to me, not you. She marks her man with her lips. Yes, Mad Men is scripted, but this is just as effective in real life. Whether you're flirting or giving a pitch at work, holding eye contact works wonders at conveying confidence and keeping someone engaged. If holding prolonged eye contact makes you nervous, you're in luck. Yes, it's incredibly hard to command respect if you don't make eye contact at all, but looking away at times, either when you're forming thoughts or remembering a story, can actually make your conversation feel more genuine. The key isn't to make unblinking eye contact but to make sure you return to making eye contact once you've figured out what to say. George Clooney is a fantastic person to model for this boomerang style of eye contact. Here's a quick example of it while George is talking about his kids. You know, he goes outside and hugs my car. Car! And he hugs it which is bad when I'm driving. Yeah, that seems dangerous. That's really not good. He gets right in the wheel well. And then my daughter's up in my wife's closet with burses going, mine! The last common mistake most quiet people make when speaking is they take big pauses at the ends of their sentences. This leaves you vulnerable to being cut off not necessarily because people don't respect you but because they think you're done speaking. But it can feel disrespectful all the same. So instead, make sure to take your pauses mid-sentence. This will make it obvious you aren't done speaking and make you a more captivating speaker. For example, listen to Eamon Watson in this next clip. For context, she's discussing the surprising benefit of reading critical Instagram comments. But what I wanted to say was I also got some useful critical feedback that I wouldn't have got — I wouldn't have maybe heard if I hadn't been engaging in that way and engaging in that space. A one-second pause is also a great way to make something funnier. Here's a quick example of Ryan Gosling from The Graham Norton Show. Notice how his habit of pausing makes his story funnier. Was it cellophane you wanted to do sound? My parents came upon a truck of cellophane somehow. I was asked not to ask too many questions. Now, if you're quiet or shy, you may want to radiate confidence or command respect, but you probably don't feel the need to have the spotlight on you at all times the way other needier personalities might. So one nice trick to redirect attention while still being charismatic is to share praise with others. Watch this clip of Chris Hemsworth talking about Thor Ragnarok on Jimmy Kimmel to see what I mean. By the way, I saw the movie last night. This might be the best Marvel movie of all of them. I don't know how they keep doing it. It's unbelievable. I'll tell you how. It was Taika Waititi, our director. He is the director of the movie. He did such a great job with this movie. Yeah. Chris is the title character and a huge reason why the film got such great reviews, yet he instantly redirects the praise to Taika for his directing. This habit is super helpful in any team environment, whether it's sports, group projects, or your job. Some people get this wrong because they mistakenly think the best way to earn respect is to try to take all the credit for everything you're involved in. Ironically, by sharing the praise with others, you earn respect both for your achievement and for your humility. And as a bonus, if the teammates you're praising hear you shared credit with them, they'll like you more. Keanu Reeves is notorious for this. It's not uncommon for an actor to overstate how many of their own stunts they do, but Keanu does the opposite. He's quick to praise his stuntman, even naming him on national television just to help him get recognition. Okay, so I'll do some fight scenes and then John Wick will get hit by a car, and that's Jackson Spiedel. Who's an amazing stuntman. He gets hit by the car. You do quite a lot of your own stunts, don't you? I don't do any stunts, but I do action as much action as I can. Stunt people do stunts. But no, but hang on. I don't get hit by a car. Stunt people get hit by a car. They don't let me get hit by a car. I love that you say that. The key here isn't to duck compliments entirely or downplay your own accomplishments. Keanu admits he does a lot of the action scenes, just not the stunts. So in your own life, acknowledge the compliment with a heartfelt thank you and then redirect the praise to the other people who contributed. That way, it isn't about lowering yourself, it's about elevating others. Now that we've covered some tricks for when you're speaking, let's talk about how to exude confidence even when you're listening, simply by using your body language. Loud people tend to have louder body language with a lot of movement and energy. It's easy to mistakenly think this is the only way to be charismatic, especially because when most people think of someone who's quietly listening, they picture someone sitting stiffly like Michael Cera here. You're one of the people that when I see on the big screen, I wonder to myself, what is their life like off the big screen? No knock to Michael, he was young and has come into his own as he's aged. But contrast that clip with George Clooney here, whose body language isn't big or loud, but it is relaxed and confident. You do hold the whole story together. I do some acting, yes. So tell us about it. Okay, okay. You do the work. Especially when you're sitting while you listen, there's a few specific things you can do to project confidence. Lean back, sit asymmetrically, and take up the unoccupied space around you. You see all three in this next clip with Matthew McConaughey. Notice how it creates a comfortable, confident thin slice. All right, I'll tell you something, Matthew. You know what he told me? What? One take and that's all you really need. There's one more trick you can use to command respect and radiate confidence if you're quiet. And this one is actually probably easier for you because you're naturally quiet. It's being non-reactive. There's a good cinematic example of this in The Witcher when Yennefer is yelling at Geralt and he remains non-reactive. You let the Djinn escape. Who knows what havoc it'll wreak now that it has no vessel at all? No more havoc than you. And Djinns are only dark creatures when they're held captive. How can you be so sure? Kobe's viral moment against Matt Barnes is another great example of how sometimes not reacting is all it takes to look confident. Being non-reactive shows you feel comfortable in your ability to handle whatever is happening. It's hard not to respect someone who keeps their cool in a situation where most people would lose it. That said, you don't have to be stoic to command respect or show confidence. A great example of this was Ryan Gosling's viral reaction at the Oscars in 2017. If you don't remember, his movie La La Land was originally announced as the winner of Best Picture only to have it taken away. The crowd looks horrified. But Ryan is smiling. Listen to him explain why here. I thought someone had been hurt. The way everyone was talking amongst themselves, it felt like someone had a heart attack or worse and it felt like someone was in danger. And then I found out that they just read the wrong name. The ability to laugh or even just quietly smile in a situation where other people might freak out screams of self-confidence. You're basically saying, whatever this is I'm facing, I know I'll be okay. Of course, the goal here isn't to fake that you're okay while freaking out on the inside. It's to cultivate a genuinely strong deep internal confidence. Once you do that, you'll naturally command respect in situations where most people would panic or get nervous. Now the tips in this video should instantly help you project confidence, but building that strong internal confidence does take a bit more time. If you want the fastest way I know of to build that unshakable confidence, check out our program Charisma University. It's a 30-day program that comes with step-by-step daily guides to show you exactly how to build unshakable confidence. And it takes just 30 minutes a day. You'll also learn how to start a conversation with anyone you see, crush small talk, and consistently make an amazing first impression. We've had thousands of people join the program and get a ton out of it. Here are just a few of the things that some past members have said. I had confidence in some areas, but not in others. Then Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. It costs less than half the price of one course at my college, but it has had a far bigger impact on me than any traditional class I've ever enrolled in. This next one is from a guy whose social life improved. He says, It has truly been incredible. I've instantly had results that seem insane. So many more meaningful connections, my friendships have improved, and my interactions with total strangers are a new, exciting, fulfilling thing. I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system. And this last one is from someone who says it's been life-changing. Your course has been life-changing, to the point where I wake up in the mornings feeling like I've been transferred to a new person's body, the person I kept dreaming about becoming before I found Charisma on Command. It is incredible. I've found myself and I've found what makes me happy. You'll see more success stories like these in the comments if you do decide to join the course. And if you join, the course comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. Unlike other online courses, this is not an action-based guarantee, meaning there are no hoops to jump through. You have 60 days, which is enough time to go through the course twice. And if you don't think it was worth every penny, you can just ask for a refund and you'll get it. We do this to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Tom Hanks has one of the most captivating personalities in Hollywood. What's interesting is that his charm has much less to do with what he's saying compared to how he says it. So in this video, we're going to break down four habits that make everything Tom says more interesting and how you can use these to ensure that you are never boring in conversation even if you don't have super interesting topics to talk about. The first thing you can learn from Tom has to do with how he launches into new conversational topics. He usually doesn't just leap into them out of nowhere. Instead, he gives his listener a reason to care and he does so by using a story gap basically hinting at what you can expect without telling you outright. Here's an example. I'll tell you one thing that happens to Tom Hanks, little Tommy Hanks on that trip. Larry's brother? I'll tell you what happens to him. He gets screwed and I'll tell you how. The question, wait, how did he get screwed immediately pops into your head and that is the whole point of a story gap — to raise a burning question in the mind of the listener that makes them intrigued. Now, it's important that the story gaps that you're creating have a mystery with emotional stakes. If Tom had said, you'll never guess how normal my day was, no one would care. So you want to stick with high positive and high negative connotation words when you do this and to be clear, you can be even more subtle and get the same effect of people hanging on every word you say. In the next clips, Tom creates a story gap just by implying that what's coming next is unbelievable or surprising. My brother is an entomologist so this is true. You are a recording artist. Oh, dear. You can use these phrases to instantly make people more interested in what you have to say but the high-order point is that Tom doesn't take his audience's attention for granted. He earns it and it only takes this simple phrase to start with but that isn't where he stops because you can bore people if you don't deliver fast enough when you finally start speaking. So Tom continues to earn his audience's attention by using a technique which is our second main point. He completely inhabits whatever character or action he's talking about. For instance, when he's telling a story about Ron Howard, Tom adopts a different accent, face, and even hand gestures and if the volume were off, you would still see him flip between Tom Hanks and the Ron Howard character as the story continues. Your job is to love the girl. You need to love the girl, all right? That's your job. And I just said, are you gonna fire me because of this? And he said, no, no. Most people stay very flat in their faces when they speak, the same with their gestures and their accent, and it means that they can only be fascinating if the literal words they are saying are fascinating and in this case, they might blame their inability to hold the attention of a group on their life circumstances saying that nothing interesting happens to them. This is only half the story though. The other half is that there's nothing of interest beyond the words particularly visually so don't hinder yourself in that same way. When you allow yourself to inhabit the actions that you were talking about, it doesn't matter if every joke isn't perfect or if the story drags a bit. You're still fun to watch. Take a look at some examples of Tom demonstrating this. ...we have a conversation and that whole build-up to, Hackson! would make the horses go like this and you had to stir them around. Fifty shades of gray. Fifty shades of gray. I don't understand what that means. I have a feeling the problem now is there's an awful lot of spit coffee on people's laps. Are you kidding me?! I think a lot of that stuff. A simple way to practice this is to simply force yourself to pantomime the next time that you're speaking. So if you're talking about running, do the running thing with your arms and if you're talking about playing guitar, the air guitar is your friend. You will be shocked how much livelier conversation becomes and how much easier it is to get a laugh. Now, from everything that you've seen so far, you might assume that Tom is always over the top and huge in his expressions but if you watch this next clip, you'll see something interesting. Tom actually has a mode of conversation that is much quieter and subdued. Everybody says, Hello, I'm Julie. I'm Simon. Hello. Nice to see you. What do you do? I'm the Duchess of Westmoreland. What do you do? Well, I run British Intellectuals. How are you? And everybody's here so kind of like on a first-name basis. Did you meet her? Oh, yes. Oh, yes, indeed. This is a demonstration of dynamics. It's when you shift the size of the gestures or your volume or your tone within a conversation. These shifts can be as big as changing the tone of a story to match a different emotion... Oh, you know, the Tahitian Islands are beautiful to go biking because it's so flat. Nonsense! I don't know what the French word is for that. It is not... ...or these changes can occur within a single sentence when one word is different from the rest. Here's what happens. You're there and every day is just like crazy love boat scandals resort fantastic. Playing with dynamics is important because being fascinating is not just about always being big and boisterous. You see, people notice and pay attention to things that are different from the baseline and being loud and animated when you start a conversation is interesting because it separates you from most other people. But if you keep it up non-stop, at some point, everything that you say is the same and it can become overblown and boring. So shifts from sad to happy when appropriate or loud to soft — these are what get people reinvested in jokes or stories regardless of the content of what you're saying. Here's another example. I always love running into you and seeing you wherever I see you because I always run up and do bits and I just scream at you. That's right. And then your security team... And I just yell your name back at you. When it comes to dynamics in your own life, a good rule of thumb is to come in one level higher than the situation calls for. Like I mentioned, this is going to separate you from others in a positive way. But once you've captured people's attention and a group is listening to your story or what you have to say, don't be afraid to downshift when it makes sense with what you're saying. Great opportunities might be when you're playing a quiet character or shifting the tone of a story for comedic effect. And we said, you guys work here? And they said, every single day. I said, the president's not even here. Why do you have to be here? And they said, in case of nuclear war. In case something happens. The fourth point that Tom demonstrates incredibly well is in his inclusion of multiple members of a group. People naturally pay attention when we feel like what is being said is to us specifically and the simple act of greeting someone can make them feel like the next conversation is for them. So including more people in introductions when you enter a room is a smart move but you can also call an individual out in a positive way or ask them a question. Though this might feel like a diversion from the main topic of conversation, when you go out of your way to include more people in a group, it becomes more interesting because more people feel like the conversation is for them. Another option to do this occurs when you're about to speak on any kind of topic. And you can mention how it relates back to various members of the group. Even if it's not something that directly affects their life, the simple act of acknowledging some relation to them is going to make them pay closer attention. Every interview will be about Forrest Gump at some point. You'll be answering questions about St. Joan for the rest of your life. Now, in larger groups, this may be impractical to do for every single person. So when you're in that larger group and you can't possibly give everyone a personalized reason to listen, eye contact while speaking is huge. We've talked about this in the Tom Holland video but, again, the three-second rule is in effect. To maximally make them feel like you're talking to them, give each person or at least each side of the room roughly three seconds. If you come in a bit under, that's not a deal-breaker. Even a glance can help engage someone quite a bit. Now, we've purposely focused a lot on how to be fascinating independent of the content of what you're saying. It's a fantastic skill but what to say is important too. And if you want to be able to confidently connect with people in a meaningful way so they remember you, you want both. And if you'd like to go deeper on that topic, you might want to check out our flagship course, Charisma University.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Narcissistic, manipulative behavior can wind up destroying your life and it can be tough to spot especially when it's coming from someone you trust. So in this video, you will learn five red flags that someone is doing it to you. You can also use these as signs that you've slipped into narcissistic tendencies so you can cut them out before damaging your relationships. We'll be using Logan Paul's reaction to CoffeeZilla calling out his CryptoZoo project as an example. I'm not going to go into a breakdown of exactly what happened but links are in the description. And after the YouTube backlash, Logan did eventually offer concrete relief to some of the buyers so credit to him for that. One caveat — I am not diagnosing anyone with narcissistic personality disorder. We all engage in narcissistic behavior on occasion. So rather than focus on Logan as totally unique, you'll get the most value if you ask where this behavior might exist in your life. The first red flag to keep an eye out for is morphing criticism. This is when we mischaracterize criticism leveled against us so that we don't have to confront it directly. For instance, this is how Logan characterizes CoffeeZilla's allegations. Where coffee f***ed up is by targeting me as some malicious evil supervillain. Similarly, listen to how he imagines some of his critics see him. Motherf***ers think I'm out here in Puerto Rico with a cork board, tax, string, graphic images going, here's how we're going to scam. This is how I'm going to make my million dollars this time, motherf***er. Neither, though, captures CoffeeZilla's actual criticism of Logan, which was much more specific and limited. Logan Paul specifically got millions of dollars spent on this game on the promise of the technology that he never built, that his team never built. And he never addressed the failure except to blame his developers who weren't paid. As in most cases of morph criticism, Logan has made it more extreme than it really was, talking about supervillains with cork boards. In narcissism, we often make criticism worse because, one, extreme criticism is easier to deflect. Two, we're projecting our own self-judgment out as if it's coming from others — more on that later. And three, because it helps bolster our status as victims and not perpetrators. So if someone keeps responding to straw men of your arguments and not the actual argument, be aware that they may be manipulating you. In those cases, you want to keep an eye out for our second red flag — spending more time on their feelings than yours when you raise a complaint. For instance, watch how rather than talk about what his fans lost, which was a huge portion of CoffeeZilla's criticism, Logan focuses instead on his own losses. I put seven months of my time, energy, effort, all of it — all of it — into this project. And when shit hit the fan, it was devastating. It was heartbreaking. To be clear, it is totally okay to defend yourself and share your feelings when responding to criticism, especially if you take the time to empathize with the feelings of others. That is what George, Logan's co-host on Impulsive, did repeatedly throughout the podcast where he addressed these allegations. Remember, they don't have our lifestyle, so they're working paycheck to paycheck, paycheck to paycheck. So when they go, fuck yeah, Logan's involved in this, I know it's going to win because I've watched this guy win, win, and win, and win, and I want to be like this fucking guy. So I'm going to invest my heart and money. From their point of view, I get your guys' point of view because you're dealing with a legal team, you're dealing with all the people that did you wrong. But from their stance, they go, how dare you go and open up two other projects when I just wasted my hard-earned money on something that I believed you would do. But Logan didn't do this himself. Even the small nods that he made to his audience were quickly related back to his own feelings. I empathize. I totally, totally see why people are frustrated. I'm fucking frustrated. I've been frustrated for over a year. This happens because in narcissism, people experience their feelings as being more important than others. In fact, they struggle to care about the feelings of others at all except to note how those feelings relate back to them. In your own life, you can find out if someone is really listening or just manipulating by asking yourself the question, have they reflected my feelings back to me in a way that makes me feel understood? Or did they merely say they understood and then move on to their own feelings? This is also a great question to ask yourself so that you don't wind up shutting out people that you care about when you're triggered by criticism. Now, if someone tends towards narcissism, when they redirect back to themselves, odds are that they'll exhibit our third red flag — repeatedly insisting on having good intentions without taking any time to reflect on deeper motives. Watch how Logan does it here. My intent was to make the next Pokemon, essentially, you know, on the blockchain. It was purely good. I have the best intentions. I only had the best intentions going in. He can barely muster the admission that maybe CryptoZoo was a money-making play, but only in the way that all businesses are. Was the intent to make money? I mean, I guess maybe eventually, like if you're running a business, I'd assume any intent is to make money off of it. But like in a situation with obviously poor decision-making, if the other person can't identify anything but their own pure motivations, chances are you're being narcissistically manipulated because, of course, all of us carry selfish motivations especially if we started a crypto company during peak crypto mania. The problem is that in narcissism, we can't acknowledge selfish motivations because they would shatter our positive self-image. This is closely tied to our fourth point which is a favorite defense mechanism of narcissism — projecting badness onto those poking at the narcissist's self-image. Projection is a defense mechanism whereby someone puts their own undesirable feelings or traits onto someone else rather than admitting to and dealing with those feelings themselves. In Logan's case, he projects greed and opportunism onto CoffeeZilla. And like many on this platform, you have successfully used my name for views and money. CoffeeZilla, I now know your motives with this — clout and money. Good for you but also you're slimiest. And he's very, very manipulative — very manipulative. Projection is a huge topic that could be its own video entirely so if you'd like more, let me know in the comments. For now, just know that it's very important to have a trusted group of people that will both let you know when someone is projecting onto you and call you out when you inevitably do it to others — we all do. Now, the fifth sign to be aware of is narcissistic rage. It's an undercurrent of anger that boils up when the positive self-image that we've been talking about is threatened in the narcissist. You can see it here. Maybe we could have talked about this if you had reached out to me personally — not my manager, Jeff, who is not me — me, Stephen. The last time on Christmas Eve after the fact was to me. And, of course, it's most obvious in those cases where actual threats are made. I suggest you use the money you got from pumping your Patreon to hire a good lawyer. You're gonna need it. The important thing to realize is that just because someone takes an aggressive tone, that does not mean you were wrong to call them out. In fact, anger in the face of measured criticism is one of the stronger signs of narcissism. It means that you've touched a sore spot and threatened to expose something they don't want exposed, hence the rage as a last-ditch effort to protect the self-image. And this brings us to a very important final point — narcissism, contrary to popular belief, is not excessive self-love. It is a lack of self-love. The narcissist becomes obsessed with their image because it's the most reliable way they have to feel good given how little self-love they actually feel. They need outside validation or power to compensate for the pain of their internal world. Also, the thing that will make you most susceptible to a narcissist manipulation is a lack of self-love. If you don't have self-love, you won't trust your intuition enough and may constantly second-guess if you're just not being charitable enough to a person who is simply manipulating you. That means that the best thing that you can do both to protect yourself from narcissists and to make sure that you don't slip into it yourself is to work on your own self-love. I've said it before but things like breathwork, meditation, therapy, and a whole lot more could be a huge help as well as having a social circle that you trust deeply to guide you when you're most unsure. Now, if you want to work on building that circle with confidence, you might like to check out our course, Charisma University. It is a step-by-step program for making huge strides in your confidence and charisma in less than 30 days, guaranteed.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Timothy Chalamet has two traits you don't often see go hand-in-hand. He's self-admittedly very awkward and yet women find him incredibly attractive. So hot. Timothy, I'm waiting for him to get like a little bit older, you know, like so, so talented. I'm obsessed with Timothy Chalamet. Yeah, yeah, I'm not alone. No, you're not alone. Not at all, no. He's like a lady crack. I just bought a Chalamet and Netflix t-shirt. He's a little dream of a human. This is interesting because Timothy is not your stereotypical jock alpha male in either looks or personality. He's shy and at times seems uncomfortable when speaking, looking down, fidgeting, or putting his hands in his pockets. How can someone who's self-admittedly awkward be so attractive? While he's definitely handsome, much of Timothy's attractiveness comes through in his personality. You can hear it in the way people describe him. He's a dreamboat. He has that kind of energy that draws you in and he's so charismatic. Part of what makes Timothy so magnetic is how well he handles potentially awkward moments. So in this video, we'll go over seven tricks you can learn from Timothy to turn your awkward moments into moments where you're actually making yourself more attractive. The first thing you'll notice in a lot of Timothy's awkward moments is that even when he feels nervous, he radiates positivity. Here's a quick example. When you come out of the gate like this, do you worry about like what you're... Of course, I'm worried. Yeah, right. You do, yeah. His words say he's worried but he's got a big smile and positive energy. By not feeling the need to hide that you're nervous and by having that positive body language, you make yourself attractive. You seem simultaneously genuine and confident. Here's another quick example. For context, in the movie, Call Me By Your Name, Timothy has sex with a peach. It's understandably something he's a bit awkward about. Rather than shrinking into himself, he maintains upbeat positive energy when he talks about it. Once again, laughing as he speaks. There's a scene where... I don't know how to describe this. There's a peach and in life, one has to explore sometimes and the exploration commences. Right, exactly. He's even able to make a joke about it. So people have been mentioning this to you a lot? You say like, are you worried? I'm worried like 50 years from now, I'll be like signing peaches behind a desk. Someone who draws into themselves when embarrassed can make you feel uncomfortable because you mirror their discomfort. But if you react like Timothy does with his positive body language, you actually make it fun to be around you when you're embarrassed. Positivity is a key part of being charismatic. It can even help you recover from one of the most feared social outcomes — being made fun of. Most people dread the possibility of being teased for their awkwardness. This makes them hesitate in social situations, overanalyzing what to say because they're worried about looking bad. But you don't have to fear being teased. In fact, you can come across as attractive after being made fun of. Similar to the first point, the trick is to appear unfazed by smiling or laughing through the tease. Watch this next clip to see a lower energy example. Jimmy Kimmel asks him a question about his GQ cover photo that would make most people feel awkward but Timothy answers with a calm voice and a smile. It's not easy to smile when someone teases you but we'll go through a mindset in about 30 seconds that helps tremendously. First, here's two more quick examples to watch. Notice how Timothy smiles each time he gets teased for what he said. Some people mistakenly think that being teased in front of someone automatically makes you seem unattractive or low status. That's actually not the case. Close friends will often tease each other as a sign of endearment. The mistake that makes you seem unattractive or low status is if you take on defeated body language after being teased such as a frown, a dropped gaze, or a quieter voice. This makes it seem like you think the tease is an actual criticism. That said, you don't want to fake a smile. The goal is to genuinely not take being teased personally. There's an easy trick to this — don't assume negative intent in ambiguous situations. It's tempting to think that someone who teases you wants to hurt your feelings. However, assuming negative intent will only make you feel more wounded and insecure. Eventually, that insecurity will leak out into conversation. We covered this in detail in our video, Five Common Habits That Make People Instantly Dislike You so we'll go through it quickly here. When you read negative intent into ambiguous comments, you leave a bad impression like Brie Larson did in her Viral Wired interview. Would Brie Larson work out? Like, hypothetically, would I at some point? Is that like a personal attack or something or is that a request? Do you think I should? Yeah, I work out a lot. Thanks for asking. If you think of something as a personal attack, it will always feel like a put-down instead of a friendly tease. So how is Timothy able to smile genuinely and interpret teasing as friendly? He believes that nobody cares that much about your flaws. For instance, listen to him discuss the terrible haircut he had to walk around with when shooting The King. Very appropriate for the film. Are you happy it's grown out? Yeah, I'm happy to be done with it and, you know, the big lesson is like nobody cares and that's the lesson of life, I guess, but I don't know. For things of hair, personality, whatever, you think people are — no one cares. Yeah, no one cares. Now that said, there are real bullies and if people are actually bullying you, you don't want to just smile and take it. You want to stand up for yourself. If you want to know more about that topic, we'll link to our video how to stand up for yourself without starting a fight in the description of this video. Now in most awkward situations, simply smiling and laughing will be enough to get you through it but sometimes that feeling of awkwardness gets stuck in your body. You try to repress it or ignore it but it just won't go away so you end up stuck in your head feeling uncomfortable. In those instances, rather than try to ignore your awkwardness, call out the awkwardness. Watch this next clip to see Timothy do this on The Tonight Show. Last time you were here was just right before you got nominated for the Oscar and you went to the Oscars and... That is so weird to hear out loud. I know, me too. Man, I thought this was gonna be easier this time. No. Not easier at all. Really? Are you freaking out right now? No, it's all good. Was that your first talk show or no? That was my first. It was your first appearance. It's counterintuitive but by acknowledging that he feels awkward, he's able to move past feeling awkward. Discomfort grows when everyone feels that something is awkward but no one acknowledges it. The person who does call it an awkward moment gets points for having the confidence to do so. Here's another great example of it. This is from his interview with Ellen talking about Call Me By Your Name. When anybody sees this, you are so sexy in this movie. You really, you really, you are. I mean, yeah, I like... Oh my god, it's gonna be a lot harder to look you in the face now. By calling himself out, he lets the awkwardness move through him so that he can go right back to looking her in the eye. Very few things are actually inherently unattractive or embarrassing. It's your reaction to them that cues other people to think that what happened was bad. We already spoke about one reaction that makes you less attractive which is acting defeated. Another is trying to hide that something awkward happened rather than calling it out and laughing at it. The classic example of this is when you trip and fall. Some people look mortified, others just laugh at themselves. If you act mortified, people will think it was embarrassing. If you laugh, people will think that you're confident because you're not embarrassed by what happened. Watch this next clip to see what I mean. By smiling, laughing, and calling himself out, Timothy seems unfazed. Being unfazed by something that most people would find awkward is attractive. The point isn't to do embarrassing things on purpose but if you say or do something awkward by accident, a charismatic recovery can make you more attractive. Timothy basically spells that out here when reacting to that last clip. Nice recovery, dude. It's all about the recovery. It's all about the recovery. So let's say I was sitting in this chair right now and I was like, No, it's all about the recovery. Now, a lot of this advice will be helpful for people who clam up in awkward situations but there is another camp of people who react to awkwardness by doing the opposite. They talk a mile a minute and non-stop. If you find yourself rambling when you're nervous, the trick for you is to pass the conversational spotlight to the other person. This will buy you time to calm down and it makes sure that you aren't doing all the talking. Here's two quick examples from Timothy when he wants to pass the spotlight. Do you have your like awards that you won? They're all weirdly like they're my moms now and and they're like with all my like childhood taekwondo trophies so it's like a very weird thing. How have you been man? Everything's cool? Oh, no, no, no. You're so nice. You don't have to talk about me. You don't have to talk about me. Armie tells this story better than I do so I'll let him cut me off at a certain point but you know we were rehearsing the villa. We were shot the film where the film takes place and Luca, our director, one day says, Okay, let's do a rehearsal. We're going to go into the backyard. Join us. And so Armie and I were very enthusiastic. We had our scripts and we went in the back in the backyard. The points we've mentioned so far can help you be more attractive early in an interaction but to develop lasting attractiveness, you should do one more thing — share your higher purpose. Truly attractive people have things they care deeply about — grander purposes in life than just being attractive. For example, watch Timothy talk about why he wanted to do the film Beautiful Boy. I do want to be not too serious about this but this is a serious thing like a lot of people and a lot of young people are going through an addiction crisis in this country right now and for whatever reason, there's a bit of trepidation to talk about it and that's what this movie I think hopes to address in some ways. Whatever your ambition is, whether it's in your career or just a hobby, having priorities beyond dating makes you more attractive. Talking about your big goals has another added benefit as well. Because you care so much about it, it's likely to subconsciously give you more conviction and confidence when you speak. For example, listen to Timothy talk about why he felt it was so important to try to normalize gay love stories in cinema. His awkwardness does come through but you can see his vision for the film inspires him to speak with a conviction he doesn't always have. And it's important, man. This is a love story that people need to see. We live in a weird world right now. This is unabashedly uncynical. Yeah, I'm like pitching this movie. I don't know what I'm doing but like seriously, this is a great movie and like it's important to be seen so for any and all that want to see it, it's it. Okay, so we've talked about conversational specifics. Now, let's talk about a mindset that will help you be more confident and attractive when meeting people. If you don't know, Timothy's big break and the movie that made him a sex symbol in many people's eyes was Call Me By Your Name. The movie centers around a romantic relationship he has with his co-star Armie Hammer. It's a bold role to take for Timothy as Ellen lays out here. The commitment and the beautiful way you told this story and especially knowing that you're young and you're straight and you did this, it made me love you even more because that it was a beautiful job. Well, thank you, Ellen. That's like that means the world coming from you. I really mean that. Most young straight actors would have felt awkward taking this role so how was Timothy able to convince himself to do it? Why wasn't he worried? Listen to him explain it in this next clip. And I have the tremendous gift of absolutely nobody knowing who I am so I thought if this doesn't work, then yeah. On to the rest of life. That's it. That's the mindset that will let you approach someone you're attracted to and spark up a conversation without feeling nervous. It's the mindset that frees you from the fear of rejection that creates so many awkward moments. If this doesn't go well, on with the rest of my life. If you think that a particular conversation needs to go well, it puts so much pressure on you to perform. This makes you nervous and likely all your subconscious body language will be stiff and uncomfortable. Ironically, the solution is to give yourself permission to have conversations that don't go well. When you approach someone you're attracted to with the mindset of, I hope we hit it off but if not, well then, on with the rest of life, you will immediately carry yourself with more confidence and present yourself more attractively. Okay, so stepping away from awkwardness for a second, let's discuss a basic framework for what makes someone attractive. This is an oversimplification but it's easiest to think about it as three buckets — what you look like, your charisma, and what they know about your achievements. Different people value each bucket differently but those are the three areas you can work to improve if you want to be more attractive and have a better dating life and there's no denying that Timothee Chalamet's attraction is greatly benefited by that third bucket. He is an incredibly talented movie star. Timothee Chalamet is just like amazing but I think that that's because he's so talented. The good news is if dating is something that's important to you and you want a better dating life, all three of those buckets are improvable to some degree. That said, by far the fastest and easiest one to improve is your charisma. If you want the fastest way to improve your charisma, check out our program, Charisma University. It's literally guaranteed to work in 30 days or you get your money back. It's only 20 to 30 minutes a day and it's structured with a daily action guide so that you know exactly what to do each day to become more charismatic. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below but the best way to learn about the program is probably from the members themselves. So here are just a few of the things that Charisma University members have written in. The first one comes from a guy who says CU helped his dating life. He says, Loving the course. I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation model. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for over a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. I took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we're dating. This next one comes from an officer in the army. They say, Before joining Charisma University, I think I used to come off overly serious and reserved which got in the way of connecting with new people. Since taking the course, I have way more confidence to just go out and strike up a conversation with random people. It's also helped me handle body language and physical contact a lot smoother and in general, I notice people are smiling way more when I'm around. Thank you for making it. I'm glad I joined. And this last one is a comment in the course from someone else who used it mainly to improve their social and dating life and he says, Life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. And there are many more success stories just like those in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all. And it's 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because we want to make sure that every single person truly feels like you're getting a ton of value from the course. Otherwise, you can just refund. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it and I would love for you to do the same.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Matthew McConaughey gives off an almost effortless feeling of being cool, so today we'll break down some of the habits that make him so charismatic and how you can incorporate them into your own life. It's worth noting, while Matthew McConaughey is very handsome, his confidence and charisma can apply to you no matter what you look like. The first habit you can learn from Matthew is to set the mood at the start of every interaction. Matthew moves slowly and is never rushed when speaking. This gives off a relaxed feeling no matter the situation. Just watch how he enters the Colbert show. You'll notice he walks in slow and his pace is very relaxed as he looks around smiling. This conveys a carefree attitude that sets the tone from the start and frames the rest of your conversation. Imagine the difference it would make if he entered quickly and walked straight to the host with tight body language. Now, relaxed isn't the only mood you can set. You can set playful, flirty, high energy, whatever you want. Determine the mood you want for an interaction and spend the first 10 to 20 seconds bringing that energy. You'll also see Matthew greets everyone around him. He takes the time to intentionally acknowledge the band and the audience. Many people make the mistake of only greeting the people they think can benefit them, so you'll see them only try to talk to the most attractive or coolest person in a group. Or, at an interview, they'll blow off whoever's at the front desk, only being kind to the person they think has the power to give them the job. This type of focused charisma makes people feel like you're trying to get something from them, which is off-putting. So, the next time you're walking into an interview, a workplace meeting, or social group, take 3 to 5 seconds to greet each person. For a stronger first impression, combine this with some form of touch, whether it's a hug or just a handshake. Now, it's clear that that trademark energy that Matthew creates is one of comfort and relaxation, so much so that other actors joke they inherit those vibes just from spending time with him. One reason for this is that he makes himself comfortable in every environment. Just look at his body language in this clip from Craig Ferguson. Matthew lounges back in his chair with his arms draped over the side. This exudes that informal, I-don't-give-a- care attitude that is one of the main ingredients of his charm. To try this in your own life, next time you want to look relaxed under pressure, try the simple act of taking up slightly more space than you usually would and opening your body language. A nice bonus to this, your physical comfort will translate to mental comfort, putting you more at ease. So not only will you appear confident and relaxed, you'll also feel it. Beyond just the body language itself, what makes Matthew seem so cool is that he stays anchored to himself. Watch this next clip from The Graham Norton Show. Everyone else on the couch is sitting straight up, but Matthew doesn't try to blend in. He even puts his drink on the ground instead of the table so he can lounge back even more. Many people would feel social pressure to sit up straight to try to fit in, especially around a dominant personality like John Cena. But Matthew does the opposite. He stays in his own frame instead of joining theirs. Staying true to yourself even when it makes you stand out can show tremendous confidence. This isn't to say you should never try to change your habits or grow as a person. It's about choosing what kind of person you want to be. Again, whether that's relaxed, high energy, playful, kind — choose who you want to be and don't stop just to blend in with the other people around you. Now, no matter who you are, there is one more habit you can steal from Matthew to instantly become more charismatic in conversation. Become a magnetic storyteller. Storytelling is a conversational superpower. If you can tell good stories, people will love being around you. And everyone has a fantastic story to tell. In the rest of this video, you'll see that you can turn anything into a fun story, even something as mundane as changing a flight or sending an email. All you have to do is know how to tell it. One key to a magnetic story is using a good pre-frame. This hooks people to listen to what you're saying. Listen to this next clip for a quick example. Just one pre-frame sentence can be enough to hook people. You can also do this simply by hinting that there's a good story to be told. For instance, listen to how Matthew answers George Lopez in this next clip. George just asked him about growing up in an area where being white made him a minority. Notice how he's purposely vague with a smirk and a smile in his eyes that gets George to ask for more detail. Once you have people hooked, there's several tricks to telling a good story. The first is to recognize that people are wired to love emotional journeys. So don't just describe what happened, share your emotional experience during the story. For example, listen to Matthew talk about later that same night when a group of guys approach him and his friend outside the bar. Another trick you saw there to make your stories interesting is to act out your characters. Here's another example from a second later. Let's watch one more quick example. This could have been a complete non-story, but pay attention to how Matthew tells it. He starts with his emotional journey and he ends by acting out his past self. For context, this is about sending his director his vision for the character Dallas in Magic Mike. Now, you may feel intimidated to play the characters in your story. After all, most of us aren't professional actors like Matthew, but you don't need a spot-on impression to captivate people. Any change to your speaking cadence and posture will make your stories more engaging. Listen to the crowd laugh in this next clip when Matthew switches to playing his mom when she's upset to hear they're extending their stay in Greece. When there aren't characters to play, there's another trick you can use to keep people captivated. Tell the story with your hands. By now, you've probably noticed the last trick for magnetic storytelling. If you want to hook people, tell your stories in the present tense. Put them right in your story, experiencing it as it happened. Listen to this quick example where Matthew talks about getting his part in Angels in the Outfield. He pre-frames, speaks in the present, tells it with his hands, and acts out his character — all in less than 30 seconds. There's a lot going on in this video and you may be wondering how do you actually remember all this when you're around other people. Especially if you're speaking with someone who makes you nervous, it's hard to remember to put all this into practice. That's why we put together our program Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program that tells you exactly what to do every day to take what you're learning and turn it into unthinking habit. So 30 days later, you radiate confidence and charisma naturally without even thinking about it. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that our past members have said. This first comment came just one week into the program. While going through first impressions, I've been able to get into conversation with people that I never would have before. The lesson on asking questions to draw out values is gold. Thanks to everyone who developed the course, it has already been life-changing. Another member wrote in, I wasn't truly confident. I was constantly seeking validation and cared too much about other people's opinions. But now my life has improved tremendously because of CU. I find it way easier to connect with people, to have great interactions, and to be happy even if things don't go the way I want them to. Taking this course has been one of the most impactful decisions of my life. I can't recommend it enough. And lastly, one member writes, I am way more confident now having gone through the daily action guides, and I can see a big difference in the attention and respect that I get. It makes life so much more fun. I don't think it's an overstatement to say Charisma is literally a gateway to getting anything you want in life, so thank you for making Charisma University. This program is literally guaranteed to change your life. You can take the entire course, and if you don't think it was worth every penny, you can give yourself a refund from right inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"With the exception of the big one, Avengers Endgame has almost no fight scenes and that's because the core of the drama is the characters' internal struggles. Almost every Avenger begins lacking in confidence and self-esteem then they must go on their own journeys to reclaim those things. Now, not every answer to self-esteem can be found in the movie but it does make a great jumping-off point to discuss five key mindsets that actually raise your self-esteem and confidence as shown through each character's journey. This is going to be different from other breakdowns that I've done in the past that are more behaviorally focused but I hope this one is just as valuable because these mindsets are so core to feeling confident and leading a happy life and I don't often have occasion to talk about them. Obviously, Endgame spoilers ahead. Let's start with the first mindset — failure does not make you unworthy of happiness or love. Now, at the beginning of Endgame, Thor does not believe this and he's a complete wreck because of it. Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy, if you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt! Like many people who might find themselves in a depression, Thor is distracting himself from his pain with alcohol and video games and like many of those people, he knows all the right things to say but can't get himself to feel those things. These things happen, though, you know? Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that— Why don't you come sit down? I'm not done yet. The only thing that is permanent in life is impermanence. Awesome. Thor's problem is in assuming that he can just put the past behind him by distracting himself from it. None of us can do that at least not without serious consequences. In order to properly move forward from trauma, you need to confront how your past still affects your emotional responses in the present but a key to this is to allow yourself to review your past without using the word, should. Instead, focus on understanding why you did what you did because understanding leads to forgiveness and forgiveness is what allows you to learn from the past without staying locked in guilt. That is exactly what Thor's mom explains to him. Do you know what that makes you? Just like everyone else. I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I? Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be, Thor. Thor's should-have mindset is one shared by some of the most ambitious people I know. They should have been better, should have been perfect and the lesson from Thor's mother is the same one that all those people need — who you are supposed to be does not exist except in your head as a mechanism by which you torture yourself so you can't allow the fact that you might have fallen short of some imagined ideal to impact your sense of worthiness. Now, the marker of this is when Thor's hammer returns. ... I'm still worthy. But the point is more applicable in all of our own lives in the previous scene where Thor realizes that he is worthy of forgiveness and of love and so are all of us. I love you, mom. I love you. ... This takes us to the second lesson — self-forgiveness still might not come easily to you especially if you don't have that Freyja figure to offer to you like Thor does so you need to learn to offer yourself at least as much compassion and understanding as you would a dear friend. This is Hawkeye's struggle because like Thor, he failed but even worse, after his failure, he became brutal towards others as a way to express his pain. He fails morally. What I want, you can't give me. ... By the time he comes back to the team, he doesn't think that he even deserves a second chance and when it comes time to someone to die to obtain the Soul Stone, he says as much. I'm trying to save your life, you idiot. Yeah, well, I don't want you to. What's that? Natasha, you know what I've done. You know what I've done. But Natasha reminds him of something that we often forget. I don't judge people on their worst mistakes. Maybe you should. You didn't. Most people are ten times harder and less forgiving of themselves than they would be to a friend. When it comes to that friend, we can see that they're never all bad, they're never beyond redemption but we don't extend ourselves that same level of compassion and understanding preferring to mentally abuse ourselves in a mistaken belief that it's going to make us better in the future. Instead, I recommend that you practice what I call best friend brain meaning that every now and then, when you're in a storm of berating yourself, ask yourself what you would say to your best friend if they were in the same position as you. You'll often find the compassion comes easier when you think of it that way. Now, after you've forgiven yourself, it is critical that you don't then use that as an excuse to continue doing all the same bad behaviors and that is the lesson of Nebula's arc. Though it is healthy to stop focusing on what you should have done in the past, that doesn't mean that you deny your responsibility for what you do now. This is the key tenet of high self-esteem. Now, the Nebula from 2014 doesn't get this and is miserable. She has the possibility of an alternate happier life literally right in front of her but she refuses to admit that she can change and she uses two common defense mechanisms to avoid that responsibility — first, she appeals to her identity. You don't have to do this. I am this. This is the same excuse we often make when we don't want to take responsibility for something. We say, I'm just not that kind of person which may be true but you could become a different person if you put in the effort though that would be difficult and we pretend instead that our identity is fixed as it is. Then, Nebula blames something outside of herself. You can change. He won't let me. Again, this is an incredibly common mindset that holds people back and, of course, Thanos represents a serious obstacle for Nebula to be different but not one that completely takes away her freedom. The same is true in your life. I'm sure that there are strong structural reasons why you can't be the version of yourself you might like to but those do not shut out the possibility and pretending they do only keeps your self-esteem low. In fact, the harder things are in your life, the more your self-esteem will rise when you affirm your responsibility to act in spite of everything holding you back. Now, the older Nebula kills the stuck version of herself but you don't have to be so violent even metaphorically. You can instead engage in a bit of self-dialogue. Listen to the voices in your head that hold you back. Thank them for doing their best to protect you from change and let them know that you can handle it from here. This kind of self-compassion often leads to more confidence and more self-esteem in the long run rather than simply trying to kill off parts of your psyche. Now, this brings us to Captain America and his lesson is that you need to learn a healthy, enlightened selfishness because self-sacrifice for its own sake isn't noble. Cap's decades-long arc begins with a sacrifice — he flies a plane full of bombs into the Arctic saving New York but its deleted endgame scene asks the question we all did at the time. Why did you have to crash the plane anyway? There's bombs on board. Bombs on board. And you couldn't have jumped out of the plane before you crashed it? Now, one reason is that it was convenience of the plot and the writers didn't think about it but there is a reason consistent with Cap's character that works as well. He believes that self-sacrifice is necessary to do good. He thinks he must suffer in order to be a good person. Come on. There are men laying down their lives. I got no right to do any less than them. That's what you don't understand. And that mentality of sacrificing himself becomes his go-to solution even when it doesn't have to be. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play. To lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you? I think I would just cut the wire. Cap's journey is to realize that he can pursue his own happiness while still being a good person. Now, we see this beginning with the decision he makes in Civil War but it stands out the most in his final decision to pursue a life with Peggy in the past. The same is true for you — you can be a good person and practice enlightened selfishness. It's a balancing act and I can't give you a rubric for every situation but to give one concrete example, pursuing your own interests, for instance, pursuing a career path that your friends or family might not approve of is generally a positive way to be selfish. Now, the same goes for who you choose to date or to spend time with. These are not areas where you want to sacrifice in order to please others and when you do stand up for your own desires, your self-esteem inevitably rises. And this brings us finally to Tony. His lesson is a phrase you may have heard me say before in relationship to confidence but it's maybe the most important mindset there is so it bears repeating. Tony's lesson is to have faith that everything will be okay. Now, Tony doesn't start off with this mentality. He rejoins the Avengers full of spite and resentment. He feels betrayed, let down, and regretful. I said we'd lose. You said, we'll do that together too. And guess what, Cap? We lost. You weren't there. But life goes on and the next five years wind up being some of the best he's ever had. Love you tons. I love you 3,000. By the time Tony visits the past, he's learned that fear, nervousness, and despair are usually the result of being too zoomed in — what's going to happen today, this week, or even this year. But when you take the really big picture, he starts to have faith that somehow things will be okay. Now, in other videos, I've discussed a number of different ways to come to the same belief but in Tony's case, it's based on his experience. He has seen the lowest day in the history of the universe and he's seen that there's beauty and possibility even after that. He's seen that his childhood, which he originally thought was lacking... What do you remember about your dad, huh? He was cold. He was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me. ...could be reinterpreted as genuinely positive with the benefit of a wider perspective. I thought my dad was tough on me and now, looking back on it, I just remember the good stuff. So if you've ever had tough times and made it through, which I'm almost positive you have, look to those experiences for faith that things will be okay in the future. At the time, you might not have believed that you were going to make it through that difficult thing but you did and when you recognize and refer back to those moments, you raise your self-esteem and increase your ability to handle today with strength. This feeling crystallizes for Tony when he hears his dad caught in the same zoomed-in concerns he had when he became a father. Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? I literally pieced it together as I went along. I thought about what my dad did and... My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. And despite the fact that Tony's life didn't turn out exactly as he might have wanted it to — it won't for you either, FYI — he gives his dad the most important mindset there is for confidence, the one that gives him the courage to die a hero and at peace. Howard, everything's gonna be all right. If you're interested in the fastest way that I know to build both confidence and charisma, I would recommend checking out our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program that's guaranteed to give you more confidence and charisma in just 30 days and it's structured with a daily action guide so that there's no guesswork when it comes to learning these habits. You just follow the guide and you get the results. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below but I figured the best way to let you know what this is all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written in via email or the course comments. The first one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career and he says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you've taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. Now, this next one comes from another person who started a new job saying, I wanted to let you know that I nailed those first days at work. Everything that I needed was right there at the right moment — the confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset, and all with your tips from last Tuesday in mind — it could just not go wrong. And he finishes by saying, I just wanted to emphasize that what I did the previous days would not even have come to my mind if I had not discovered that charisma is a skill that can be learned thanks to your YouTube channel and university program. And this last one is a comment in the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their social and dating life and he says, Life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. And there are more success stories just like those in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all. And it's 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because I want to make sure that every single person truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course. Otherwise, you can just refund. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead. Click the link on the screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it. I hope that you decide to join if this is an area of your life that you're looking to improve. Either way, you deserve to have high self-esteem. I hope that this video has helped you with that and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 806}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Fans love Sherlock Holmes for his ability to notice things that most people ignore. I was wondering, maybe later, when you're finished... You're wearing lipstick. You weren't wearing lipstick before. I, uh... While Sherlock is a fictional character, there are ways you can learn to read people in real life to better understand what they're thinking and feeling without them saying a word. No individual read will be foolproof, but together, they can start to paint a picture for you, not unlike how Sherlock deduced that John Watson had recently served overseas. Yesterday, I said Afghanistan or Iraq. You haircut the way you hold yourself, says the military. No tan above the wrists. Your lip's really bad when you walk, but you don't ask for a chair when you stand, like you've forgotten about it. It's an actual suntan, Afghanistan or Iraq. Since the goal is to help you be more charismatic, we'll focus on reading someone's interest, comfort level, and emotions. We'll also go over how you can use this to improve your dating life, career, or friendships. While you may never match Sherlock Holmes' detective skills, you can certainly beat him in that. I don't have friends. Let's start with the easiest thing, reading other people's interest. The first place to focus is an obvious one, the direction of their gaze. Most of us do this unconsciously already when we're the ones in conversation. You can tell when someone's interested because they maintain eye contact and you can tell someone is losing interest as their gaze starts to wander. Where most people don't apply this is when they're observing other people interacting. For instance, let's say you're at a party or networking event and you see someone you want to get to know. If you see them looking around a room while somebody talks to them, that's a good sign that they're bored or uncomfortable and would welcome it if you approach their conversation. For an over-the-top example from real life, watch Tom Hardy lose interest while Leo answers this interview question. These men actually did this and within the context of... If this were a social event, that'd be a sign that he's open to a different conversation. The second thing you want to get better at reading is body language. Specifically, when it comes to interest, take note of the direction someone's feet are pointing. We subconsciously want to point our bodies towards people we have interest in but most people have learned not to be obvious if they like someone and so they resist that urge. Almost no one tries to consciously control the direction of their feet which means the feet act like a compass pointing towards people we're interested in. This works for people who are standing as well. If you're standing in a group of people, keep an eye out for where people point their feet and you'll get a clue as to who is more or less interested in you. After engaging someone in conversation, the next thing you'll want to do is read their comfort level. This is useful because some people are too polite to express discomfort but if you can spot it, then you can save a conversation before it goes poorly. Some common signs of discomfort are crossed arms, looking down, fidgeting, or shifting your stance but the sign that most often gets ignored is a rigid body. Here's an exaggerated example from Suits. While we'd all hopefully notice that one, you'd be surprised how often people ignore this sign when it's more subtle. So let's say you're trying to make a sale or you've just put your arm around somebody on a first date. If their body language stiffens and you continue to push forward, you'll likely make a bad impression but if you notice and ease off, then you still have a chance to establish trust and rapport and potentially form a great relationship. The next level of reading someone is learning to read their emotions. Sherlock sometimes goes to unrealistic lengths to read emotions like in this clip where he explains how he knew Irene wasn't faking her crush on him. In real life, emotions can be harder to read than interest or comfort level because it's the area people are most skilled at hiding. So the question is, how do you get a read on someone's emotions when they're actively trying to be unreadable? Three areas that give away key details are the face, throat, and chest. The first thing to look for is a micro-expression on the face. That's an involuntary expression that only lasts for a moment. Sherlock is a master at catching these small changes. Learning how to read every single micro-expression would take serious training but just being aware enough to look for them gives you a leg up on reading people because even if you don't catch what the emotion is, seeing a micro-expression instantly tells you two things. One, something just triggered an emotion so strongly that it wasn't possible to repress it completely. Two, because the person didn't allow the emotion to be expressed, you know it's a reaction that the person wants to hide. For a real-life example, watch Robert Downey Jr. go through a range of micro-expressions in his infamous Channel 4 interview. Notice how because he's promoting a movie, he keeps trying to return to a positive face but he can't hide the other emotions from briefly appearing. I'd really like to ask you about a quote you gave to the New York Times. And I don't want to pry, so if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine, but what you said to the New York Times once was... This was a clue to the interviewer that he's entering sensitive territory. Unfortunately for him, he was not good at reading Robert that day, so he plowed on and started to ask about his time in prison. That question did not go over well and led to the following tense exchange. Watch for two things. First, Robert makes a good read about the interviewer's nervousness based on his leg. And second, Robert's mouth drops when the guy starts to speak again at the end of the clip. We'll come back to this interview again in a minute when we talk about the chest. But first, the second area that gives you information about what someone is feeling is their throat. Specifically, watch for a hard swallow. If you see someone start to swallow their spit more frequently or more noticeably, that is almost always a sign of nerve. This is a very reliable sign of nervousness, and it can also be helpful when you're trying to figure out if someone is lying, although not every hard swallow is a sign of dishonesty. The third area that can cue you into someone's feelings is their chest. If you see someone's breathing shift from their belly to their chest, that is a sign that they're trying to hold in a negative emotion. For example, watch Robert Downey Jr. at the end of this interview as he tries to hold in his anger. You can see his chest starts to rise and fall more noticeably as he gets heated. Unfortunately, the interviewer is so wrapped up in what he's saying that he doesn't read the signs until it's too late and Robert walks out mid-interview. So those are six things specifically you can watch for if you want to get better at reading someone's interest, comfort, and emotions. But there's one last thing that surprises most people. If your goal is to improve your charisma, then the most important person to get good at reading is yourself. Look at me. I'm afraid, John. Afraid. Specifically in areas like social situations or work meetings, pay attention to any time you form a strong positive or negative opinion about someone. For example, let's say you're in conversation and catch yourself thinking, wow, I really like this person. That's your cue to think back to what they just did or said in the few seconds prior and consider if it's something you can do yourself going forward in conversation. That said, if you want a list of charisma best practices so you don't have to rely solely on reading yourself, I highly, highly recommend How to Win Friends and Influence People.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"I just, yeah, I'm good from behind. Today, we are reacting to cringe. So, we've got a number of videos here that we're taking a look at. We're also trying to find out how to save an awkward situation just like that one so you can do it better in your life than I did right there. So, let's dive into these clips. Oh, Duncan. Ooh. If you don't acknowledge the awkwardness of something and you treat the situation that you are in as too serious to deal with the screw-up or to have a laugh, then the entire thing gets more uncomfortable. It makes you more of a laughingstock. He would have been much better served to crack a joke about. I'm pretty sure this is the camera that I'm meant to be looking at right now, but there is a hurricane coming and then roll with it from there. I'm going to walk around and pick you up on another camera, I think. I wish we could start again, but that's all happened live on air. So, we'll start the story again. Ah, this is classic. So, I am here to talk about Need for Speed. So, right here. It's not going great. Let's continue. Payback. If you guys didn't know Need for Speed Payback, I'm... Yeah, it's a great game. But, all right. All set aside, I'm a YouTube creator. Need for Speed Payback is coming out. I got my boy, Marcus, executive producer here. He is the producer of the game. Thank you, Nick, for having me. He doesn't know his name. If you try to power through it and you don't know what you're supposed to say, you are much better off to stand up there and laugh at yourself. You want to lower the filter when you're talking. So many people think that there's only a handful of things that they can say in order to have the conversation work, or in order for the presentation to go as planned. He had the answer in his head, which is, hey guys, this is my first time. I'm completely blanking right now. There was this entire intro, which I'm supposed to give, but I am just going to repeat myself because I forgot what I was supposed to say. But I do know that, at some point, I introduced the executive producer. And, again, that's coming off the top of my head, imagining what he's experiencing, but all of that he knew at the time. And if he'd just been more comfortable enough to sink into the situation, say what was actually occurring and what was going on, introduce him, laugh at himself, the whole thing would have gone better. Identity was really questioned and I think it explores that in a really smart way. That's not real. That's not real. Oh, excuse me. That is not real. No. Talking about the safety of the nation. Did she really do that? In a really smart way. No, that can't be real. It cut, so I can't tell if she tried to move on too quickly. Cracking the joke smart. Really tough to say. Heavenly Father, thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. For the... Oh, God, because joy has come. Not terrible to continue on. He solved the problem. But, again, with all these things, if you just acknowledge it, it goes away. By the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed. Thank you. Good for them. We're so gallantly streaming, and the rocket's red glare. He got it. He handled it very, very well. I mean, that's tough. And they, to be fair, came in and saved him with the singing. But he made himself a likable person just by sitting there smiling, inviting some of the laughter. And, again, acknowledging the situation and not being too big to laugh at yourself when things screw up. When people maintain that serious face as they screw it up, it makes everyone in the audience very uncomfortable. The laughing invites people to help you, which is what you saw here. Sibs, what is your deck name? It flies, you dies. So, so far, I'm only halfway there. It depends on who the you is referring to. That's just a mean edit. It depends who the you is referring to. I'll see myself out. That's the answer right there. Hundreds gather today to say their final goodbyes to this fallen Louisville police officer. D.D. Mega do do. D.D. Mega do do. D.D. Mega do do. D.D. Mega do do. D.D. Mega do do. D.D. Mega do do. D.D. Mega do do. D.D. Mega do do. I get the D.D. a little bit, but mega do do. Yeah, former British serviceman Leslie Bins turned around to save a woman who collapsed while she was on her trek. But he's now attempting to scale the world's highest mountain again. He's going back and joins us now in the studio ahead of his next mission. Good morning. I think you have the wrong guest, sir. I just read the title. You are Todd Landman, aren't you? You look so heroic. I looked at this man and I thought, he doesn't necessarily look like a mountaineer. I think our mountaineer is that man behind us. The worst cringe is when people don't acknowledge the weirdness of what just happened. And they all laughed about it. They cracked a joke that he's not heroic. They've skated through this one quite nicely. You know that well. It's just tough that you have a camera on you. We've all been there. I feel like I see these NBA guys that are going for handshakes and they wind up doing this thing. I think everybody's had a chance where they stick out their hand and the other person doesn't see them. So, I forgive him that. He handled it very well. After the break, we're going to interview Eric Weihenmayer, who climbed the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest. But, he's gay. I mean, he's gay, excuse me, he's blind. So, we'll hear about that coming up. As we head to the break, a look at the six o'clock. I don't know why that's so funny. I've been watching too many of these. There's actually pretty much a 50% chance I'm going to die of cancer. My dad's entire side of his family has died of cancer. Oh my god. I can't breathe. Good for that dude. For stepping up, man. Yeah, so this is where you get that bystander effect thing and every single person is hoping that someone will say something. If you're sitting back praying that somebody else is going to speak when you enter the elevator, or introduce themselves when you haven't met yet at a party among common friends, the best answer is always, to kill the awkwardness in that situation, go first. Open your mouth, introduce yourself to that person. It helps a ton. So, I didn't even see who said it, but good on you, dude. It's Friday, but Tony, the good news is nice and sunny for the weekend. You should come round for a barbie. Hey, thanks. Okay, that's all our news for now. From all of us, have a great weekend. Even you, Bec, and goodnight. I wish I knew the details behind that interaction. If he was just making an errant comment or if she was legitimately asking her out. I wonder if he's married. I'll miss you all too. Wish me luck. Same guy? No, wait. Is this the same dude? The Carlton supporters are very excited. Well, they should be. Yeah, exactly. Ooh! Okay, good. This is going well. You're funny. Alright, now, Melvin, that's what's news this Monday. Enjoy your evening. Now the other one is making more sense why she didn't play along with the barbecue thing because I don't think it was an errant joke. That's good context. So, I hope this video has been helpful in some way to get you out of awkward situations and into a normal interaction or, quite frankly, just have your awkward situation and then move into a semi-less awkward interaction. And coming at you from the future for a second here, one thing that I wanted to mention is if you want to avoid these situations in the first place, you very much might like our course, Charisma University. Charisma University is a 30-day video program that is intended to help you become your most charismatic and confident self in the moments that count the most. And it's the thing that I think is the most effective from taking you from all this charisma stuff being fun theory to actually living it and practicing it unthinkingly in your day-to-day life. The way that it works is it's broken into 30 days and each day has roughly 20 minutes of video plus one action that you will do throughout the day. And that way, by the end of it, you've built up habits and everywhere from how to make an amazing first impression, answering questions like, what do you do or where are you from, to how to be more confident in stressful situations, whether that's at work or talking to someone that you maybe like, all the way through having flowing conversations, body language, leadership, all of this is included in the 30 days. And in terms of building unthinking habits, I think it is very, very well laid out. I'm biased having made it myself but I think it's fantastic. And if you're anything like me, chances are that during lockdown, your social skills might have fallen off a bit. So this can be a fantastic way not just to take it back to where they were but even beyond that so you are your most charismatic and confident self. So if you want to check that course out, you can do so in the link below. It comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which means you can go through the whole thing twice, technically. Decide if you like it and get your money back if it's not for you. So you really don't have anything to lose. I hope that if you're a fan of this channel and you want to take this stuff to the next level, you consider checking it out but either way, I hope that you guys have enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next one. Take care. Peace. You\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 672}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Whether we admit it or not, we've all felt insecure at different points in our lives. And that insecurity can hold you back from things like pursuing your dream job, approaching someone you want to connect with, or just feeling good about yourself. But it doesn't have to be that way. There are tricks you can learn to actually use your insecurities to your advantage, to instantly look more confident, and eventually, to build deep genuine confidence and stop caring so much what other people think about you. That's exactly what we'll be covering today in this video featuring Pete Davidson, someone who has stated many times that he battles with insecurity, yet still has a lot of friends, relationships, and career success. Pete has also mastered the ability to talk about his flaws in a way that makes him seem extremely likable and confident. For a quick example, watch him talk about what it was like being uglier than his ex, Ariana Grande. It's so funny to walk down the street because like dudes are walking by and they're like... Some dude came up to me and was like, Yo, man, you like gave me hope. Common misconception is that being insecure means you think about the things that make you less than perfect. But actually, what makes you insecure is thinking that being less than perfect is a bad thing. If you can accept your imperfections, it'll lead to deep confidence. The first tip to do this is to embrace that you aren't good at everything. Most people try to pretend that they're good at everything and avoid situations where they won't look good. But Pete volunteers to go on What The Fit with Kevin Hart even though he's an out-of-shape asthmatic. Watch how he handles it after having an asthma attack in front of Kevin Hart and at least a dozen other people. Oh, Jesus. Not like this. I can hold this down in here, okay? Kevin, are we still friends? I'm 100% your friend, Pete. Most people would feel shame but Pete can't stop laughing. Just by laughing, he makes are we still friends go from an insecure question to a joke that makes Kevin laugh. The mindset you want to adopt is that nothing is inherently embarrassing. People ping off you to decide if what you said or did is embarrassing or not. Just by smiling and laughing, you convey that you aren't ashamed of whatever's happening. When you know nothing can embarrass you, you release the impulse to worry about what other people think. Here's another quick example. Most people told that they don't have the talent for something would have one of two reactions. They get sad or they get defensive. Watch how Pete reacts instead. You think I could be a good rapper? Oh, my God. No. Is that true? I don't think so either. Laughing shows you're unfazed and being unfazed by something that might offend other people makes you look and feel confident. This only works if you can genuinely find humor in the situation. So how do you start to build the confidence to find humor in situations you potentially feel insecure? One trick to start building confidence is to answer questions honestly in situations where most people would lie. Oftentimes, awkwardness, anxiety, insecurity, they come from you thinking the truth isn't good enough and that you have to lie or pretend things are other than they are. For example, most people when asked by a friend why they do their job will avoid saying money, even if it's clearly a money motivated job because it's not considered an admirable motive. By contrast, watch how Pete responds when asked how he got involved with Mortal Kombat 11. It's my favorite number. Yeah. Also, well, they are paying me to be here to talk about it. Oh, wow. That's really good for being honest. Yeah. No. Yeah. You know, I'm trying to get a helicopter to Coachella. Honesty when someone isn't expecting it is refreshing and will make people like and respect you more. But more importantly, you're training your brain that you don't have to be ashamed of who you are. Pete does this even with more serious issues like his mental health. While most people would try to hide something like having borderline personality disorder, Pete has the exact opposite mindset. I'm sorry. Are you like bragging? So what if I am? So what? I love being mentally ill. I'm so relieved, you know, that everybody knows that. Now I don't have to hide anything. This doesn't mean that you should force your insecurities into conversation. Just be honest if something comes up. Most people create a vicious cycle for themselves. You feel insecure, so you try to hide parts of yourself in order to be liked. This signals to your brain that you aren't good enough as you actually are, which reinforces your feeling of insecurity. One other tip, when you're talking about something you're potentially insecure about, use a nonchalant tone of voice. Watch Pete talk about some cosmetic surgery he got. Any recent purchases? No, I've been chilling. I got new teeth, so I have to chill on getting some sneakers. All right. Just want to let everybody know these are temporaries. I'm aware that they might look a little fake, but that's because the real ones are coming tomorrow. Once you've gotten comfortable with being honest about who you are, you can start to harness your insecurities using self-deprecating jokes. The first and easiest way to do this is to just say your insecurity out loud speaking through a smile. For example, watch Pete talk about being on SNL. So that's good. Five years in, you're happy to be there. Yeah, because like I don't deserve to be there, so like I just— I feel like I'm getting away with something. It really can be that simple. If you want a tip to make sure you get a laugh, use specificity. For example, here's a quick clip of Pete talking about Kanye sticking him with a bill he couldn't really afford. Yeah, you know, why my boy birthday dinner, you know? And then Kanye goes, let's get the special room in the back. He could have just said he didn't have enough money, but listen to how he gets that point across. And I was like, oh, no. So we're sitting in there and I'm like texting my touring agent. I'm like, yo, you got to book more shows. Oh, getting real over here. Here's another quick example. Again, he could have just said his girlfriend is more successful than he is, but listen to how he presents it. You bought a pet? Yeah, we got a pig. You got a pig? Can I just say like this girl, like she was like, I want a pig. And then an hour later, it was just there. You know what I mean? Like I'm still trying to get like a propitious refill. The key here is self-amusement. That's why this comes after embracing who you are. Your goal isn't to make jokes that make other people laugh, but make you feel bad. It's to make yourself laugh. So start with jokes about things you aren't super insecure about and then expand your comfort zone over time as you get used to it. When you're able to genuinely have fun at your own expense, you'll start to free yourself from caring so much what other people think. Ironically, you'll also look more confident and more likable to the people around you. The last habit we'll highlight from Pete today doesn't directly tie into not caring what other people think about you. It's just a generally great habit that makes people love being around you and makes you look confident. That is to raise up the people around you. We all see traits in other people that we envy or admire. A common mistake some people make is to keep that to themselves. They worry that if you highlight the good in others, it'll make you look bad in comparison, so you bite your tongue. By contrast, Pete is very complimentary to the people around him. You know Rob? A little bit, yeah. I think he's one of the greatest actors of our generation. I think he is fantastic. He's incredible and yeah. You can see Rob's face lights up at the compliment. Giving compliments is something that can go really well or very poorly depending on how you do it. So, in the description, we'll link to another video called How To Be Charming In Any Conversation that goes into detail on what makes a good well-received compliment. The mental upside of getting in this habit of complimenting people is you stop viewing the world as a competition and when you build the habit of seeing and saying the good in other people, you'll have an easier time seeing the good in yourself. If the idea of giving someone a direct compliment like that makes you uncomfortable, you can start by complimenting people when they aren't around. This is something Pete regularly does. Here are a few examples of him talking about his friends. My boy birthday dinner. That's nice. You know, because he's like the greatest. He's the best musician that's ever lived and yeah. One thing no one knows about Coulson is, well, I think people are starting to know, but he's really f***ing hilarious and like genuinely one of the nicest people I've ever met. I just want to say like Kim and Kanye, the cutest couple ever, very, very sweet people and like I had a really good time with them. Yeah, they're great, yeah. Don't say it if you don't mean it. You've probably noticed by now, but an overarching theme in this video is the power of being authentic and dropping your verbal filter. So your goal isn't to force yourself to say something nice you aren't thinking. It's to say out loud whenever you are thinking something nice.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, you'll learn six habits that will make people love being around you, with examples from a celebrity that is almost universally loved, Ryan Gosling. Most people go into conversation wanting to be liked. This can massively backfire if done wrong, making you look needy and insecure. So instead of going into a conversation thinking, I hope they like me, go into it with the intention to have fun. This mindset shift can completely change your social life. If you want a specific technique to make conversation more fun, play around with absurd analogies. Here's an example from Ryan talking about a dog he rescued while filming Nice Guys. You might think this is hard to do, but it's actually easier than it looks. For instance, in this next clip, Ryan is embarrassed by a dish towel covered in pictures of his face. He doesn't want to look at it. What's the first analogy that comes to your mind when you think of something that hurts to look at for too long? One trick to get the biggest laugh possible is the mind's eye method. Create a ridiculous mental image in the person's mind. For example, listen to how Ryan describes Emma Stone's reaction after being lifted over his head for a dance scene in their movie Crazy Stupid Love. If you're on the quieter side, there's another easy way you can use absurdity to make your conversations fun. Deadpan humor. The danger of deadpan humor is if people don't get that you're joking, it can create awkwardness. So a good general rule with deadpan delivery is to be absurd enough to make it obvious that you're joking based just on your words. You saw there that even though Ryan starts out deadpan, he'll often transition to showing a smirk or a smile to let people in on the joke. Smirking or smiling makes it easier for people to recognize that you're being playful. It lets you do stuff like this next clip and get a laugh. That's another easy, low-effort way to get a laugh. A fake walk-off. Ryan loves this joke and uses it repeatedly. Now, being fun is a great start to a conversation, but it won't automatically make people admire you. One reason Ryan is so admired is because he's a good-looking famous actor. That's tough for the rest of us to copy. But Ryan is also admired for his confidence, and that is something we can all massively improve if we train it the right way. This might seem counterintuitive, but one of the best ways to both look and feel more confident is by telling funny, embarrassing stories from your past. You look confident because you're willing to share parts of yourself that many people would try to hide. And you feel more confident because you start to internalize that you don't have to be perfect for people to like you. As an example of this, listen to Ryan lean into the embarrassment after Graham Norton shows a video of him in a dance contest as a kid. You probably noticed there, when you emphasize that you're aware it was embarrassing, that's what invites people to laugh with you. The best embarrassing stories are light-hearted, cringey moments from the past, stories where no one is deeply harmed, and the laugh comes at your expense. Once you find a story you like, you can make this a go-to story that you use frequently with new people. Most great storytellers have these go-to stories. Here's one of Ryan's about a massage gone wrong. This guy's idea of massage was to like take my one leg and the other arm and try and connect it behind my back. And he's trying to connect them like this, and I'm in such pain I go like that. And then I, well his belly went in my mouth. You know how when you eat something weird, your brain sends your tongue to investigate? It's not a conscious thought, it's just like, is that a bone? Figure that out. Your tongue goes in to figure it out. Handling embarrassment from the past is easy. After all, you've grown and changed, you're no longer that same person. But how do you handle embarrassment the moment it happens? Most people try to pretend the awkward moment isn't happening, but you can actually display confidence if you call attention to your awkward moments and laugh at them. I have to admit something. Oh, uh, yeah, okay. I didn't try this suit on before I came out. And I realized that it's, it's so tight. So next time you catch yourself making a small mistake in conversation, invite people to laugh with you by calling it out. Ryan's frequent co-star Emma Stone has the same habit. In this next clip, listen to how she saves a bad story after realizing she's sharing unnecessary details. So I had a cast and all that, you know, I was just, it was miserable. Um, it was the day before the last day of school. Anyway, I had internalized this. It's an important detail. Calling yourself out with a smile can turn a boring or awkward moment into a moment where everyone is laughing. Sharing embarrassing stories and calling out awkward moments also helps create authenticity in your conversations. When you and the person you're talking to feel that the other one is being authentic. That is what creates a deep connection. You've done a little on your end already with the advice in this video. And you can also do this with how you react to the other person. For example, watch how Ryan creates a more authentic conversation by gently calling out this reporter for how she describes his co-star. But your daughter, what was it like working alongside her? She's just a star in the making. Yeah. You said it that because you didn't know how to pronounce her name. I don't, it's Angourie Rice. Angourie. Angourie Rice. And they say it so well. I read that I have similar fear in my eyes too. This doesn't mean you need to be the authenticity police and call it out all the time. In fact, an easier way to create authenticity in a conversation is to compliment it when you do see it. For an example, watch Ryan in this interview for his movie Blade Runner 2049. Notice how he reacts when the interviewer says something most people wouldn't have shared. Because these were from the original Blade Runner. This is what they used. So I thought, you know, attention to details for fans will probably like that. That's so cool that you did that. Are you a fan of the originals? Never seen it. I appreciate your candid. Complimenting authenticity is a great way to encourage more of it. It'll also make people feel good around you. Too often, people think of conversation simply as an exchange of information. A huge part of someone wanting to see you again is their emotional experience when they're around you. An important caveat here, do not be fake. But if you see something in someone that you genuinely admire, tell them. Show that you like who they are. If you're worried this will make you seem like a suck-up, you can mix some good-natured teasing into the same conversation. Here's an example from Ryan a minute later in that last clip. For more light-hearted compliments, you can combine the compliment with a joke. Ryan does this in this next clip, complimenting Conan on his iconic string dance. One important note here, truly charismatic people make everyone feel good about themselves, not just people they are trying to impress. So take time to acknowledge and appreciate everyone, especially the people who normally get ignored. For instance, most guests on a talk show just walk in, greet the host, and start promoting their project. But watch what Ryan does. If you build this habit, it's very likely that some people will reciprocate and start complimenting you. One charismatic way to respond is to be playfully humble. Don't respond like this to every compliment, but mixing in some playful humility along with genuinely appreciating compliments is a powerful combination. Now obviously, Ryan isn't thinking about all of this while he's in conversation. He does it without thinking. That's your ultimate goal too, to be charismatic effortlessly, without even trying. One way to do that is to build these habits one at a time. So you pick just one thing you like from this video and make it a point to try it in your next conversation. Stick with that one charismatic habit until it's something you do naturally, then move on to another. The second, faster way to do this without thinking is to internalize the confident mindsets that naturally create charisma. One of those confident mindsets that you can learn from Ryan is self-validation. You don't get the sense from watching Ryan that his main goal is to get the approval of other people. No moment captures that better than his reaction at the Oscars after his movie La La Land was initially announced for Best Picture, only to have it taken away and given to the real winner, Moonlight. The actors in the audience should be much less invested in this award than Ryan, since he's the one in the movie, but look at their reaction compared to his. This viral moment was something many people found extremely admirable. In a situation where most people would be upset, he's totally unfazed and can even find humor in it. This calm-centered, light-hearted attitude is something that draws people to you. Listen to Ryan explain how he's able to stay so cool and calm in that moment. Ryan maintains perspective. He realizes that, at the end of the day, the Oscar is a little 13-inch trophy. It's not life or death. Now, you probably aren't an actor going up for an Oscar, so what can you learn from this to carry yourself with unshakeable confidence in your own life? So much of confidence is simply internalizing that the stakes aren't that high. People see someone they're attracted to, and they freeze up, heart racing, breath quickening, unable to muster the courage to say anything. Or you have an interview, date, presentation, whatever, and you don't present yourself well because you're too nervous to be your best self. It is a superpower to go into a conversation and really feel that you don't need anything from it. Sure, you'd like the job, the date, whatever it might be, and that's okay. Want it, don't need it. You'll have other opportunities, and no matter what happens, you'll be okay. If you can internalize that belief, suddenly you radiate confidence without even trying. Suddenly things just come easy to you, and you're making incredible impressions wherever you go. You might think building this type of deep confidence will take you a long time, or maybe you think it's impossible for you, that you could never actually feel this way. But building deep, unshakeable confidence is way easier than you think. With the right game plan, you can become significantly more confident in just a few weeks. If you want the fastest way I know to take your confidence and charisma to the next level, you may like our 30-day video program, Charisma University. Just listen to some of the things our past members have said. I had confidence in some areas but not in others. Then Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. I wasn't truly confident. I was constantly seeking validation and cared too much about other people's opinions. But now my life has improved tremendously because of CU. I find it way easier to connect with people, to have great interactions, and to be happy even if things don't go the way I wanted them to. Taking this course has been one of the most impactful decisions of my life. I can't recommend it enough. Thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values, and I know who I am. We guarantee Charisma University will change your life. That means you can take the entire course, and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can refund yourself from right inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"When you're trying to change your life, it's likely that your beliefs are the biggest obstacle that you face. You can change your habits, you change your behaviors, but no matter what, it can be like there's an autopilot pulling you in the opposite direction. Now this was actually a question that came up on our podcast from someone who didn't want to be chasing money and prestige but found themselves pulled towards those things even though they weren't making them happy and I thought that the answer might be useful to you here. Now this is actually a clip from the podcast as I mentioned and if you enjoy these on the main channel, you can let me know and if you don't, let me know in the comments as well. Either way, here you go. So Ashley asks, how does one overcome cognitive dissonance and value systems? Ayahuasca, no. Well, continue, sorry. If you value something such as prestige, money, etc. but you know you shouldn't, how do you change that? This is hard and this is such a good question. Maybe you realize, for those who haven't asked this question, this is one of the most important questions you can ask which is how do I stop valuing the things that make me unhappy because that's it, right? If you could orient yourself towards the things that you have statistical experiential data that will actually improve the quality of your life and your joy and your happiness, it's easy. The problem is we still want to be famous and beautiful and well-liked and have a ton of Instagram followers. So how do you do this? I have had some success but not complete with this and I'll share you the things that have helped. One is to treat it like an addiction in that alcoholics don't hang out in bars if they're smart and people who seek validation don't hang out on Instagram if they're smart. They don't go to the places and they don't hang out in the environments that trigger it and what I can say is, you know, having gotten off of this stuff — And validation, I would count prestige in there which is your question. I like prestige. Prestige is about the perception of other people. Prestige is not really about your accomplishments. If you continue to accomplish great things in your career and in your philanthropic efforts but you just don't brag about them on social media, you're now just doing good stuff. You're no longer trying to chase the prestige. So what I've seen and then this is true of addiction as well, there's a massive difference between zero and one. Zero drinks and one drink are not the same thing and so five minutes a day of Instagram and zero minutes of a day of Instagram are very, very different in terms of how your brain gets wired. So I would advise you to find the things that trigger these values that you'd like to shift, whatever they are, whether they're people, whether it's a place, an app, a job that you may have, and cut it to zero. What if it's friends? What if you have a friend group that's very prestige-hungry and it's constantly asking you how much you make? Yeah. Oh, did you get the promotion or what firm did you work at? Oh, you got that firm. That's crazy. That's so good. Yeah. What do you do now because they're your friends? So I have — well, I think you might have an answer. No, I don't. So what we did — I was really lucky. One person makes all the difference. Human beings need social validation to feel like they're not schizophrenic and crazy. Yeah, they're not insane. So having been when I started my business while everyone else told me I was crazy and I wasn't going to do it and this is a waste of my time, I felt not crazy at all. We kind of — because we had each other — got to know you guys are the crazy ones. You're the crazy ones. You don't get it because I had a ton of friends — I still do — of super high-paying prestigious jobs in finance on Wall Street and they were all like, you're going to leave to go to Brazil to start a business that does what? But I got to go to you. I got to go to these people who don't get it. But if I was by myself, I think it would have been a lot of pressure that would have eventually folded me. So seek out and find at least one individual. And in order to do that, you have to speak up. So I had to give all these books that I like to all of my friends and saw who took to them and they didn't all. And Ben had to get the 4-Hour Workweek. Get 90% of people. Ben had to give the 4-Hour Workweek to a bunch of people and they didn't care. Luckily, we were best friends and we both happened to seize upon this book that put us down a different path. So that was one. If you can get just one person and then, man, make that your home base and build from there. It will grow because then you'll be wearing on your sleeve whatever you do. So you're trying not to care about prestige but you will care about something, right? Maybe it's helping people and not posting about it. You will find a place to volunteer and the people there will be volunteers. And some of them will be doing it for the Instagram likes and you'll avoid those people. But you'll meet other – by doing what you actually want to be doing, you'll meet other people that have those values. Yeah. And then so that's the one that has really worked the best. When I look at the things in my life that are the most stubborn changes, it's that. Other things are these massive intervention experiences. So I don't just mean ayahuasca, which we talked about, but I also mean I've gone to a personal development program, Weekend Things, where they get you for 40 hours over the course of the weekend and they beat you down and you break at some point and something shifts inside of you. It doesn't make all the change but those have been valuable. I know that some people say that about Landmark. I would recommend books actually. Dude, I was as prestige-hungry as you get. So I was a nerdy kid growing up, wasn't good looking or good at sports. So I just went, okay, well, what's going to get me any sort of pat on the back is grades. Suddenly, I wanted to go to whatever was the best school I could get into. It's all I cared about, right? I wanted to go to California so bad, but I ended up going to Philadelphia. It's a ridiculous decision. And then I did not want to go into investment banking when I was a sophomore. I ended up in investment banking because it's what all my fraternity brothers were patting each other on the back for. And so what firm did I go to? I went to the most prestigious one. I was very prestige-hungry and I read a book and it completely changed my paradigm. So I think reading alternative paradigms, reading things written by people who don't have the values that you want to avoid, that can actually be some of the most life-changing stuff. Because weirdly enough, I was that to a T until I was 22. You know what I mean? Couldn't find someone more prestige-hungry. I didn't want the money. I just wanted the validation and the pats on the back. Sure. And the last thing that I'll say, and this one has worked, this works for the ones that aren't the deepest in you but are like mid-level things that are stuck in you, is a video we have called How to Stop Self-Sabotage, I believe. And it has an exercise in there where you go and you do free association to pull out whatever associations you have to prestige or to money. And what you'll realize is some of the roots of these, not every time, but you can get in there. And that helped me with actually limitations around earning money. I put the brakes on our business for a long time because I thought that earning more money would make me unhappy because I lived in New York City and I was seeing all of these rich, unhappy people. And it was only when I did this exercise that's in How to Stop Self-Sabotage that I saw that and went, oh my gosh, this doesn't line up, and I could start to unravel that. So that long answer, but these are a handful of places to start. It's tough though. It's a great question. It's THE question. It's THE question. I've kept my worst one. I think most people have so you're safe and in good company. Just like today. So I hope that you enjoyed that short clip. If you liked it, you want to see the podcast in its entirety, the link is in the description. Now Ben and I have been doing this for roughly 20 episodes and on the podcast, we cover everything from psychology, philosophy, sometimes politics, and we touch on current events but mostly to get into the psychology, philosophy, and politics. If you guys are interested in that, like I said, link in the description. We didn't want to share this on the main channel before it was ready and that's why we shot 20 episodes but based on the feedback that we're getting in the comments, some of the reviews that we've gotten, I feel like it is ready to share with you guys which is why I wanted to give you this little sneak peek. So if you liked what you saw and you want to see more, go ahead and check it out. I have been having a great time with it and there's this added bonus that we actually take calls from people who want to talk to us so we'll answer questions about charisma. If you want to chat, if you want to debate with us, you can do so on the podcast. And in order to do that, just go to the most recent podcast that we find. You can find it on the channel, whatever it is. Click the link in the description. There'll be a link there that says that you can call in and we will call you and we'll have a little chat if you're interested. So I hope that you decide to check out the podcast. Let me know if you want more clips related to charisma on this main channel on the off days or if you don't and we won't do it anymore. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Today, we are talking about self-doubt. It's that particular kind of self-doubt that gets in your head maybe when you've gotten a promotion or you just started dating someone that you feel like is a bit out of your league and it says, you don't deserve this, you shouldn't be here. It is called imposter syndrome and unfortunately, what it does is it can make you self-sabotage that thing that you just got so you fall back to where you feel comfortable even though, in fact, you were deserving of what you had. So we want to work on conquering it, crushing it once and for all and there is a mindset that does that no problem but before I get to it, I have to say, if you suffer from imposter syndrome, thank you. Thank you so much. I think and truly, I feel that we live in a world that needs more imposter syndrome because it is full of imposters and you might have seen some in the YouTube ads coming on here people that are promising you that they can teach you how to get rich and some of them, not saying all of them, if you dig into it, you see that they haven't gotten rich the way that they are proposing you do. They are trying to get rich by having a business that teaches other people to get rich. We need to be skeptical of our own skill set. We need to not overstate what it is that we do. So if you have that healthy dose of skepticism, you're not sure if you're an imposter, great. I'm going to help you find out in a way that exposes that and also gets those of you who really do need and can step up to do so. So the mindset is this — when you're being promoted, when someone is dating you, if you're thinking of putting a video on YouTube to share some expertise or some knowledge that you have, the world, your boss, the person that's dating you, isn't expecting you to necessarily be the best in the world. We're not even expecting you to be a quote-unquote expert. We're expecting you to help to improve something in the way that you say that you can. And if you do that, you're not an imposter. It's that simple. We're lowering the bar from having to be perfect, best in the world to can I help in the way that I promise that I can. That's it. Now, this has three concrete ways that it's going to change your behavior. First off, you will not overstate what you can do going on. Now, I know a lot of people when they're trying to get promoted, they get this promotion, the boss says, okay, we're going to task you with this task, can you handle it? And it's one they can so they go, yep, I got it. He says, awesome, since you've got that, how about this other thing? And this other thing you sense is not just a stretch for you, you can't do it without mentorship, you're not ready but you want to please them and you say, I've got it. Now, you've fallen into imposter syndrome. Much better is to draw a line around your current abilities and say, look, here's what I can do, here's what I can't yet to do. Now, I could learn this but I don't want to overpromise. And there were times that this happened in my own career, right? When I was doing coaching back when I taught people charisma, I felt comfortable, I'd studied it for years and years and years. But I had one client who was a manager of several people at a large company. So he comes in and he's looking for managerial advice because he thinks that falls under the umbrella. If I start telling him about the newest management trend and all the things he can do for his compensation packages, I'm in out of my depth. I'm going to mess up, he's going to know it, and now I'm an imposter. So what I said instead was, look, I can't help you there. That's not my area of expertise, I've never done anything like that. What I can help you with, and this is good, not just what you can't do, what I can do is focus on the underlying psychology. We can talk about basic human incentives so I can't help build the compensation package but I can help you understand who might need a bit more praise, who might be someone that would shine a little bit more if you would give them the opportunity. So that is what we did and it went well. So that's the first thing, draw a boundary over what you can and you can't do today. The second thing is going to be to take an honest stock of your past and to write it out. Can you help in the particular situation that you are in? One of the things that happened when I first started sharing videos and posts is I would put them on Reddit. And Reddit can be brutal, it's honestly awesome for honest feedback. So what I would get are all these comments and there'd be a lot of really nice ones and then it mixed in there one or two that were like, this is trash, I knew this, I don't need this. And I would spend 80% of my energy focusing on responding to these people, taking down every point they said one by one and addressing it such that 80% of my thoughts got to the point where I'm not very good at this because that's where I was spending most of my time. What was incredibly helpful was just looking at it from top to bottom and going, okay, I'm going to, like an analyst, count the number of people who voted up the thing that said this was spectacular. Okay, there were 30. Okay, let's look at the person who said this is terrible. There were no upvotes. Can I then make a reasonable assumption that this is helping and it changed the way that I felt about my own work, it made me put it out there more, and I think, ultimately, helped more people. So go through your own track record and write down, this was a win, this was a loss, this was a time that somebody said I did well, this wasn't. And if you want to, even ask people around you for honest, candid feedback. It goes a long way towards telling you where you are. And the third thing is this — we're all trying to grow our skills but there's really two main ways that people do it. Some people shoot for credentials. When they're training, they want to be some sort of an athletic trainer, they go for the certified by yada, yada, yada, and they get that rubber stamp over the weekend. And then there's the person who wants to be a trainer and says, you know what, that rubber stamp is nice, maybe I learned something, but what's important is can I deliver results for my clients. So let me take three of my friends, train them for free, and see if in four months, I can make a visible massive difference in their life. I would propose to you that that second person is a better qualified coach than the person with credentials assuming that they can't do what they can because people don't want you to have something on your wall that says, They want you to change their life in a positive way. So when you're looking for opportunities to grow and you don't want to be an imposter, focus on creating results for the people around you whether that means working for cheap, for free, or if you're already getting paid, doing it for clients, and really focusing on what it is that you can do to improve their life. That is going to take you out of the imposter camp and into someone who is truly making a positive impact. So I hope that this has helped you. For those of you who are maybe standing there going, you know what, I might be an imposter, good. Grow in that new direction and for those of you who are feeling like I need to step up, I hope you do so. Either way, I have an exciting announcement for everyone which is that we just started a podcast channel. Now, we do discuss charisma themes on there some of the time but it's for Ben and I to kind of just share the things that we are most interested in. I find it fascinating. If you are interested in what we're doing outside of this particular channel, I recommend that you check it out. We'll have a link here on screen and in the description as well. So, I hope that you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 395}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Like it or not, we have all been awkward at different points in our lives and sometimes, that awkwardness gets in the way of connecting with other people or even just feeling confident in ourselves but awkwardness doesn't have to be the end of the line. In fact, if you handle yourself well, you can turn awkwardness whether it's just a moment or a way of being into confidence which is what we are covering in this video featuring Tom Holland. Now, I'm not saying that Tom Holland is an awkward guy always. I'm saying that he is very skilled at turning those more difficult moments around. So first off, you can improve both your self-confidence and other people's perception of you in nearly every situation simply by adjusting your body language. For instance, Tom is able to convey a sense of comfort and ease while he speaks by following the three-second rule of eye contact and shifting his gaze to various people. ...and you have to go through an exam process to get into this school which obviously I didn't do and she's like, hey man, what's your deal? How are you here? I was like, well, let me tell you my secret — I'm actually Spider-Man. The three-second rule of eye contact says that instead of looking down or away or awkwardly staring at someone for way too long, give everyone in a group at least three seconds of eye contact before moving to the next individual. Now, of course, this number isn't exact every single time but it's the amount of time that generally makes someone feel included in a conversation. If you're listening to someone speak, more continuous eye contact is totally appropriate since there's one person speaking but the three-second rule is an easy way to capture an audience even if you're a bit nervous while speaking. You'll also notice that Tom tends to show his palms and gesticulate frequently while he speaks. ...go through an exam process to get into this school which obviously I didn't do. It was like a couple hundred thousand. Oh, that's a lot, yeah. I was like, this is amazing. Not only do his gestures make his comments more intriguing to listen to but in revealing his palms specifically, he avoids a trap that awkward and nervous people fall into all the time — when you hide your palms, it sends a subconscious signal to the other person that you may be keeping something from them and that can result in making you come across as less trustworthy. So get your hands out of your pockets especially when things get uncomfortable and don't grip the podium if you're giving a speech or a chair if you are seated. Reveal your palms and you will immediately come across more confidently and more trustworthy. Now, the overarching rule that you can see in all of Tom's body language that is excellent for any time you're put into a difficult or awkward situation — be that karaoke, dancing, or even just giving a speech — is commitment. Check out Tom's rendition of Rihanna's Umbrella. Dressing up like Rihanna and dancing provocatively would make most men freeze and become extremely rigid. It's that fear of being judged or criticized that causes them to subconsciously limit their range of motion and even facial expressions so as to draw less attention to themselves. Unfortunately, it's exactly that limited expression that signals discomfort and creates an awkward experience for everyone present and especially the people watching you. But by committing fully from his dance moves to his facial expressions, a scenario that could go terribly becomes one where Tom's confidence shines through and you see the same principle at play with Jack Black. I've just been watching the show backstage and everyone has such good moves. I was feeling the pressure and I was like, I gotta bust out some moves on the way down there so I don't really have the moves. No, you do. I thought I'd make up for it with just like commitment. So if you do something goofy whether it's on purpose or by accident, your best bet is to go all the way. Paradoxically, by embracing awkward situations fully, you show more confidence than every other person on the sidelines which brings us to the times when awkwardness is forced on you. For instance, when friends are teasing you. Now, in the past, we've covered how to handle more malicious attempts to make you look bad so you can check out our Russell Brand or Robert Downey Jr. videos to see what to do in those cases. But it is very likely that especially if you're a guy, your friends are going to tease you and it's not necessarily out of malice. If you handle these situations poorly, you can become the forever butt of the joke. Handle them well and you can exude confidence and become a leader in your group. So in those situations where the teasing isn't in bad faith, a great first step is to just take up more space. It's their time. I didn't know your name was Tom. I'll put my thigh next to his thigh so y'all can see. You're being warm in your expansive gestures even touching your friends but you're also showing that you're not afraid to take control on a physical level. There's absolutely no sort of implied threat or violence here but these gestures still subconsciously signal to the group that you're not someone that they should pile on to. Second, rather than resisting the joke or even shooting back a zinger of your own, a very powerful technique is to simply laugh with the group. It's like Men in Black — every 20 seconds, we just wipe it. He's very young. Your friends get their aim which was laughter and you get to show that you can separate who you are from the aspect of you that is being teased whether it's your haircut, your clothes, something you did in the past, you realize that those things don't define who you are so it's easier to look at them with an element of humor. This is a critical mindset which we'll touch on more later but just know for now that this is actually what separates the people who constantly get teased from the ones that the group just kind of gives up on. If they laugh with it, it goes away in most cases. But for now, to make laughing at yourself even more powerful, you're going to want to double down on the joke. This might initially feel like it makes you more the laughingstock but if you try it, you will realize that it actually puts you back in control of the conversation. Just watch. What's amazing here is that you are transforming a moment where people might have laughed at you making you feel uncomfortable into one where you're showing your good humor and confidence. You amplify a joke and spread the laughter. And if you've just cracked the best joke, people will be listening and reacting to you so you can then take the conversation wherever you like. Again, this is specifically for friends and people who have your back. If you feel like the teasing has crossed the line, check out one of our other videos to learn how to deal with someone who has crossed into bully territory. And this brings us to our third major point. If you're an awkward person, chances are that the people around you have some pretty embarrassing stories of yours in their brains so rather than let those be narratives told about you which may draw laughter at you, it's incredibly useful to know how to tell a gripping story so friends ask you to tell your own embarrassing stories. When this happens, it shows a supreme level of confidence since you're the one comfortably and comically relating what most people would be embarrassed about. For instance, I have to wear a thong underneath and other than that, that's it. You know, the first time they ever gave me the thong, they were like, I was like, no, why would I wear a thong? And they were like, yeah, you have to because it makes the suit look better and I'll never be the same. I'll never be the same again. Now, telling good stories is a huge topic but there's a couple of things that Tom demonstrates that will take your stories to the next level so that you become the one in charge of your own narrative. First off, it's likely the case that your body language won't always be ideal and that is totally fine but as you begin a story, activate the confident body language tips that we mentioned in the first point especially if the story involves self-deprecation. This has the obvious effect of commanding the attention of the audience but it also is how you signal underlying confidence while telling stories where you literally may be insecure or bumbling. Watch how Tom does it here. It's useless. I was trying to find a pulse. I don't know how to do that. She has no pulse. Oh, no, she does. She does. I just don't know how to do that. Second, up the emotional impact by choosing high-impact words. It is no secret that good stories can feel like exaggerated versions of the truth. People need a reason to listen to a longer story and incorporating words that have emotion packed into them by their very nature is a simple way to get people paying attention so that you're not left talking to an audience who isn't engaged with what you're saying. My family and I went to Hawaii in January. Very nice. That's an amazing trip. I wasn't living at home. I rented a house near the studio with my friends which I think was the best summer of my life because football was coming home. I woke up and I panicked. I was like, oh my god, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to ghost you. And he obviously didn't reply for ages because of the time difference in LA so that was maybe the most stressful day of my life where I thought my relationship with Downey was over. You'll also get your audience more engaged if you embody the characters in your story. This means body language acting out the events of the story as well as matching their voice type and even their accent. But the funny thing is the director got too excited at times. He was like, Tom, can you climb up that wall and then do a double backflip off here on a there? I'm like, no. Obviously, you're unlikely to have a dialect coach like Tom and you're probably not as good as accents. It's okay since even the attempt goes a long way towards creating humor in the middle of your stories but perhaps most importantly to these awkward stories and to everything else that we have covered when it comes to awkwardness is the mindset that you go into it with. If you have the right mindset, you don't need to have the exact technique in every situation since it makes those charismatic habits flow naturally and it's this — 99% of the awkward situations you will encounter in your life are made worse because you're fighting to be perceived in a certain way. If you would just let go of managing people's opinions, most of the awkwardness would disappear. So if you're ever feeling awkward, just ask yourself, what perception am I fighting right now? And then relax in knowing that it's only a perception of you because your deepest confidence is not based in controlling the perceptions of others but embracing the truth of who you are. And just so you know, you're not perfect. There's always going to be things about you for others to criticize or tease or for you to feel embarrassed about. It's in recognizing those less than perfect facts and liking yourself anyway that true confidence is generated. So if you can tune into that truth that like everyone else, you sometimes do dumb, embarrassing, or silly, or regrettable things, you're going to handle stressful situations, social blunders, and criticism without having to feel awkward. So embrace the truth kind of like Tom. And I don't know what I can say. I don't even know how to react to what Tom just said there. I mean, I really don't. What did I just say? You said Spider-Man's in space. Oh, that thing. Right, yeah. It's really awesome. If you want to level up your charisma fast, I would definitely recommend checking out our course, Charisma University. The course gives you both the actions and the mindsets that lead to massive leaps in your charisma so that people around you from your work to your social life are going to find themselves drawn to your presence and your confidence. Now, the course is set up so that you spend 20 minutes a day on it for 30 days. You're doing one small thing every single day that builds easy but sometimes counterintuitive charismatic habits and that's all while ingraining those mindsets that make those good habits just happen naturally in the future. So if you want to join or you learn more about that course, you can click on the screen here or in the description below. This course is truly the most actionable and fastest resource that I have ever made for maxing out your charisma. So if that's something that you're interested in, I hope to see you on the inside.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Today, you're going to learn seven easy ways to make people laugh and love being around you. The first is a ridiculously easy way to make people laugh whenever someone asks you a question. Watch this clip of Bo Burnham and see if you can guess what the technique is. You must have a lot of young people that say, Bo, how do I get into the business? How do I accomplish what you've accomplished? What's your advice for young people? I'd say, well, you gotta just take a deep breath and give up. It's that simple. When someone asks you a question, think of what they expect you to say and say the opposite. This gets the biggest laugh if it's something most people wouldn't say out loud. I'm worried about this environmental stuff. You really are worried about it. I am and I'm not. I just also feel like, you know, it'd probably be a good thing if most of us died. Do you enjoy being a mom? That's all right. As you just saw, you can soften this with a smile or a laugh so people know you're joking. If you don't want to go dark with your humor, another great way you can make people laugh is answering questions using Looney Tunes logic. What would the answer be if this were a cartoon? Here are two great examples with Ryan Reynolds. So and is she good on a plane? She's pretty good, you know, I mean, you know, that's a long flight. I mean, I carry a blow darts, you know, and then I just inhale one for myself. I'm happy for Paul because, yay, he's possibly the nicest human being in all of show business. He's aging backwards because of his contract with Satan or he only drinks breast milk from a blue whale or something. Remember, for both these techniques, getting asked a question is your cue. When you're building a new habit, cues are incredibly helpful. So you can go about your social life as normal and then whenever anyone asks you a question, that's your trigger to either answer the opposite or use Looney Tunes logic. That's how you build the habit. Once you get people laughing, the easiest way to keep them laughing is to double down on your joke. This is often what gets someone to go from, oh, that was a funny joke to, oh, this is a funny person. As an example, listen to Ryan Reynolds talk about his parents the first time he was on Ellen. You know, it's interesting to look at them. To look at them, you'd never know they're cannibals. I've heard them. They look just like two normal people. Once he sees he's gotten a laugh from the audience, he doubles down. You're so proud of him right now. Man, I had a sister once. They— If you do this too much, you risk killing the joke but you're almost always in the clear to follow up once or twice. Notice in this next clip how Sona laughs harder both times Conan doubles down. I'm a guy. I'm a man's man. You're not a man's man. I am. Women want to be with me. Men want to be on top of me. Men want to be— Women want to be with me. Men want to be in me. No. It's a way to disclose that I can't. There's a small trick you can do here if you really want to look witty. Add a little bit more specificity to the joke the second time. Where do you get your haircut, Conan? I don't— This isn't real. This is scientists' work on this. This is— This is a high-density polymer that NASA invented. If this seems hard to do, there's an even easier way you can make people laugh. Double down on someone else's joke. But have you ever been tempted to just jump up behind a podium in front of your kids to tell them, you know, go to your room using the great Barack Obama voice? My fellow Obamas, the time has come. I'll try that out. It's that simple. The other person has done the work to find a joke framework that works in that moment. They've laid it out for you. All you have to do is laugh and follow it up. Here's another funny example with Will Arnett, Alison Brie, and Seth Rogen. For context, they're talking about the time Alison had to tell her husband about her movie called Sleeping With Other People. So it means that you had to come home and say, Hey, look, I think I'm going to do this movie called Having Sex With Other People or whatever. Yeah. Sleeping With Other People. Like that's like— That would freak me out. Hey, I think I'm going to do Mass Orgy 4. Is that cool with you? Will's done the clever bit and come up with a funny premise. Movie titles you wouldn't want to tell your husband you're in. Now Seth can simply steal that framework and get a huge laugh. Is that cool? This movie called I Left My Husband for Another Actor. You may worry that people won't like this because you're stealing their spotlight. But actually, as long as you laugh at their joke first, they'll feel great because you're showing you like their humor enough to build off it. If this is the habit that appeals to you the most in this video, then your cue will be noticing when someone else makes you laugh. Now, let's talk about how to be charismatic if someone teases you. Many people get nervous when their friends tease them because they think it makes you look bad. But actually, if you handle it well, then being teased is a fantastic chance to look confident and make people laugh. I read that book. Yeah. It's a chick book. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know. Know your enemy. There's tons of ways to banter back when someone teases you. But for this video, we'll focus on what to do if you find yourself getting defensive. It's called the reverse defense. When you catch yourself trying to look cool, double back and undercut what you just said to defend yourself. This sounds complicated, but it's super easy. For example, listen to Jack Whitehall get defensive about looking weird and then reverse direction to get a laugh. Yeah, I found my sketchbook from when I was at school and in it, there were some drawings, some sketches that I'd done of the rock because I was that obsessed with it. How old— Not weird ones. How old were you? Just him naked on the Shed's lawn. The key here is to use your knee-jerk reaction of getting defensive as a setup for a bit of misdirection. Here's one more quick example with Sona and Conan. Sona says Conan doesn't know anything about cars. Conan initially tries to defend himself, but then he leans into pretending he knows nothing. I have a lot of wisdom. I do. What do you— You know— You know cars? I do know cars. No, you don't. That's a car right there. Yeah. This doesn't have to be limited to when you're defending yourself. This is just a specific version of the fake-out method we've covered in past videos. Anytime you can set up expectations going one way and then go another, you can get a laugh. I came into my son's bedroom the other night and he looked— He looked really sad. I said, what's the matter, buddy? Because I don't know his name. I'm never home. As you just saw, the easiest setup for the fake-out method is something that makes people expect you to say something sweet. You're a big— Let me tell you something. Yeah. And I mean this. I don't care how many talk shows are out there, who's hot, who's the latest, whatever. At the end of the day, on this network at this hour, there's nobody. Now, if everything in this video seems too complicated, you're going to love this last technique because it doesn't require any quick thinking in the moment. First, think of the most common conversations that tend to come up around you and then come up with some go-to jokes ahead of time. You'd be surprised at how often the comedians that you think are so impressively quick-witted in the moment are simply reusing jokes they've told before. For instance, Craig Ferguson has a go-to joke for whenever you want to playfully express you don't like what someone is saying. Can you drink coffee when you're pregnant? You can— I think you can have a cup. I don't drink coffee. Oh, you don't? It makes me crazy. How long have you been in Al-Qaeda? Have you ever watched Doctor Who? No. I know. Really? That's interesting. How long have you been in Al-Qaeda? But you don't like Mythbusters? I don't— There's something about it like I just have to turn it off if it's on. Really? How long have you been in Al-Qaeda? This is so easy but it gets a laugh every time. Here's another example. Kevin Hart knows that because he's short, people are going to remark about his appearance so he has go-to jokes for the situation. I'm like a sex symbol, isn't there? It's like— Honestly, it looks like somebody drew me. It's like perfect. I'm a sex symbol. It's hard. It's hard. The goal here isn't to simply steal Kevin's joke and parrot it. This joke works for Kevin because it fits his personality. So what you want to do is think of jokes that will fit your personality and charisma style. If you want help with that, you may like our program, Charisma University. On day three of the program, we walk you through exactly how to craft great answers to the most common questions. You'll get fill-in-the-blank worksheets so that it's effortless to know what to say and you'll get exercises to help you get used to answering in a way that feels easy and natural. That's what's nice about Charisma University. We try our best to make the YouTube videos as helpful as possible but in our 30-day program, we're able to lay everything out sequentially so you know exactly what to do each day to become more charismatic. Now, rather than tell you more about it myself, I think the best way to let you know what CU is about is to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few things that members have written in. The first is from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs at medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I had, hands down, the best interview out of everybody and that they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. Another person wrote in about their social life saying, It has truly been incredible. I've instantly had results that seem insane. So many more meaningful connections, my friendships have improved, and my interactions with total strangers are a new, exciting, fulfilling thing. I want to recommend this to everyone. And this last one is from someone who says it's been life-changing. Your course has been life-changing to the point where I wake up in the morning feeling like I've been transferred to a new person's body, the person I kept dreaming about becoming before I found Charisma on Command. It is incredible. I've found myself and I've found what makes me happy. If you want to check the course out, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of people go through the course and get a ton out of it and I'd love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 546}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Elon Musk seems to have a formula for taking an impossible dream and making it a reality. So in this video, we'll go through 6 tricks you can steal from Elon to achieve your most ambitious dreams, specifically by learning to think like a genius and find solutions that no one else sees. The first obstacle that holds most people back isn't actually lack of talent, it's fear of failure. Sadly, it's super common for someone to be so scared of failure that they don't even make a real effort at achieving their dream. From the outside, it's easy to assume Elon has superhuman confidence that he'll always be successful, but listen to him talk about founding Tesla and SpaceX. So the question isn't how to be fearless, it's how can you feel fear and do it anyway? Here's Elon explaining why he was able to invest $100 million into something he didn't I feel fear quite strongly, but if what I'm doing is important enough, then I just override the fear. Drive overrides fear. Drive overrides fear sounds great in theory, but unfortunately, we've all had something we thought was important to us, but couldn't find the courage to pursue. That's because vague dreams aren't motivating. The trick is to create a very specific picture of the future that energizes you. For example, listen to how specific Elon's vision was for starting SpaceX. In your own life, if your goal is vague, like quit your job and start a business, that's unlikely to overcome fear. Instead, create a specific vision for your future. This can be as simple as you waking up every day without an alarm, walking to the beach, and drinking a coconut in a hammock. The more detailed and inspiring your vision is to you, the more it will motivate you to act. Now, despite Elon's high chance of failure, he's been incredibly consistent at making his visions a reality. The number one thing he attributes this to is his ability to use first principles thinking. Here's a quick explanation from Elon. That's a bit heady, so here's a real example from SpaceX. Most people looking to start a space exploration company would look at how other rockets have been built and copy their design. This copycat approach is called reasoning by analogy. Elon found that rockets in their current form were too expensive, so he asked, why are rockets so expensive? They're built from scratch every time and only used once. Well, does it have to be that way? That last part is the magic question with first principles thinking. Does it have to be that way? It's the question that led Elon to create reusable rockets, and it will let you find solutions that no one else sees and live a life that most people think is impossible. Watch here as Elon lays out why it makes sense to always question your imagined limitations. So let's say you think you can't achieve your dream because you need to work full time to pay the bills. Does it have to be that way? What if you used technology to automate part of your job, or hired a virtual assistant to help you? What if you quit, moved abroad somewhere inexpensive, and now you only need to work part time to pay the bills so the rest of your time can go towards your dream? So do you really need to go into the office and work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week? Today, those are constraints worth questioning. What an employer wants isn't to have you physically located somewhere 40 hours a week. They want you to add value to the business beyond what they pay you. This ties directly into the next habit that has led Elon to incredible success, a focus on delivering value. Listen to this extremely simple mental framework for what a business actually is. A company is just a group of people that are assembled to create a product or service. That's the purpose of a company. People sort of always forget this elementary truth. Most people focus on themselves and what they get from work, which, ironically, tends to make them less valuable and therefore they don't get paid much. Elon became absurdly wealthy by focusing on making a product that's good for the world and good for his clients. If you don't have a compelling product at a compelling price, you don't have a great company. This is true of any ambitious dream, not just business. If you want to be a rock star, focus on making music that hooks people and moves them emotionally. If you want to be a pro athlete, then focus on being a player that can help your team win at a high level. Another trick related to first principles thinking that has helped Elon be so successful is to define your top priority. Let's look at this interview for a concrete example. Elon is asked a reasonable question. How do you protect your Tesla patents so you can maintain your edge over the competition? Listen to his answer. Reasoning by analogy, aka looking at what other people do, you would never give away your intellectual property. But Tesla's top priority is to get the world to use sustainable energy. With that lens, sharing your patents is obvious, even if no one else has done it before. So if you want to achieve your dream, you need to ask yourself, what is your top priority? This trickles down into everything you do. If your priority is to stop global warming at all costs, you work 22 hours a day like Elon. If your priority is to be your own boss, then turning down millions in investor money is easy. Decisions are only hard when you lose sight of your top priority and start looking around at what other people do. And whether your dream is to be a celebrity or to create a billion-dollar business that changed the world, another mindset you can steal from Elon to get there faster is be willing to polarize. Most people try to please everyone and avoid anyone having a negative impression of them. So they share little of themselves and make no impression at all. Elon does the exact opposite. He leans into his quirky personality and throws out the normal PR playbook. He smoked weed with Joe Rogan, produced a rap about Harambe, and hosted meme review with PewDiePie. He's like a magnet that creates a strong pull or push depending on who you are and what you like. This has helped him to create a massive cult following that will support him in anything he does. Even when it's someone he cares about very much, Elon doesn't let other people's opinions control him. For example, retired astronauts Neil Armstrong and Gene Cernan were critical of Elon when he started SpaceX. Watch his reaction here. I was very sad to see that, because those guys are, yeah, those guys are heroes of mine, so it's really tough. You know, I wish they would come and visit, and see the hard work that we're doing here. And I think that would change their mind. Elon is clearly hurt by their lack of support, but it never stopped him from pushing forward with SpaceX. You're likely to face something similar as you try to pursue your dream. Some friends or family are going to tell you it's a bad idea. Just know that that's a part of the process when you achieve something extraordinary. Try to limit your downside as much as you can, but don't let someone else prevent you from pursuing your dream. Once you succeed, they'll say they supported you all along. The last mental trick to achieve your massive goal is to celebrate small victories. Elon is still many years away from achieving his goals of terraforming Mars or powering the entire world with renewable energy, but he's made great progress and is happy to celebrate each benchmark along the way. Similarly, in your own life's big goals, they may take years or decades to achieve. If you don't give yourself permission to celebrate small wins along the way, you're much more likely to get discouraged and quit. But if you can take pride in your little wins, it will energize you to keep going, and before you know it, you'll have made massive progress towards your goal. Now, if your dream is to start a business that lets you live wherever you want, work whenever you want, and do something you're actually passionate about, there's one more tip for you.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Some people can say just about anything — tell jokes that should be terrible and still make an audience roar with laughter. Until I met my wife, I always felt incomplete. Now, I'm finished. That was Norm Macdonald and it's why in this video, we'll be breaking him down to cover how you can make people obsessed with you by telling bad jokes that still manage to kill. That's fine with me about that owl. I don't give a hoot. Before the jokes, though, we have to note that in near every clip of Norm, he smiles like crazy while he's joking. Smiling is just a plain good charisma habit in most situations but with comedy, specifically, it sub-communicates you've just said or will say something worth laughing at. So by adding that mischievous smile, it makes getting the laugh much easier. What's the movie gonna be called? I know what it's gonna be called. Yeah, what's that? If it's got Carrot Top in it, you know what a good name for it would be? What's that, Norm? Box Office Poison. ... I won't belabor the point except to say that everything Norm does is enhanced by the fact that he makes you expect to laugh with his smile and demeanor and then subverts what you'd expect to laugh at which brings us to Norm's first comedy sin and second comedic habit — Norm explains his jokes. The old adage is... You have to explain a joke. There is no joke. ...but Norm flips that advice on its head by explaining jokes the audience already understands which winds up being even funnier than just being witty. To see that, watch for the reaction to the genuinely clever part of Norm's dig at Carrot Top compared to his explanation of the dig. You have a scene where you and him embrace? Yeah, lots of making out. Oh, for God's sake. It's like nine and a half weeks but Carrot Top. ... Is it called nine and a half seconds? ... It's like he's premature ejaculator. We got it, you know? In your own life, you can use this trick to turn a bad joke into a great one if it doesn't land. Just explain the punchline with a big expectant smile on your face playing like the other person would erupt into laughter if only they got the joke. It works even better with truly bad jokes since they are more obvious making the explanation less necessary and, therefore, more funny. Watch here. Now, the Bob has a beautiful face like a flower. Yeah, cauliflower. ... No offense but your face looks like a cauliflower. ... Similarly, Norm will set an audience up to think he's going to say something interesting or insightful only to hit them with the least insightful thing he could possibly say. He uses pregnant pauses to bait the audience into thinking something great is coming and then hits them with nothing which is somehow even better. ... And that's an odd sport. What they do is they combine the style and grace of boxing with kicking. ... This works because jokes are supposed to be non-obvious. Comedians will even razz one another when jokes are too obvious and they can see the punchline coming from a mile away but Norm takes advantage of this expectation by making his punchline so stupidly obvious that they manage to surprise you. So if you find yourself stuck with nothing interesting to say to close out a thought or a story, purposely saying the least interesting thing possible can save you. This takes guts because it has to be as lame or redundant as possible for it to be funny. If it's only mildly uninteresting, you're actually just being boring. You've got to commit like Norm does here. I asked you to come on and I find out you pushed out on me and quit smoking. What is that all about? No, because it's bad for you. ... They have these things on the side. You have to read the fine print where it says it's bad. ... Now, another adage of humor is the jokes are funnier when told in the first person even if they didn't really happen to you. You're supposed to hide this narrative slight of hand, though, to maintain the effect. I was on this plane once and I'm sitting there and— You ever been on a plane? No, but it's a fucking joke. It works better if I tell it in the first person. Norm follows this rule — starting jokes off in the first person like you're supposed to but then he makes it painfully obvious he's lying about it all having happened to him. In this next case, he purposely screws up the details of a character's name to tip off the audience. When I was young, there was a fella by— went by the name of Jacques de Gauthier. ... While I was scrambling to get out of high school, Jacques Zagatino had already— I think you just changed his last name. ... Well, you know, a man grows. He, uh— Other times, Norm uses old-timey language that you know he'd never have said to create the same effect. If this were a memoir, I would tell about my wife. What a battle axe. Honey, I look in the mirror and all I see is a fat, ugly old man and I need you to give me a compliment. She says, all right then, your eyesight is damn near perfect. I said, you dirty dog. ... And other times, he includes impossibly absurd details. In this case, he's saying that he was once a bartender with a ridiculous item behind the bar but then acts confused when Conan asks for clarification. And I see in a— right in the bottom of the bar area, there's a— there's a shoebox with a turtle in it. From where? What is that doing there? What? ... In these cases, the joke shifts from being solely about the content of the story to Norm's unconvincing first-person delivery. He's putting on a deliberately bad performance for his and the audience's enjoyment. Now, you don't need to make up stories to put the essence of this joke into practice. Instead, recognize that if you're trying to be funny and you mess up the delivery, skip important information in a story, or flub a punchline, that's not the end of the joke. It's the beginning of a new joke about how bad you are at telling jokes and that's almost always one that people love which takes us to the least copyable but most iconic Norm joke — the long, meandering prank joke. It's one where Norm delays and delays and delays the punchline. A moth goes into a podiatrist's office. The podiatrist's office says, what's the problem? And the moth says, what's the problem? Where do I begin, man? At night, I sometimes wake up and I turn to some old lady. She fell in the cold of last year. And my other boy... And this is the hardest pill to swallow, doc. And then this hellish facade... How long a drive was this? Only to arrive at the end and have the punchline underwhelm in spectacular fashion. The doctor says, moth, man, you're troubled but you should be seeing a psychiatrist. Why on earth did you come here? And then the moth said, because the light was on. These jokes do not work in normal life where the expectation is that people do tell long, unsatisfying stories so please don't deliver a three-minute long pun to your friends and family. It will not go over well. But Norm was in a setting where we expect the guests to come on with curated stories proven to get laughs. His brilliance was to upend that expectation, do everything you're not supposed to do, and finish with a pun you might hear from your dad. Upsetting contextual expectations makes this a meta joke and in Andy Richter's words... Somebody said, I got to show you something. They took on a four-mile hike to show you a dog turd. Like I said, the specifics of a three-minute pun are tough to copy effectively but you can use your environment to make bad jokes land harder than they have a right to like Norm did. You just need to pick an environment where playfulness is less expected. For instance, the first minutes of a job interview, networking event, or the initial awkward phases of a first date. Obviously, you're not going wild using toilet humor here but something light like an exaggerated compliment, perhaps joking about how the company's cool technology makes you feel like Tony Stark, that can lighten the mood tremendously. And this is a mindset that has run through everything we've covered and one that will make you much funnier if you adopt it. Norm seemed to believe that you could make just about anything funny. It didn't have to be a zippy one-liner or super quick wit which he definitely had. For him, it was about playing with whatever the moment offered and reducing all the rules down to one primary guideline — do what you can to make people smile. If you internalize that mindset, even your worst jokes can become awesome. So hopefully, that all helps to punch up your own humor from Norm but quite frankly, there won't ever be another Norm. Now, if you want to become the most charismatic and confident version of you, that is something we can help with and you might like to check out our course, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program for building your confidence and charisma as quickly as possible. Over 9,000 people have joined the program so far and here's what just a few of them have to say. Loving the course — I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation module. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for over a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was just too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now, we are dating.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"After watching an interview on Jimmy Fallon where Sophie Turner comes across as very charismatic, I started looking into doing a breakdown on her but I was surprised to find that she actually says she struggles in social situations. I felt jealous of Maisie because she is one of the best people with, like, interacting with people. She walks into a room and she, like, lights up a room and I walk into a room and I'll immediately go to, like, a corner and try to get as drunk as possible so I don't have to talk to anyone. Second watch through, I realized that hints of her nervousness were actually present in that first Jimmy Fallon interview so in this video, I thought it'd be good to learn what it seems Sophie has already learned — how to turn anxiety, shyness, and nervousness into charisma. First off, when you are nervous, vulnerability is your friend. Not only does it calm you down because you feel like you don't have to fake anything but it can actually make people around you begin to root for you if it is displaced wisely. Now, you've already seen Sophie speak about her discomfort in social situations but she went even further on Dr. Phil sharing stories of how criticism from Game of Thrones fans led her into depression. Did social media cause you to get depressed? I think it definitely was a bit of a catalyst. You see ten great comments and you ignore them but one negative comment and it just, like, throws you off. To be clear, when Sophie opens up like this, it isn't just random. Your level of vulnerability should change as the situation calls for it and it's after a question on jealousy that she shared her envy about Maisie's sociability. It was on Dr. Phil when asked about mental health that she opened up about depression so matching your vulnerability to the situation is key. For instance, before a big interview or a speech, a fine response to, how are you doing, could very well be, I'm actually really feeling butterflies right now. What might be overkill in that situation is to delve into depression because that is not what has been asked of you. Now, interestingly, Sophie's vulnerability extends beyond her words. Positive emotions shine through when she's feeling enthusiastic. One big one is you have to have your hair up because they will chew on your hair. Oh, I love that free haircut as well. Perfect. I'm excited. Good, good. Let's do it. Alright, let's go. Both her pride and her bashfulness come through when she receives praise. Someone like you that is an absolute icon to your generation. He thinks the world of you, by the way. Thanks. So... And sometimes, that bashfulness can even cross over into shyness when she is complimented in a way that feels extreme to her. The tight lips and the barely restrained smile are the giveaway in this clip. You're on the biggest show in the world, Game of Thrones. You're about to be... ...in the biggest movie, Dark Phoenix. It appears that Sophie has no poker face and it probably makes her a terrible liar but that's actually something that brings people closer to you. Her feelings are obvious both in her words and her expressions. When people do the opposite, never revealing too much, we struggle to feel at ease wondering if they're secretly judging us or disliking us. But when you're talking to Sophie, you probably know how she's feeling which can then make you relax and this is a hallmark of other authentic types that we've covered in past videos though they might create this feeling in a variety of ways. And just to be clear, simply being authentically shy isn't charismatic. It's being shy but still making that effort to engage. I'm going to go deeper into this in a later point but keep that in mind. You also need to wear more than just your shyness on your sleeve. Sophie has bursts of energy that are totally captivating. You just got married. I did. Okay. Let's clear this up. That's in a different scene and, also, we all have the same cups. My boyfriend's become a White Walker aka he's ghosted me. Oh! What's cool is that this has a different effect on the audience than someone who is always high-energy like a Will Smith, for example. Now, don't get me wrong. That is a great habit and it can pull people into your world but when shyness is revealed prior to these enthusiastic bursts, it feels exciting for the other person because they feel like they have been a good conversational partner. They've navigated conversation in a way that made you feel comfortable which then makes them feel special and like you more because of it. Now, the next thing that can help a shy individual is knowing how to handle back-and-forth conversation where you don't immediately know what to say. Of course, it's not that Sophie doesn't know what to say every time she's asked a question. There's plenty of times where she just goes right into an answer but I want to focus on strategies that she uses in other occasions because they can be useful to shy people. So the first is simply active listening. Active listening involves any combination of cues that signal to the other person that you are interested and engaged with what they're saying. No need to dive deep here. It looks like this. I saw you at the Met Gala. Yes, briefly. Yeah, it was really fun. The second is a bit more sophisticated. It's mirroring — repeating a pattern of behavior of the person that you're interacting with. You can watch Sophie mirror gestures which makes the person that she's talking to subconsciously feel like she is like them. You also see verbal mirroring with the repetition of the last few words of the other person's sentence and that has the added benefit of buying you time to think of what to say next if you're someone who isn't necessarily very quick when under social pressure to respond. The theme was camp. The theme was camp. Yes. And so everyone was very campy. Everyone was very camp. Yes. We went to Granny Annie's. Granny Annie's. Two-for-one cocktails. Two-for-one cocktails. Smash them. Daiquiris. Shopping. As strange as it sounds, sometimes the thing that most makes people like you is not when you are smart and funny but when you make them feel smart and funny and hearing their own words spoken back to them in an encouraging voice or seeing themselves in your gestures goes a long way towards making that happen. So if you're shy, remember, you can have a great interaction without needing to make yourself the center of attention. In fact, making the other person feel special can be even more effective in making friends. Now, repetition and mirroring don't need to be exact so to spice things up, you can elaborate on the idea that someone has suggested like in this clip when Sophie elaborates on Jimmy's joke. It's a classic yes end. You repeat someone's joke and then expand upon it. It's a cardboard cutout of Joe Jonas. You didn't even come with him. No, I didn't. I'm not actually married to him. You're not even really married. No, I just took his cardboard cutout to the Little White Chapel. I married him. Don't go there! Don't go there! Don't go there! Don't go there! There! Here! Here! And the last thing that you could do if you are shy which is a culmination of many of the previous points is to make fun of your own shyness. Own it. Now, we saw Sophie do it before but a lot of her stories are about how strange she acts when she's under social pressure. And then I came out with Joe and Justin goes to Joe. He's like, Yo, Joe, I heard you got a new girl and Joe was like, Yeah, yeah, there she is. She's over there and I don't know what came over me to do this but I turned around and I was like, Hi. Sophie will also use fake grandiosity to the same effect. She's poking fun at herself for not being as cool as she's pretending. Now, definitely do the grandiosity as an overplayed character. Put on the voice. Use extreme facial expressions or else it may be mistaken for genuine grandiosity and that's something that we discussed in the video on Brie Larson if you're curious how it can go sideways. But I've always loved Justin Bieber and then I met him once. Well, I've met him like twice now. The idea behind both of these jokes is that you own your awkwardness or your shyness and you make something silly of it for everyone to laugh at. Now, I do want to leave a word of caution with these self-deprecating jokes. Whether or not it's going to bring you closer to someone or just make them feel awkward comes down to how at peace you are with the aspect of yourself that you are teasing. When you feel comfortable with your shyness, for instance, or your awkwardness, when you've accepted it and released any shame around it, the self-deprecation tends to be laughed at and it improves your social standing. People know this because you're not looking to them for a validating response but when you feel insecure about something, you're looking for people to reassure you that it's not the case that you truly are the thing that you're teasing or you're simply racing to beat them to noticing the thing that you don't like in yourself and it can come off as alienating to that person. Now, if you could use a bit more help with anxiety, I found that something called cognitive behavioral therapy can work wonders for diminishing it. It has some very actionable and practical tools that you can use in the moments that you feel yourself becoming anxious. Feeling Good by David Burns is an excellent resource to begin with CBT and you can get that for free today courtesy of our sponsor for this video, Audible.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Like it or not, we have all felt insecure. It's something even world-famous celebrities have to deal with. I feel like you think that I'm a terrible person. Is that what you're thinking? What are you thinking? Because worrying about what other people think of us is such a universal experience, in today's video, we'll go over some easy ways you can look more confident and some techniques you can use to actually build more confidence. We'll do this by breaking down clips of Scarlett Johansson. She does a great job of coming off as confident and likable even when she's expressing feelings of insecurity. You can improve both your self-confidence and other people's perceptions of you simply by adjusting your body language. One way in which Scarlett is able to convey confidence while she speaks is with her hands. We all know that when you're nervous, your body tends to tighten up leading to short, stiff movements or fidgeting. By contrast, bigger hand motions while you're speaking convey confidence. An easy way to learn this if you aren't sure where to start is the voice rule. Simply move your hands in rhythm with your voice. Watch these two clips of Scarlett to see what I mean. Honestly, it brought a closure to me that I needed. Just go see it. It's great. It's so unusual. It's so fun. In addition to making you look comfortable and confident, purposely getting your arms away from your body and making bigger gestures will actually start to make you feel more confident as you speak. If you've been watching the channel for a while, you probably noticed Scarlett has another good body language habit — she shows her palms when she gestures. We've mentioned before how revealing your palms shows that you have nothing to hide whereas hiding your palms makes you seem less trustworthy. In addition to that, revealing your palms will also make you more confident by overriding that natural tendency to shrink and close off when nervous. You probably never noticed this before but watch how often Scarlett reveals her palms in conversation. She came last night to the Rough Night premiere and we did get kind of trashed. I ordered wings and a Caesar salad. You touch after you do eat those hot wings, I'm just saying. Yes. Yes. Yes. By moving your hands in rhythm with your voice, getting your elbows unstuck from your ribs and showing your palms, you'll go a long way to both looking and feeling more confident. Now let's move past body language and on to tips for what to actually say. One of the most frustrating parts of feeling nervous or insecure is how your mind goes blank in conversation. Suddenly, all the normal wit and charm that you have when you feel comfortable goes out the window. When you find yourself in that situation, you want to buy yourself a few seconds of time to think in a way that feels unforced and natural to the other person. One way to do that is the echo technique. Listen to how Scarlett responds to Jimmy Fallon when she isn't immediately sure what to say. Did you take anything from the set? Um, did I take anything from the set? Echoing a question like that gives you time for your mind to catch up when you're feeling nervous. It's also an easy form of mirroring which helps you connect with the other person. I'm so excited about it. I can't wait to share it with everybody. And then where's ours? That's crazy. Yeah, that is crazy. You also have made a lot of money but I'm saying you've made the studios a lot of money. Yes, the studios have made a lot of money with the films I've been in. Repetitions may seem insignificant but psychologists have found that when you repeat someone's words back to them, it can help build feelings of likability, trust, and rapport. So next time you find yourself in a social situation and want to buy yourself time to think or just build a connection, use the echo technique. You'll be surprised to see how much this little habit can improve your conversations. Just don't overuse it. While this is a good way to cope with insecurity in the moment, eventually, you'll want to overcome your fear of being judged at a foundational level. The first step to overcoming your fear of being judged by others is to stop judging yourself so harshly. The quickest way to do that is to learn to laugh at yourself. Watch in these next clips how Scarlett laughs after saying something she's embarrassed by. Yeah, he was kind of like, he was like, Oh, hey, you were in the video or whatever. Sorry, that's a bad impression. I knew who it was right away. Sorry. It's so embarrassing. You'll cut that out later, right? The White House Correspondent Center and Obama was hilarious actually. He really like — we were all drink the Kool-Aid. We were sold. It was amazing. Well, do you think that he has a future in — Oh, wait, that sounded terrible. Being able to laugh at yourself is a great marker of confidence. It also makes you more fun to be around. But laughing at yourself is easier said than done. It can feel forced if you're not actually comfortable laughing at your own mistakes. So what can you do to genuinely become more comfortable laughing at yourself? Scarlett has a good trick for this. Watch how she talks about auditioning for commercials as a kid. I had a very deep husky voice and so all those kids parts, you know, I'd open up my mouth and it was like Ethel Mermaid. I mean, it's just not — did not match the pigtails and the overalls. Here's one more quick example where Ellen asks Scarlett about her first kiss. See if you notice what's similar between these two clips. And was it a French kiss? Oh, yes. Wow. I don't remember if — I don't think so. I think it was like one of those gross in-between ones that's sort of like — I think that's — I know. In both clips, she's sharing embarrassing stories from her distant past. If you don't feel confident enough to laugh at embarrassing moments as they happen, then this is a great place to start. It gets you practice laughing at yourself without actually highlighting any present-day flaws you may be insecure about. So now you have a practice to expand your comfort zone and build up your foundational base of confidence. But what about those high-pressure moments where even confident people start to feel insecure? This varies from person to person but we all have that one area that we feel extra nervous. Some common examples would be approaching someone attractive, giving a public speech, or performing on stage. Watch how Scarlett handles feeling nervous after Stephen Colbert asks her for spoilers about the Black Widow movie. I can't say anything and now you're getting me all wound up. I'm afraid something's gonna slip and my palms are sweaty. Common advice when you're nervous is to play it cool and basically ignore the emotion through willpower. For some people, this is great advice. If it works for you, stick with it. For other people, trying to play it cool only makes things worse. So if you find yourself in a situation where you're caught in a mental loop thinking about how nervous you are and it's stopping your ability to perform or to connect, it can be better to share what you're feeling with a smile rather than try to hide it. As you'll see in this next clip, a loop breaker like this can be enough to make the negative feeling go away. Are we nervous about tonight? I'm always nervous about stuff like this because... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Always nervous about it. The whole thing makes me nervous but now that I'm talking to you, I feel better. Depending on the situation, admitting your nervousness with a smile can even make you more likable. It allows other people to feel comfortable about their own negative emotions by seeing you comfortably admit yours. And ironically, by volunteering to share it, you show it doesn't bother you as much as it bothers most people who would try to hide it. Revealing your insecurities with a smile can also help you overcome your fear of being judged because it reinforces the belief that you aren't ashamed of who you are. That said, don't fall into the trap of oversharing and telling everyone how nervous or embarrassed you are every time the feeling strikes. So that's the last resort if you can't get out of your own head in a high-pressure situation. But how do you make it so that you don't even feel that nervousness at all? One incredibly effective way is gradual exposure therapy. Basically, take the situation you want to stop feeling nervous in, find a low-stakes way to mimic it, and then get a bunch of repetitions in. The good news is social courage is a muscle that is transferable. Meaning, if you push your social comfort zone in any way, whether it's by public speaking, a job interview, talking to people you don't know in social situations, whatever it is, if you push your comfort zone, it will bleed over into all of the areas I just listed. In Scarlett's case, by starting her acting career at a young age, she got a lot of exposure to rejection. But beyond just exposure therapy, Scarlett developed a trick you can use to soften the blow of rejection. She shares it in this next clip with Barbara Walters. How did you handle rejection? When you're auditioning that much, as much as I did when I was a kid, you get rejected most of the time. I was very competitive and I think I always had this weird — I don't know, I felt like it was their loss. The trick is to reframe success and failure. In Scarlett's case, she reframed failure as the other person being wrong about her and missing out. That's a great way to protect your ego. At the same time, it can hold you back by making you think you don't need to do anything to improve yourself. I would argue there's an even more useful reframe for you. Rather than framing success as getting one specific job or one specific date, reframe success as doing anything that improves you. So even if you're rejected, as long as you reflect on what went wrong and how you can do better when you're in that situation again, that's a win. If you genuinely do that and are proactive about this gradual exposure therapy, you will very, very quickly be fearless. Now that said, confidence alone will only take you so far. Whether you're looking for a new mentor, more friends, or more dates, there's obviously a lot more to it than just feeling confident. You have to be able to approach someone and start a good conversation, hook them in the first few minutes so that they want to learn more about you, and then build a real connection so they want to see you again. If you'd like a step-by-step guide that lays out how to quickly master those skills, you may like our program Charisma University. It's the fastest way I know to become confident and charismatic. You can read all the details in the link below, but I think the strongest way to let you know what it's all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few of the things that CU members have written in. This first one is from a guy who joined after a breakup. He says, I thought that after completing this course, I'd become a smooth talker and be able to take over a room. What I didn't realize is I get that and to feel so confident in myself. I feel liberated. Thank you for creating this course. This next one is from a woman who works as a clinical psychologist. She says, I absolutely love the content and I'm happy to pay for the modules. I'm a clinical psychologist looking for material that could help my clients who have social anxiety. Charlie's material is exactly what I was looking for. So excited to be a member of Charisma University. And this last one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career. He says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma, yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills, which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. You'll see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. And if you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. I make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Despite having social anxiety growing up, Tom Hardy has transformed himself into someone that oozes confidence and is incredibly popular. Tom's charisma is unusual because he doesn't follow the normal advice you might see on something like a body language list. He'll often slouch or fidget in conversation, doing things you're quote-unquote not supposed to do. But Tom has a few core mindsets you can steal that will instantly make you more confident in almost any social situation. These mindsets allow him to project a confident, I-don't-give-a-f**k attitude that draws people to him. The first thing that helps Tom go into any conversation with confidence is that he isn't trying to make the whole world like him. He's willing to polarize. He's accepted that some people won't like him. Listen to him answer the interview question, what kind of snack would you be? This mindset frees you to make a strong impression rather than no impression. That said, getting comfortable polarizing is a process. One habit that will help you get used to polarizing people and just help you build more confidence is to allow yourself to have authentic reactions to other people. The average person's internal dialogue is, I hope this person likes me. Part of Tom's confidence comes from doing the opposite. He's there to see if he likes you. You can hear this in the wildly different reactions he has to interviewers based on how they act and what they ask him. Compare Tom in these next few clips to see what that looks like. You know, the reaction to Venom when we first saw in early promos was social media thought he was sexually attractive — that he was hot. I mean, was that weird? I mean, is it... It's a weird question. No, I'm just curious. What is the question? The question is... Why would you ask that question? No, yeah, maybe that's not a good example of camp. You won't have to wear a gimp mask, will you? Um... Well, you know, only if I feel like it. You could lie again. I've never worn a gimp. I was wondering if you find it difficult for celebrities to talk about their sexuality. I don't find it difficult for celebrities to talk about their sexuality. Um, are you asking me about my sexuality? Um, sure. Why? Why? Um... Thank you. Okay. How do you bulk up? Fat. A lot of fat and trickery. A lot of fat and trickery. They do that with me here on Chatty Man. I'm actually painfully thin. This is obvious. Be authentic and react to people based on how they act. Unfortunately, while most people can do this when they're with their friends, they lose that authenticity when they're talking to someone they want to impress. I'm sure you've seen this before. Suddenly, they'll awkwardly laugh at bad jokes, pretend a boring conversation is a little too fascinating, and even smile while being insulted or talked down to. That's what happens when your internal dialogue is, I really hope this person likes me. Instead, next time you have a conversation that makes you nervous, purposefully shift that internal dialogue to something like, I'm excited to see if I like them. You'll feel more confident once you stop treating conversations like a one-sided tryout. If this seems daunting, there's an easier first step you can take to help you build more confidence. Stop trying to look flawless. Watch this next clip as an example. The interviewer asks Tom why he's always playing dark, psychotic characters. Tom has the opportunity to come off as cool or tough but listen to how he answers instead. Most people would hesitate to label themselves as soft or scared but, ironically, for a guy who says he got his tattoos to try to put on a fake front, Tom isn't fronting. He freely admits his fear. This is the weird paradox that you can learn from Tom. His fear hasn't gone away but he's learned to be confident while still experiencing some fear. Here's another example. Again, notice how he prioritizes being honest over trying to appear flawless. Direct candor admitting things most people would try to hide has two good outcomes for you. One, people will get the sense that you're not trying to pretend to be something you aren't and people are drawn to that kind of authenticity. Two, if you make a habit of sharing your imperfections, you will slowly build more and more confidence in yourself because you're messaging to yourself that you are good as you are. You don't need to hide parts of yourself to be acceptable for other people. Lying about your imperfections may feel easier in the short term but it will wreck your self-esteem because you're telling yourself that you aren't good enough. One thing to note, this isn't about unloading on people or forcing yourself to bring this stuff up. In each instance, Tom is simply being honest when answering a question that he's been asked. If you're concerned that this will make people like you less, don't worry. For most things, people are just paying off of you to decide how they'll feel about something. If you seem ashamed, they'll think it's shameful. If it doesn't seem like it's a big deal to you, it will be less of a big deal to them. If you're not quite sure how to do this, a good trick is to use the same tone of voice you'd use to talk about what you had for breakfast. For example, listen to Tom talk about where his addictions come from. If this still seems daunting to you, start small. You don't have to start by talking about your deepest insecurities. Start by sharing small flaws or little funny embarrassing stories. You can expand what you're comfortable revealing about yourself as your confidence grows. The next thing you want to do to feel more confident is to start prioritizing your own comfort. Here's a quick example where Tom delays the start of an interview so he can get more comfortable. Most anxious people go into social situations trying not to attract attention. So rather than taking actions to be comfortable or to stand out in a positive way, you'll try to do what you think you're supposed to do. Ironically, this mindset of blending in and doing what everyone else does actually makes you more nervous because you're constantly asking yourself, am I doing this right? For another example, you may remember Tom Hardy had a small viral moment while promoting the movie Revenant. He started eating mid-interview while Leonardo DiCaprio was trying to answer a question. Some people loved this moment for highlighting Tom's I-don't-give-a-f**k attitude. He was hungry, so he ate. People are drawn to people who seem confident in who they are. Prioritizing your own comfort shows you aren't focused solely on getting other people's approval. Now, if you only saw a few seconds of it, you might think Leo and the interviewer were upset with Tom for being rude, but it actually played out totally friendly. This is often the case when you're nervous in social situations. You have these fears that rarely come true, but they hold you back from enjoying yourself or forming new relationships. Now, whether you want to be confident because you're looking for a new mentor, more friends, or more dates, there's obviously a lot more to that than just what we've covered so far. You have to know how to start a conversation, hook them in the first few minutes so that they want to learn more about you, and then build a real connection so that they want to see you again. If you'd like a step-by-step guide that lays out how to quickly master those skills, you may like our program, Charisma University. It's the fastest way to become confident and charismatic. You can read all the details in the link below, but I figure the strongest way to let you know what it's all about is to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few things that Charisma University members have written in. This first one is from someone who says their social life has transformed. They wrote, I am significantly more confident in all social situations. The connection I feel with strangers and close friends and family alike have increased dramatically. I transitioned from someone who never got asked to hang out regularly to multiple people texting me on a daily basis. Many people have openly expressed their admiration for me and I get a lot more positive attention. I've grown so much because of this course and I cannot thank you enough. This next one comes from a guy who's been making new relationships. Before going through Charisma University, I didn't know how to bring energy to a group and I was terrible at meeting new people. Everything in my life has improved after CU, from loving myself and others more to creating and developing amazing external relationships. There's so much more joy in my life and CU has been a huge reason for it. And this last one is from a guy who joined after a breakup. He says, thank you so much for Charisma University. I thought that after completing this course, I'd become a smooth talker and be able to take over a room. What I didn't realize is I'd get that and feel so confident in myself. I feel liberated. Thank you for creating this course. If you want to join but you're not sure if it's right for you, you should know that it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. That means you can get a full refund for any reason at all. It's 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because we want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting massive value from the course. If you want to learn more, you can click the link on screen now or below in the description.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all felt that frustration of arguing with someone that just won't listen. So in this video, we'll go through six tips to actually change a stubborn person's mind without hurting your relationship. The first step is if you can, say two things they'll agree with before stating where you disagree. This sets the frame that you actually agree about more than you don't. Let's watch a clip of Jon Stewart as an example. Jon is arguing here that people are too upset with Joe Rogan for his COVID views and he knows that if you're upset with Rogan on this, it's because you think he's spreading misinformation. So listen to how he leads into his argument. There's no question that there is egregious misinformation that's purposeful and hateful and that being moderated is a credit to the platforms that run them, but this overreaction to Rogan, I think is a mistake. Here he is a minute later. Notice how he again uses this two-to-one rule. He may say some things that you think is misinformation and he may platform people that you think are wrong, but to single that out as something so egregious, I think there are dishonest bad actors in the world and identifying those is so much more important to me. The whole point of this two-to-one rule is to open up a stubborn person to be more receptive to your argument. So now, how do you actually persuade them to see things the way you do? One psychological trick you can use is to create consistency with a principle. That means you find a similar situation where you know the two of you agree. Identify the underlying principle, then show them that consistency with that principle puts them on your side of your current disagreement. Let's go through a specific example. Pretend you wanted to persuade someone it's a bad idea to ask Spotify to censor misinformation. How would you do it? John does it by drawing an analogy to the 2003 Iraq war, when he was publicly questioning the mainstream narrative that Iraq had WMDs. I was promoting what they would call misinformation, but it turned out to be right years later and the establishment media was wrong and not only were they wrong, in some respects, you could make the case that they enabled a war that killed hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people. Most people would agree we wouldn't want John Stewart to be censored for trying to stop the Iraq war. And if we agree there, then we agree that sometimes it's good to have people questioning the experts. Therefore, it can be dangerous to give institutions the power to censor anyone they say is spreading misinformation. That's how you create consistency with a principle. Let's watch one more quick example. In the liberal community, you hate this idea of creating people as a monolith. Don't look at Muslims as a monolith. They are individuals and it would be ignorance. But everybody who voted for Trump is a monolith, is a racist. That hypocrisy is also real in our country. In both these first two points, there's an emphasis on agreeing. That's because if you want to persuade someone, you have to avoid triggering the other person's us versus them psychology. And this means being persuasive is about more than just the words you say, it's also about your delivery. This next clip is a good example of what not to do. Ben's destroy videos are great for building an audience who already agrees with you. But if you actually want to persuade the person you're speaking with, it's extremely important to make sure you maintain a calm conversational tone. If this is something you struggle with on certain topics, you can literally steal the sentence at the end of this next clip. Beyond tone, it's hard to convince anyone of anything if they don't like you. So a key part of persuading someone is prioritizing your connection. There are several ways to do this. A great first habit is to allow for playful breaks. Often, when someone is tired of arguing, they'll make a joke to try to lighten the mood. Some people steamroll right over that joke to make their point. But Jon momentarily sets aside the debate if there's an opportunity to build rapport. Here's a quick example. Let me go back because you're right, Jay. Jay Rogan has power because of elk meat and that is what allows him to have the energy to have all that. Jon didn't say anything insanely clever but you can see how just going along with someone's joke can help you build more of a connection. You saw it on the other guy's face. The next way you can build rapport in an argument is by clarifying the person's ideas before you disagree with them. It should look something like this next clip. Correct me if I'm wrong. What you're saying is if an artist supports someone that has been convicted of killing a cop, they should not be allowed to go to the White House. No, it's a little bit more than that. Okay, say it again. I am saying. To build rapport, it's important you do this genuinely. You don't want to pretend to be summarizing the other person's points while really strawmanning them like that Cathy Newman interview with Jordan Peterson. You were saying that intentions of conscientious by implication are not female traits. Oh, no. I mean, that's very dangerous territory. I'm not saying that at all. You're saying, well, that's just a fact. No, I'm not saying it doesn't matter either. You're saying there are multiple reasons for it. When you're arguing something, it's important to genuinely consider the opposing side. Otherwise, you'll never know when you're wrong. A great exercise is to ask yourself, when was the last time I changed my mind on a major belief? It's extremely unlikely that you got every major issue right the first time you thought about it. So if you can't think of a time you changed your mind, that's a good sign that you're not engaging fully with opposing ideas. Our sixth tip is incredibly important when you're in an argument with someone who's stubborn. Debate ideas, not terminology. A very common mistake that will absolutely ruin your ability to have a quality conversation is getting caught up in debating a specific word. A great example of this is the conversation of Ben Shapiro and Malcolm Nance on Bill Maher. The show starts with Bill asking Ben to define critical race theory. Listen carefully to how he defines it because this will be important in a minute. And so what that boils down to in sort of practical terms is all disparity equals discrimination. If you can see any stat where black people are underperforming white people, this means the system was set up for the benefit of white people and that white people have a duty to tear down these systems. Ben explicitly says that to him, part of critical race theory is about tearing down certain systems in the U.S. Malcolm initially agrees with this but then a few minutes later shifts his definition. Malcolm, you tell me your definition. Oh, I agree with everything he just said. Oh. What's happened here as this terminology, sort of like defund the police, has been hijacked and been framed around the left as that they want to do all this, they want to rip down the entire social fabric of America and they want us to be guilty about everything. I want you to teach history. So you saw there, Malcolm is now shifting to the importance of teaching black history in public schools. This is an idea that Ben agrees with. But because the conversation is centered around the term critical race theory, they're unable to talk about ideas. They can't get past the terminology. If we agree that history should be taught, why are you defending critical race theory, which is not history? Did I not just say a moment ago that I think that term has been hijacked and that's not what we're talking about? Okay, so let's say critical race theory. I'm going to go back and repeat that I didn't say that. Okay. You are literally defending critical race theory by redefining it as just teaching history, which is a cheap semantic trick and you know it. If they could just drop the word and focus on ideas, they might end up in complete agreement. But instead, they end up talking past each other and the conversation gets hostile. Is this what you do on your show because it sucks? So if you find yourself in a conversation about a specific term and things are getting heated, drop the term. You may find someone who's been stubborn in the past suddenly becomes receptive to new ideas. Now, it's worth noting how receptive someone is to your ideas isn't only based on how you present those ideas. Pre-existing rapport is a huge factor. If someone likes you, they're way more likely to find your arguments persuasive. And if someone doesn't like you, there's almost nothing you can do to persuade them. This is true beyond just debates. It's also true in asking for a promotion, selling a product, trying to land a date, or leading a team. Your success heavily depends on how well you can build rapport. If you want the ability to quickly build rapport with almost anyone, you may like our program Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in just 30 days. Here are just a few of the things that past members have written us. The first comes from a guy who was promoted to a senior position early in his career. He says, This next one comes from another person who started a new job. They say, The confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset. With all your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it just could not go wrong. And this last one comes from an army officer. They say, If you do join CU, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. We make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because we want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all been stuck in an awkward conversation that feels forced or boring you want the person to like you But you have no idea what to say So in today's video we'll go over five habits that instantly make conversation more fun and help you connect with anyone One great habit to make people love talking to you is to set a playful tone early in the interaction For example, Jordan Peterson is often a serious person. Jordan, great to have you back on the program. Well, thanks Pierce. It's good to see you again. Now watch how different Jordan is when someone starts the conversation playfully. Without reading this, so what you're saying is... There's only 12 things you need to know in life, right? That's it. You know, I grew up on wild meat. My dad hunts. He still hunts. He's 82. You know, he's slowing down a little bit obviously because he's getting old but... Yeah, he's using a gun now instead of a knife. Yeah, but he doesn't just jump on the animal. You'll see this all the time when meeting someone or catching up with an acquaintance. People want to have fun, funny conversations. They just aren't sure how. So if you can seamlessly make the conversation playful, they'll love you for it. Here's another example of Jimmy Fallon and Chris Evans discussing the Captain America sequel. Notice one joke from Jimmy instantly changes the energy. We tried to evolve his fight style and so we tried to do a little bit more gymnastics. He was flipping around and... That's right. Flipping around, balance beams. Oh, I had a whole ribbon routine. Yeah, of course. That's what we wanted to see in IMAX 3D. If you don't already do this naturally, it can be helpful to have a mental cue for it. A trigger to think to yourself, oh, this is a chance to make this more fun. So here's an easy way to learn this habit. When someone asks you a question, answer with a joke. Can you spell Dormammu for me? D-O-R-M-A-M-U. O-U. Dormammu is so fat. No, no, Chris. If you want a specific joke you can use when answering questions, there's two you can steal from this video. First, take your real answer and exaggerate so much it's impossible to take you seriously. Here's a quick example where Jimmy Fallon just told Tom Cruise that he's getting into ice skating. Sir, are you up early ice skating rink? I'm up early every day. I skate at least four times a day and then, yeah. At least four times. I skate to work. I got rollerblades now. That's good. Yeah, it's my new thing. It really is that easy. You can also take what people expect you to say and say the opposite like in this next clip. How is your summer going so far? It was too much time with my family. Again, super easy to do. Now, you don't want to do this all the time where people think you're avoiding their questions. You want to give a mix of genuine answers and playful answers. A good tip is to answer someone's first small talk question playfully and at least 25% of the small talk questions after that. Another easy way to set a positive tone early in the conversation is to give a genuine friendly compliment. Hello, Maggie. Hey. You look sensational, may I say. Thank you. If you're worried that a compliment will feel awkward, you can follow it up with a joke to diffuse the tension. For example, here's Craig Ferguson giving that same compliment to Keanu Reeves. For context, in his monologue that night, he mentioned being sick and a little loopy from cold medicine. You look sensational, man. And that's not just the cold medication talking, I'm telling you. There are three common mistakes people make when complimenting someone. Making the compliment too sexual, making a compliment you don't mean which makes you seem manipulative, and dwelling on the compliment. A compliment is great to give but especially with people of high status who hear compliments all the time, you want to transition off of it fairly quickly. A great way to make someone feel good and transition into conversation is with a compliment plus a cold read. So you compliment them and then transition to a guess about the person. It looks something like this. Dude, you got jacked. You went from being skinny to shredded. Yeah, yeah. You're pretty serious about MMA training, man. It's really just about like the lifestyle, you know what I mean? You're a martial artist, so you know. And just like that, they've skipped small talk and are off into a conversation about MMA. Now, even with perfect delivery, it can get boring and predictable if all you do is compliment someone. So a great habit is to mix compliments with funny teasing. For example, watch how Conan bounces between teases and compliments with his assistant, Sona, at different parts of their conversation. This took the strangest turn. You went from being the peppy America's sweetheart to being this Nosferatu of doom. Alright, I love you, Sona. You're a great friend. You're a great assistant. This doesn't mean you have to undercut every compliment with a tease. Sometimes you can just let a compliment sit. Playful jokes, positivity, compliments, and funny teases will all help you make a great first impression. You'll have people smiling and laughing and enjoying being around you. Now, what can you do if you want to connect more deeply with people? One way is to share your imperfections without shame. Many people think sharing your flaws will make people dislike you, but often the opposite is true. People like you more when you share your imperfections because it makes them feel comfortable with their own. After all, nobody is perfect and everybody has flaws. And it shows confidence that you're willing to share something most people would try to hide. Here's a great example of Jim Carrey at an actor's roundtable. Complete this sentence. I act because... I act because I'm broken in a lot of pieces. And acting gives me a chance to reconfigure those pieces into a thousand different things that are positive for people who watch. He's very matter-of-fact with his tone. He's not sharing this for sympathy. It's just his truth. Even if someone doesn't feel the same way, they'll respect your honesty and your confidence in sharing. Remarkably truthful. We're all broken. Let's face it. This doesn't always have to be something heavy. For a lighter example, listen to Charles Barkley talk about his broken golf swing. I have no idea how it started and I can't help it. I've tried everything. I got hypnotized. You're not kidding. I'm not. I went to see a hypnotist. All I got was a good nap. Now, so far, we focused on what you say in conversation. But you can also make people love talking to you by asking good questions that set them up well. Specifically, ask open-ended questions. Questions with one-word answers can make it difficult for the other person to contribute, especially if they're on the shyer side. Our youngest player here at 17 years old, is that correct? Yes. Still a high school student? Yeah, I'm in grade 12 right now. Perfect. Perfect. Unfortunately, this is how most people have conversations. Where are you from? Do you like it there? A series of questions with one-word answers that force the other person to do the work to make the conversation interesting. By contrast, open-ended questions naturally lead the other person to share more. Why Utah, man? Why do you live in Utah? What's that about? Why is a fantastic open-ended question to ask because it gets the other person talking about what motivates them and what they value. This will naturally lead to a more interesting conversation. The best open-ended questions are questions the person will be excited to answer. For example, if someone shares a dream they have for their future, ask them why they want it. Why do you want to tell a great story? Once they're talking, you can deepen your connection by being a likable listener. Let's go through two easy ways you can do that. The first is to mirror them by repeating their words. Here's a quick example with Pharrell and Oprah talking about his song, Happy. We put out the video on November 21st, all of a sudden, boom. Boom? I mean, when I say boom, you mean boom. Yeah. Oprah does this all the time. It's one of the reasons her guests love her and feel a connection with her so quickly. It's the part of you that feels, um, that is drawn to hope. That's one way to understand spirit. The part of you that is drawn to hope. Mirroring someone shows them that you're tuned in and interested in what they're saying. It makes them feel heard. If this feels too on the nose for you and you don't want to repeat someone's exact words, that's okay. Repeating back the sentiment they're sharing works just as well at building a connection. You know, this need for people's approval that would send me through the roof, that would make me a high achiever. You understand what I mean? Like, you will do anything. Yeah, that's where the success comes from. The second habit of a likable listener is to laugh generously. Just watch Matthew Perry's reaction in this next clip when Craig starts laughing. I want to come up with different words for things. That's what I think I'm going to do. A pointy pointy. Oh, no, no, no. A pointy pointy. Here's another example with Brad Pitt and Adam Sandler discussing Adam's colonoscopy scene from Uncut Gems. Brad isn't trying to make a joke, but Adam finds it funny and laughs. Watch how that brightens Brad's mood. They say it's in the script, I do it. No, it was convincing. Because you looked at you had this kind of... Yeah, I did. This very feeble... I know, I know. No, that's hard to pull off. I was in a weird position. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't... It was compromising. It was compromising. This is tough because you can't fake it or it will make people dislike you. So, the best thing you can do is try to find people you genuinely enjoy being around who energize you rather than drain you. If you're meeting new people and don't know yet if you like them, then focus on making the conversation fun for yourself. Talk about things you enjoy, make jokes that you find funny, and let that filter people in or out of your life. Now, there's a lot going on in this video and you may be wondering, how the heck do you actually remember all this when you're out meeting people? Especially if you're speaking with someone who makes you nervous, it's hard to remember to put all this into practice. That's why we put together our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step 30-day program that tells you exactly what to do every day to take what you're learning and turn it into unthinking habit. So, by the end of the program, you radiate confidence and charisma naturally without even thinking about it. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. I had confidence in some areas but not in others, then Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. Another member wrote in, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. In conversations, I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think. I feel much happier all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman I've had a crush on for about a year and made a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep going back to it when I need a refresher on the daily action modules. And lastly, one member writes, thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values and I know who I am. The program is literally guaranteed to change your life. That means you can take the entire course and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund from right inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all had a friend say something we don't like. Whether it's a passive aggressive comment or a playful insult that goes too far, it can be tough to know how to respond. So in this video, we're going to cover 3 ways to handle it when a friend crosses the line and you want to stand up for yourself without starting a fight. We'll start by breaking down a few examples with Jonah Hill. In this first clip, he's reacting to insults made by a paparazzi. It's an example of how not to react. He's publicly apologized for this one. A common reaction to being hurt by an insult is to fire back an insult yourself. This works if you're both joking, but it's a mistake if your intention is to be hurtful. Especially with friends, retaliating because your feelings are hurt sets you up to hurt the relationship and, to the other friends around you, you might end up looking like the rude one even if you didn't start it. It may feel good in the moment, but you'll almost always regret it. Unfortunately for Jonah, he's been publicly insulted a lot. The good news is that over time he's gotten better at handling it. Here's an example from later in life. Now watch Jonah's response. This isn't the best response we'll cover today, but you can see the improvement. Most people insulting you are seeking something, whether it's attention, a laugh, or an emotional overreaction. To punish the behavior he doesn't like, Jonah denies the guy what he wants, attention, and an answer to his question. Sometimes with friends, this is the only strategy you need. Ignore the person and actively shift the focus to someone else in the group. Your goal is to remove any positive reinforcement of the behavior you don't like. And, as Kobe once showed with Matt Barnes, sometimes not reacting is all it takes to look confident. If that doesn't work, the next step is to draw a boundary. There's two types of boundaries, soft lines and hard lines. This next set of clips is an example of a soft line. First, check out how Jimmy Kimmel starts this interview. Pretty strange start to an interview. Jimmy tries to get a laugh with a backhanded compliment. Jonah doesn't like it, so watch how he responds. Jonah calmly and kindly calls out that he doesn't like Jimmy's comment. Then, when Jimmy starts to get uncomfortable and walk back his insult, Jonah fakes like he's going to drag this uncomfortable moment out, but then releases the tension and lets them move on. This is great because even if you're in the right, conflict makes people uncomfortable. So other friends in the group will feel a desire to move past conflict just to escape their own discomfort as an observer. That's why you calmly call out the behavior you don't like, and once it's clear that the message has been received, you move past it. You've established your boundary, and you've done it without alienating anyone else in the conversation. If a soft line doesn't work, then you may need to put down a hard line. A hard line is one with explicit consequences. Here's a great example with Julian Assange. This is for more serious situations where someone does something you find truly unacceptable. He's been told he's there to talk about documents that WikiLeaks released showing potential war crimes by the US. Instead, the interviewer asks about a personal investigation against him. He starts by calmly and firmly cutting her off and drawing a soft boundary. Now watch what he does when she doesn't respect his soft line. Three things make this a good example of a hard line. He speaks calmly, he draws a clear boundary, and he explains why the boundary is important to him. Now watch as she crosses his boundary, he stays firm and standing up for himself, but his calmness makes sure this doesn't escalate into a fight. When she still refuses to move on, he actually walks out. It's that simple. No need to yell or say anything negative about the other person. If someone does something you find unacceptable, calmly let them know, let them know why it's a boundary for you, and let them know what the consequence will be if they do it again. If they cross your hard line, simply follow through on your word. Now with friend groups specifically, there tends to be a social hierarchy. The higher up you are, the more likely it is that people will respect the boundaries you draw. If you don't feel like your friends would respect your boundaries, you may benefit from our video 6 Psychological Tricks to Command Respect Instantly. You can find it in the description and at the end of this video. Now what about situations where you aren't actually offended and you want to turn a potentially offensive comment into some friendly banter? There's three quick things you can do. The first is banter back. To highlight some tips on how to do this well, here's a quick example with Jay Leno and Louis CK. A laugh and a thank you is a great way to show your confidence and that you aren't rattled by an insult. Now watch how Jay follows up. You want to match their insult level. Louis started with a negative comment on Jay's looks, so Jay matches it. If Louis had insulted Jay's shirt and Jay had insulted Louis' weight, it's much more likely to go poorly. When you match their insult level, it's more likely they'll react well and, even if they decide they like to dish it but they can't take it, it makes it very unlikely that anyone else in the group will consider you rude. Listen for this as they go back and forth again here. They're 2 for 2 on teases, they matched each other's insult level, both laughed and neither got upset. That's what you're aiming for. Now what if someone says something potentially offensive and you want to be playful and fun, but you don't feel comfortable saying something potentially offensive back, or you just can't think of anything clever to say? There's a second thing you can do. Fake offense. As an example, here's a clip with Anne Hathaway. She fakes offense but signals it's not real with a big smile and the over-the-top facial expressions. This shows you have confidence to not be easily offended and it doesn't require the same quick wit as Jay Leno's comebacks. When he doesn't pick up on the non-verbals, she even spells it out for him. If you find yourself completely blanking on anything to say, just being able to genuinely laugh when someone tries to insult you is enough to convey confidence. Some people don't like him, but Brendon Chobb is someone who does this very well. His ability to laugh when people take shots at him is probably why he hits it off so well with comedians like Theo Vaughn and Joe Rogan, and it's a part of why he was able to make a successful career for himself after MMA. Being able to laugh at yourself projects confidence and makes it fun to be around you. All three of these are super simple, which illustrates how much easier it can be to handle an insult when you aren't actually offended. The hard part is developing the self-confidence to stay unrattled no matter what anyone says about you. If that's something you'd like more help with, I think the fastest way to become confident in social situations is with our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in 30 days, and it's structured with a daily action guide, so there's no guesswork when it comes to learning these habits. You just follow the guide and you get the results. To get a sense of what the program can do for you, here's a few things that past members have written in. I had confidence in some areas, but not in others. Then, Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. It cost less than half the price of one course at my college, but it has had a far bigger impact on me than any traditional class I've enrolled in. Another member wrote in, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. In conversations I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think and how I feel, even in bigger group settings. I feel much more happy all of the time.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"What if you could take someone who started a conversation like this? So you're a therapist? Yes. Well, I'm a psychiatrist. I don't believe in therapy, and I think it's a scam. And I don't think it's necessary. And I don't think that even if there is anything wrong with my brain, that this is going to be helpful whatsoever. And in that conversation with them saying this. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you. This was a good conversation. Thanks, man. I appreciate you. I can see that you actually appreciate your attention and focus on this. That's what we're covering today. The simple steps to make a rude person take back what they said, show you respect, and wish they hadn't even begun with the rudeness in the first place. Now, to begin, one way to deal with rude people is simply by drawing a boundary and exiting. Interview adjourned. Love you. Okay. That's the end of the interview. And to be clear, walking away from rudeness is totally fine. So is letting people know how you want them to act around you, like Tom Cruise does here when he's repeatedly questioned about his relationship. Here's the thing, Peter. You're stepping over a line now. You're stepping over a line you know you are. I suppose the questions are that people want to know. Peter, you want to know. Take responsibility for what you want to know. Don't say what other people. This is a conversation that I'm having with you right now. You're right. Put your manners back in. But while that kind of boundary can work, without a tremendous amount of power either with your tone, physicality, or your social capital, it might actually make rudeness worse. That is because Tom is telling the interviewer what he needs to do which always creates a power struggle. But there is a way to draw a strong boundary that doesn't do this. You state what you are going to do or not do in a conversation. You don't demand anything of the other person. And that means instead of saying, don't say what other people are asking, you'd say, if you're going to speak from the perspective of other people, I'm going to leave the conversation. You notice here how Dr. K doesn't tell Sneko to do or not do anything. He speaks only about what he is going to do. Let me just make a couple things clear. So I am a psychiatrist but I'm not your psychiatrist. Okay. Is that clear? So I'm not doing therapy with you, right? You're not my patient. I'm not going to be diagnosing you or treating you for anything. Okay. Now, sometimes, it's not practical to explicitly draw boundaries like this. So there is a more subtle way to get the same effect and that is by practicing non-engagement with the unwanted behavior. One way to do that is with a magic word. You can watch Dr. K nail it here. If I go to a therapist, your job is to take my money for my mental health problems. Why would you want me to get better? You don't. You want me to keep coming back and paying you. So you're going to tell me, oh, come back next week and we'll unpack this and we'll unpack that. I don't need to unpack all this from childhood. I'm 25. I'm going to shove it down and keep going. Why do I want to unpack this stuff? Okay. Said with a friendly tone, okay can completely deflate someone who is bringing aggressive energy to you. It works because prolonged rudeness is usually looking for a reaction from you and if you don't give it any, it falls apart quickly. Another way to implement the same principle of non-engagement is by responding to rudeness slowly and with sincerity. You can watch here how the slowness of Dr. K's response causes Snego to be more polite immediately. How long have you been doing this? What do you mean by this? Talking to people crying on the couch. Oh, psychotherapy. Psychiatry. Going slow gives the other person time to feel regret for their tone. It's a non-aggressive way of inviting them to try again and responding with sincerity does the same thing because maintaining a rude tone with someone who is kind to you feels uncomfortable for most people. You can watch in this next clip how the sincerity from Dr. K causes Snego to adjust his approach just as quickly. Is that what you want to talk about? No, I want to talk about whatever you want to talk about. Can I cry? Sure. Okay, I don't know how this works. What are we supposed to do? That's a great question. So was there something in particular that you had in mind? Okay, what do you specialize in? I've seen you talk to some of my friends, you talked to Aiden for a couple hours, and you were able to dissect and figure some stuff out. I don't know. I think this could be an interesting conversation. I don't really know. I completely agree. I think this is going to be a very interesting conversation. Okay. Now, everything covered up until now can happen in just a few seconds and it will make people drop being rude. Mission accomplished if that's all that you want but you can still flip the interaction to become one where they respect and value you more afterwards by implementing the next piece and that is to ask open questions about the worldview underneath their rudeness. Now, here, it is critical to understand the key difference between open and closed questioning. With open questions, your agenda is to see and understand the other person. With closed questions, your agenda is for the other person to see and understand you usually by backing them into a corner to make your point. For an example, listen here how this question's word choice and tone indicate that Dr. K isn't setting traps but is genuinely curious about Sneako's perspective. So when you say that you think therapy is a waste of time, why do you think that? Closed questioning, on the other hand, is often a veiled attempt to prove the other person wrong and this will come through in your word choice and tone as well. You point to medicine. You claim that DEI programs are putting people at risk. Do you really believe this to be true and what evidence do you have to support it? This is why you can feel like you're being backed in a corner in certain conversation. It's probably because the other person is asking closed questions. The hidden goal of those questions is not to explore an alternate perspective but to assert the question asker's worldview. And in this case, Don literally pairs his statement that Elon is wrong right next to the question he just asked. What evidence do you have, though, that they're lowering the standards? There's no evidence of that. Well, I believe there is. What is the evidence? I believe they have literally lowered the standards at Duke University and that is what the article is referring to. There's no evidence of that. There's no evidence about lowering standards and I think that there is — Leave that as a false statement you're making. And of course, this derails the conversation and we end the interaction with more rudeness and disrespect than when we started it thanks to this closed stance. Yeah, choose your question. We'll get into the deeper reason that open questions work so well in the last point but for now, just know that you want to ask open questions until you can fully articulate the other person's perspective back to them in a way that they feel good about and that looks like this. Okay, so let me just make sure I heard you. So when you pray, it sounds like you feel a lot of positive emotions. You also think about actions that you want to take and places that you want to go so you have goals that you think of. Right. This should be easy to do if you've maintained that open approach but it can get derailed by the very normal tendency to assert our perspective when we hear something that we disagree with. So I want to give you two tricks to keep this easy. First, use the phrase, I don't want to debate throughout the conversation. It's obviously important that you mean it too. Not debating. Honestly, I'm not trying to like debate you. I swear to God, I'm not trying to convince you, okay? Second, if you ever are trying to assert your opinion, own it. That means do not hide statements inside of questions. That's what we saw Don do in that interview. Instead, just turn your closed question into a statement of how you feel. Let's say I don't really have faith or I'm afraid or I'm angry. Actually, forget about that. I realized I was slipping into a debating kind of mode so I'll just say what I'm going to say. Okay. Okay, so by this point, you've disarmed the other person's rudeness and used open questions to invite them to share themselves and they're likely in a receptive enough state to actually hear your perspective now given the trust that you've built but before you share your perspective, there is one more thing which may seem silly and that is to ask them if it's okay with them that you share your perspective. If you want an impression of fixing what I think is incomplete about your understanding, we can start that. Okay. You have other questions or can I dive in? You can dive in. Now, I get that this may seem overly sensitive but when someone is being rude or aggressive, it's because they are ego-identified with whatever's happening in that conversation so just hearing a worldview that's different than theirs can actually be received as a threat and that will make them be even more rude so asking them if it's okay to share can help that ego feel a sense of respect and safety which will diminish the odds of getting a backlash. For a similar reason, you'll usually want to share the areas that you agree with them first and share the areas you would disagree with them second like this. Here's where I think there's an advantage to therapy so I completely agree with everything that you've said, okay? I think the challenge though is that what you're sort of talking about is like difficulties within you so like let's just take faith, for example. This ordering subtly signals that you're not listening simply to poke holes that again relaxes the ego as it realizes you aren't here to fight with it or change it and that takes us to the most counterintuitive and most important point. If you want people to change from rude to respectful with you, the best way to get there is to completely drop trying to change them. Instead, make your aim to deeply understand them because when you give people your attention and curiosity without trying to change them, many times, the rude part of them will naturally calm down. They actually become open to hearing your experience of them in an unguarded way and you can see it, for instance, here. This next exchange occurs after Dr. K has gone through all the steps we already covered and you can imagine how different Sneedle's reaction would have been if he just said this piece right off the bat. So you say things in ways that are very polemic so like a polar. So you say things in a way that invites me to argue with you and try to prove you wrong like just the statements that you make and I can see why people are like inflamed by that and if I don't try really hard to catch myself, then I will start arguing with you. Right. Why are you smiling right now? Because you're right because you're completely right. That's just my way and people tell me that quite a bit. Dropping the goal of changing anyone will also help you to stay collected in the face of rude people because if you're thrown off by them, it's often because you think they need to change in order to defend your manhood or your honor or your reputation. In reality, the best way to defend those things is to withdraw any control you may have given them over those things which naturally makes insults slide off you and maybe even gives you the chance to turn a rude beginning into a valuable exchange. We're connecting. Yeah. Feels good to connect. Yeah. Yeah. Does it make us weak to connect? No. So now, hopefully, you'll be able to flip rudeness with charisma but charisma isn't just useful for dealing with difficult people. It's the key to making great first impressions, building strong relationships, and feeling confident in any social situation. So if you want to take this further and develop a charisma that makes people naturally tend to value and respect you, I highly recommend checking out Charisma University.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': 'Several years ago, Malcolm Gladwell faced off in the Monk debates against Douglas Murray and Matt Taibbi. The topic was should you trust the mainstream media and the outcome was one of the worst debate performances that I have ever seen. It\\'s so strange hearing you debate, Malcolm, because you listen to nothing that your opponents say. This wasn\\'t just Douglas\\'s opinion. A poll at the beginning of the debate showed that 52% of people came in agreeing with Gladwell\\'s side that you can trust the mainstream media but by the end, there had been a huge reversal with only 33% of people on his side. He lost one in three people who came in agreeing with him. So let\\'s dive into what happened and help you defend yourself against these frustrating rude debate tactics as well as avoid using them so you don\\'t destroy your own reputation. The first thing to be aware of are small lapses in kindness that could be viewed as playful jokes or harmless mistakes. In many cases, these are really covert sniping where someone takes shots at another person in an underhanded way. For instance, Malcolm makes a joke that contains a hint of judgment about Douglas\\'s earlier reference to a Canadian trucker story. I thought I\\'d just tell two very simple stories. One of them will not be about the truckers who I think have been well defended by my colleague, Mr. Murray. And then later in the debate, he can\\'t seem to pronounce Matt Taibbi\\'s last name correctly or say Douglas\\'s full first name. Greatly amused by the affection Matt Taibbi has, Matt Taibbi\\'s father and grandfather, Matt Taibbi. Doug is speechless. I\\'m never speechless. Matt and Doug speak about Doug would like more stories on the Hunter Bidens. Now, on their own, these lapses could easily be interpreted as accidental but Malcolm did a podcast after the debate where he says he entered with this perspective. He is one of those English people, white English people, who objects to the number of non-white people who have moved to England in the last 50 years. I walked in thinking, he\\'s a piece of shit. This paints that little joke and those mistakes in a whole new light. It\\'s very likely that these were examples of covert sniping, a good-natured front for what was really a veiled attack. And after an hour, Douglas lets him know in his sarcastic tone that that is how he sees it. Now, early in an interaction, you will not be certain what\\'s driving these sorts of mistakes and behaviors. So rather than getting accusatory or immediately firing back, the best approach is to interpret ambiguous communications charitably and respond with warmth. We don\\'t get to see this in this debate but the show Ted Lasso is full of these examples. And yes, even though this is a fictional show, this strategy is extremely effective at flipping rudeness in real life. And of course, after repeat offenses, you should escalate and you can watch my video on Robert Downey Jr. to learn how to do that with charisma. But for now, we\\'re going to move to our second behavior to avoid which is strawmanning. That is, twisting the other person\\'s position to make it easier for you to attack. For context, Matt Taibbi refers to the 1950s as a time where Americans had more trust in reporters like Walter Cronkite because they had to speak to a broader audience than the niche reporting of the internet era requires. Gladwell hears this and responds like this. In that moment, the mainstream media was populated entirely by white men from elite schools. Why you would have had such affection and say that\\'s the gold standard and we should trust the mainstream media precisely at the moment when the mainstream media is least representative is really puzzling to me. And over the next hour or so, he brings this up repeatedly. I feel like there should be a giant picture of Walter Cronkite behind. Matt, I understand that you do have this wonderful nostalgia for the way things used to be. Matt, the answer is obvious. He would like if the world resembled 1955 again. Words tell me when somebody comes back and says, oh, no, no, no, there\\'s more to my great love of this man. With this direct and persistent twisting of your words, subtle responses will not be enough. So you need to directly state that the other person is strawmanning. You can say it gently like, hey, I think you\\'re misinterpreting my position or if it happens as frequently as it does in this debate, you can take Douglas Murray\\'s more confrontational approach. I\\'m going to try to take this more seriously than you did in your endless creation of strawman which just is ceaseless this evening. When you do this, just remember that if you actually want to reverse the situation, it helps to offer the other person a way to save face so that gentle approach is your best starting option. Now, strawmanning is frustrating but it\\'s fairly easy to catch but that\\'s not as true about our third behavior—overloading. That means insisting that the other person defend themselves from an accusation that isn\\'t relevant. And in this case, Malcolm points out that Douglas and Matt don\\'t seem to be in full agreement and then he says this. The two of you should really get together in the next five minutes and work out your story. These are obsessions of the non-mainstream media. Once again, work it out, guys. The implication that Douglas and Matt need to be in lockstep gets some of the biggest applause of the night from Malcolm and it\\'s why people use this tactic. It\\'s compelling to an audience and it can confuse the other person into defending an irrelevant point but Douglas handles this exactly the right way—the way that you should. He takes pride in not carrying unnecessary burdens. You\\'ve got to get your story right, guys. I know it\\'s easy for a cheap laugh line but I don\\'t see why we do. We\\'re two very different people with very different careers, interests, and much more and we don\\'t need to get our story straight for you or for this audience tonight or be in lockstep. Differences of opinion including on the same side used to be cherished. The key insight here is that if you slow down and you don\\'t knee-jerk react when you\\'re in an argument, you will see that much of what the opposing side says actually argues in your favor even if the person says it with a tone of superiority. For instance, if someone at your workplace says, Well, you disagree with my last idea. Why don\\'t you show me your perfect idea?\" You could simply reply, That\\'s exactly why I\\'m bringing my disagreement to you. I don\\'t have a perfect solution and I wanted to talk through our options. Now, to do this, you\\'re going to have to agree with someone who is attacking you. That takes a lot of composure and I\\'ll teach you how to maintain that under pressure in the last point. For now though, I want to give you a test to see if you can catch these opportunities now that you know what to look for. So see if you can catch what Malcolm could have said to this attack from Douglas. For context, Malcolm has been making comments about fact-checking. I think that you need to fact-check some of your nostalgic notions about the wonderful world of the 1950s. And then, Douglas attacks him like this. Given the topic of the debate and the agree and reframe tool we\\'re discussing, what would a powerful response be? I read your book, David and Goliath. The chapter on Northern Ireland is more filled with inaccuracies than any other chapter in a nonfiction book I have read. Did you catch that? Douglas is actually making Malcolm\\'s point because Malcolm\\'s book is not a mainstream news publication. It\\'s a great example of non-corporate media that does not have the same standards of fact-checking that Malcolm contends editorial rooms do. So the factual inaccuracies in Malcolm\\'s novels actually prove his point in this debate. Malcolm almost gets this but can\\'t quite see that the point is not just irrelevant but actually supports his position and he misses a great opportunity. I didn\\'t know that the function of this debate was to rehash the accuracy of a chapter in a book. Well, you were the one that started talking about fact-checkers. I\\'m simply saying, why don\\'t you employ some? I suspect. I suspect, Douglas. Now, admittedly, catching these in real time is very tough and that\\'s why the final point of this video is about how to calm your nervous system so that you\\'re actually getting these insights more and more effortlessly. But for now, we need to dive into one last destructive behavior and that is projecting bad faith. When someone accuses someone else as having biases that they are actually harboring. For instance, Malcolm closes with this summation of his opponents. Their concern to the mainstream media to the extent that they have told us what it is is filled with people who don\\'t think like they do and that fact makes them uncomfortable. Essentially, he\\'s accusing Douglas and Matt of writing off other perspectives without listening deeply because it threatens their ego. In that podcast from earlier, Malcolm says that he entered the debate with this perspective. To be honest, it began with a certain degree of arrogance that I thought I just couldn\\'t imagine how anyone could legitimately argue that the mainstream media was worse than the alternative. This is what I mean by projecting bad faith. It\\'s Malcolm who didn\\'t enter this debate with an open mind or the belief that he might encounter reasonable humans with a different opinion. Rather than acknowledge and own his prejudice, he blames his opponents for not engaging in good faith dialogue. His projection causes him to see the source of the problem outside of himself which makes it impossible for him to effectively address and this takes us to the most important takeaway because this is not about dunking on Malcolm. In your own life, in debates, arguments, and in all social interactions, things will go better when you can listen both to the other person so that you\\'re able to respond to their points and to your own feelings in real time. Malcolm can\\'t listen to Douglas or even to himself because he\\'s gotten triggered especially after that fact-checking exchange and you can see it in his body language. He crosses his arms and his legs in defense. He covers his face with his hands. He stares off blankly for a long, long time and he writes continuously while others are speaking. He\\'s left the room and he is really arguing with people who aren\\'t there. He\\'s arguing with the threats of his past in a fearful and defensive way which, to his credit, he actually acknowledges in that podcast. That dude, you know, people used to shout the N-word at my mom when she walked down the street in England in 1950 or whatever and in my mind, I\\'m imagining he\\'s one of those people. These counterproductive instincts occur in all of us when we get triggered. We shut down, close off, and move into behaviors that kept us safe in the past usually, fight, flight, freeze, or fawn. So the most important thing that I want you to take from this video is to notice when you lose your capacity to listen. That means noticing when you go into defensive postures, crossed arms, legs, or covering your face. It means noticing when you\\'re in your head planning a response rather than comfortably listening to the other person. It means noticing when you\\'ve lost track of your own upset feelings saying that you\\'re fine even when your heart and your mind are racing. All of those are signs that you can\\'t listen clearly which is a sign that you\\'ve been triggered out of the present moment. And you might be thinking, oh, well, those things happen to me all the time in social situations. That\\'s great. Nothing is wrong with you. It happens with me too. It just means that the part of you focused on keeping you safe from those past threats has taken control. So when this occurs, the best way to get back to your confident self isn\\'t any tactic at all. It\\'s simply to first notice that you\\'re in safety-seeking mode. No need for shame. Just notice it. Second, check if you\\'re actually okay. Chances are that you\\'re in a social scenario that might feel threatening but your physical body isn\\'t under attack. And then third, ask yourself what would feel really good right now. Maybe it\\'s stretching, apologizing for spacing out, asking a genuine question, or just letting out a big sigh. Sometimes, it\\'s realizing that you want to rip that other person\\'s head off and then laughing at yourself for your own toxicity. Regardless of what it is, when you shift your focus to feeling good rather than defending yourself, you can come back to the present moment where you\\'re able to effectively address whatever is happening in a cool, calm, collected way. And to feeling that confidence is important to you, you might be interested in our program, Charisma University. It\\'s a step-by-step 30-day program that tells you exactly what to do every day so that by the end of it, you are radiating confidence and charisma without even thinking about it. Here\\'s just a few things that our past members have said. I had confidence in some areas but not in others. Then, Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. Another member wrote, I\\'ve always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren\\'t one-on-one in conversations. I\\'d find myself hesitant to speak or I\\'d get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think. I feel much happier all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman I\\'ve had a crush on for about a year and made a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep going back to it when I need a refresher on the daily action modules. This program is literally guaranteed to change your life which means that you can take the entire course and if you don\\'t think it\\'s worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund right from inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"you never want your negotiations to end like this. It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this, I'll tell you. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. You don't have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us, you don't have any cards. But moments like this don't pop up out of nowhere. There were many common behaviors in the Trump-Zelensky press conference that made that meltdown likely and there were also some moments that were handled really well. So in this video, I want to break down what you can learn from this blow-up so that you win in high-stakes negotiations in your own life. To be clear, this is not about what Trump or Zelensky should do from a foreign policy perspective. I'm starting on the basis that Zelensky wants American weapons, money, and backing while Trump is signaling that he may not send it. I'm taking those starting positions as a given. What I want to focus on is what Zelensky could have done in a weak power position in the negotiation so that you learn what you could do to win in a negotiation where someone has something that you really want. But first, I want to weigh in on a common negotiation question — who do you want to make the first offer? Should it be you or them? I firmly believe that in negotiations, it is in your best interest that the other side make the initial offer. This is because, one, they might offer more than you hope for, and, two, it will direct you towards what they want out of this deal. In this case, Trump spelled out his desires immediately. We look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging and working and losing thousands of soldiers on both sides. We're losing a lot of soldiers and we want to see it stop and we want to see the money get put to different kinds of use like rebuilding. I will say that I'll say in front of you, you've heard me say it a thousand times, if I were president, this war would have never happened. We would have had a deal negotiated for you without having to go through what you've gone through. A rare-earth mineral deal, an end to the fighting so that money can be spent elsewhere, and credit as a peacemaker. So far, so good. Zelensky knows what Trump wants but he fumbles the next essential point which is to show how working with you gets the other side what they just said they want. Do not try to make the other side want something that they didn't say they wanted. Now, it's understandable that Zelensky would do this but instead of emphasizing what Trump wants, he makes it a point to show Trump photos of mistreated Ukrainian prisoners and he repeats over and over what Ukraine needs while saying almost nothing about what Trump wants. Of course, we need very much the air defense. You have the best air defense in the world and we need licenses for quick production. We need our nation to be calm that we are secure. For some, this is going to sound harsh but in a negotiation, you need to recognize that the other person does not want the things you do. Behaving like they care about what you need even if you need it badly isn't going to help you get it. Worse, emphasizing how bad your situation is, how desperate your need is, can sabotage your position and, unfortunately, that is what Zelensky did, highlighting that without America, there may be literally no other option for him because Europe wouldn't participate. Without the United States, they will not be ready to be as strong as we need and, of course, I'm sure that the United States president will not stop support. This is crucial for us. Later, when things blew up, Trump echoed that desperation that Zelensky showed him right back to him emphasizing that he had no choice without a U.S. deal. I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States and your people are very brave but you're either going to make a deal or we're out and if we're out, you'll fight it out. I don't think it's going to be pretty but you'll fight it out but you don't have the cards. So do not beg to get your needs met by the other person. Instead, listen for what the other side wants and show them that they can get that more effectively by working with you. Now, I'm not a foreign policy whiz but in this case, it might be something like showing Trump how a harder line with Russia, a demilitarized zone, weaponry, and NATO troops on the ground could get him the money in the form of minerals deal and the reputation as a great and powerful peacemaker. That would be speaking to what Trump has already said he wants while getting Zelensky what he needs without having to beg for it. Now, of course, it's not all about their perspective which brings us to the third point — you need to employ the friendly f*** no. This means you reveal your disagreements without budging but also without forcing their resolution. Now, this piece causes a lot of confusion. Some people think that you need to disagree loudly, make a display of strength so that you don't get pushed around. Others avoid disagreements and play nice to keep things flowing and friendly. The truth is you should disagree firmly when you can hit these three points. You make your position clear, you don't ask the other side to agree with your reasoning, and you do it in a friendly manner. Zelensky does that beautifully here. Our friends and our very supportive partners, they really gave a lot, Mr. President. They did. But they gave much less. No. Much less. No. No. No. But pushing back in other ways is doomed to be totally ineffective. This occurs when you're not just revealing where you disagree but asking the other person to agree with your point of view of how and why you arrived there. Zelensky falls into this ineffective negotiating habit as he repeatedly points out that Russia invaded seemingly hoping that Trump will agree with him that they're wrong for doing it. You know, think of the parents. Whether they're in Russia or Ukraine, think of the parents of all these people being killed needlessly. They came to our territory. Should have never started. If I were president... President speaks about the people and the soldiers which are dying but they came to our territory. They came to our land. They began this war and they have to stop. This can be a tough pill to swallow but in many negotiations, you will have to accept that the other party is going to walk away with a different story than you. This occurred as I negotiated with my co-founder to buy out Charisma on Command. We disagreed as to who had contributed the likely future and basically, we were living in different stories. What I learned from that was that trying to get him to agree to my story or vice versa derailed things entirely but when we allowed one another to have different stories and focused instead on how to move forward, we quickly got to a deal that worked for both of us. So do not try to change the other side's story. Focus instead on what you can exchange and what you can enforce. For Zelensky, this could be dropping that attempt to get Trump to blame Putin or feel bad about the Ukrainian prisoners which is all story and instead, focusing exclusively on getting him to take concrete steps to protect Ukraine and return those prisoners. Now, we get to the part where things break down. Vance talks about diplomacy with Russia and Zelensky has an issue with his suggesting that diplomacy is even a viable route. The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy. We signed the exchange of prisoners but he didn't do it. What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean? I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. This was a huge mistake on Zelensky's part because not only is he trying to get Vance to agree with his point of view which, for the record, I totally get his desire to do that, he's wasting his time negotiating with someone who isn't the decision maker. Just don't do this. Now, we make fun of it sometimes but the Karen technique of asking for a manager is exactly what you should do here in your life. You don't argue with the frontline employee without power. You ask immediately to speak with the person who can make decisions. Unfortunately, Zelensky gets into it with Vance instead of the guy who actually runs the show. Now, to his credit, Zelensky remains very calm here but it's this unnecessary conflict that creates the shouting match with him and Trump. You have a nice ocean and don't feel now but you will feel it in the future. You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel. I'm not telling you because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position. At this point, things are going off the rails. Trump and Zelensky are talking over each other. No one is getting through. Trump's leaning in and touching Zelensky several times to make him stop talking. Vance tells him that he needs to say thank you. In this entire meeting, have you said thank you? And Trump ends the exchange with the patented, excuse me. Now, obviously, this isn't what you would ever want were you in Zelensky's position. Your blood would probably be boiling from being spoken to like that. I know mine would. But there is a way to recover from these moments and it's not some hard-nosed negotiating tactic or devastating comeback but I swear it really, really works. It's to ask a genuine question about the other side's feelings. For instance, what do you feel that I haven't fully understood here or what is it that you're most wanting from this deal? Most people cringe at these questions but you need to realize that these questions concede nothing. The only thing you let go of is your need to be seen and heard in that moment. It's about releasing pride. This is one of the hardest things for most people and it can be your greatest advantage in negotiations because most people negotiate in part to get their feelings validated. We saw that Trump wants to be seen like the peacekeeper and if you can drop your need for the other side to validate your feelings and how you see yourself while being willing to validate theirs, it gives you a powerful negotiating chip. Now, it's not the same power as tons of money or tanks or bombs but in uneven negotiations where you feel like you need this deal, this can tip things in your favor. And just to be clear, validating doesn't mean agreeing to the other side's worldview or reducing your ask. You can remain completely firm. It just means that you hear them and reflect back that their desires are important. That didn't happen though and Trump kind of pointed as to why. It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this. It's going to be very hard to succeed in a negotiation or any business deal when you have unprocessed contempt for the other side. And while he was outwardly deferential for much of the conversation, the eye-rolling and other nonverbal signals Zelensky's contempt and frustration with Trump throughout this conversation. And to be clear, it wasn't like Trump held back with his contempt. Then you tell us, I don't want to cease fire. I don't want to cease fire. I want to go and I wanted this. But in a negotiation, you can't control the other side. You can only do your own work to get the outcome that is best for you and I think this prior emotional processing was what Zelensky most missed. He came in wanting Trump to be someone other than he is. He hadn't processed the pain and frustration and anger that he felt at Trump's approach which had been telegraphed for weeks beforehand. Because he didn't feel his feelings about Trump's approach, a combination of wishful thinking and frustration led Zelensky to behave in ways that didn't best suit his interests. So before a negotiation, it can be extremely helpful to imagine the other person doing exactly the upsetting thing that it looks like they're going to do and to scream your head off at them privately. This lets you process your feelings beforehand rather than having them leak out passive-aggressively. Now, there's something that happened off-screen that would be criminal to leave out. Zelensky met with European leaders the following weekend which is the most important piece behind every tactic that will occur on the day of the negotiation because 95% of powerful negotiation is having a second option that you're happy with. He who cares less wins and he who has a great plan B will care less. So talking with Europe is a good move for Zelensky. If he's able to make up the Americans' contribution from them which is admittedly a very tall order, it will help his position tremendously. The good news for you is that in your life, there's almost always more than one option to get your needs met. So remember, if you're ever feeling pinched or stuck in a negotiation, the best strategy isn't to talk more cleverly but to develop a plan B that you're genuinely excited for. And it's also worth pointing out that walking out on a deal is really not a problem. Inexperienced negotiators will freak out at this which makes them weak and unable to draw boundaries but as long as you can do the no-deal option without angrily blaming the other person to their face, there usually isn't a problem. Now, the whole Fox interview after was a mixed bag strategically for Zelensky but these parts exemplify what you want to do in a no-deal walkout situation. That is, say thank you for the opportunity to discuss, express respect for the other person, and if you do say sorry, it's usually only sorry that things didn't work out with a hope to find another way that works for both parties. I'm very thankful to Americans for all your support. You did a lot. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress bipartisan support. From you, Mr. President, I thought that you owe the president an apology. No, I respect the president and I respect American people. Remembering that you can walk out and then come back later as long as you do all of that respectfully will help you avoid many bad deals and if someone gives you an offer that they threaten to take off the table without you having the chance to think on it privately, that's usually a good sign you don't want it anyway so walking is fine. Now, all of this has been about hard power — how to operate in a world of concrete exchange but there is a lot of life and business that is about soft power. That's operating in the world of social exchange where people get jobs, dates, raises, and other opportunities not because they negotiate hard but because people like them and want to be around them. So if you'd like to master your soft power skills to reap those benefits, you might want to join Charisma University. It's our step-by-step 30-day course to make confidence easy to tap into in any moment so that people and opportunities naturally gravitate to you. Here's what one member had to say about the soft skills that he took from the course. I highly recommend Charisma on Command to any people, professionals, or businesses looking to add practical edge in the world of soft skills and relationship building in both professional and personal situations. The training videos are super easy to follow. The summaries are easy to note down and make very efficient for easy following. One of my best investments in personal growth and leadership training — beautiful, simple, and lifelong lessons. This person transformed his job search to make it work for him. I must confess that the course has been life-changing for me. I aced all of my interviews and had several options to choose from. I now feel much more comfortable at networking events and I can easily make fruitful connections. I'm also the guy who links others together which I think is an even more rewarding feeling. I highly recommend this course and it's been a remarkably transformative journey for me. Finally, this person used it to get a job that was originally looking for more experienced candidates. I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet they want me to fill this position and when I asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills which is rare for an engineer. You can think quickly on your feet and you're open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you have taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. Now, if you do join the course, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all and it's 60 days even though the course only takes 30 because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Recently, Steven Crowder and Ethan Klein got together to discuss the pros and cons of listening to the CDC. Somehow, that conversation turned into this. Ethan, how can you respect yourself as a man, brother? You believe in something so strongly that you're not willing to take it. Stop showing your little leprechaun colors. Right, right. Hey, Ethan, Ethan, come on, Ethan. Yikes. So in today's video, we're going to break down how that conversation got so heated and what you can learn from it. Specifically, we'll go over five common habits you may have that are making friends dislike you when you argue. We'll also go over some positive ways you can be more persuasive and make people like you even during a disagreement. As always, this is not a criticism of Steven or Ethan as people. It's just a teachable moment to help you in arguments you may have in the future. Okay, so how did things get to that point? The conversation actually starts out surprisingly cordial. Hey, Ethan, how you doing, brother? Hey, I just want to say on a serious note that I'm glad your wife is okay. I heard you had a little bit of an issue with your wife. Well, she's pregnant with twins. So it's like, well, by the way, congratulations, too. I know you guys are in the same process. It's only after Steven launches into his first question about trusting the CDC that things go south. Check it out. I think people should think about it, I believe. And we talked about this through Playful Ribbing and an aggregation of medical authorities and scientific voices to make an informed and rational decision. So where do you think that I'm wrong on that? Ethan's response doesn't really make sense without context. So here's some quick background for you. Steven has a sponsorship with Spartan Armor Systems. Ethan's opinion of Steven is that he dislikes gay people and is ducking a debate with a guy named Sam Cedar. Now, given that info, watch how Ethan responds to that question about the CDC. Steven, do you know that the Spartans are that they are like practice man love with children? Oh, geez. OK, so this is what's going to happen. I what did I tell you? He was going to do anything he could to avoid. Oh, oh, there he is. Oh, no, Sam Cedar. What a what a nightmare. The mistake Ethan makes here if you care to persuade the person you're talking with is aiming for a gotcha moment. Ha, gotcha. You have got me. You have got me. Gotcha moments are attempts to make someone look stupid. When you try to make someone look stupid, you're no longer working together to examine the truth of a claim. Instead, you make the argument a game of social dominance. Watch Ethan and Sam's reaction once the conversation with Steven ends. Do you get the sense that their goal was to explore whether or not listening to the CDC makes sense? Or do you get the sense that this was about social dominance? We got him. He admitted that he watched the show last week. We got him. Dude, we played him so hard. They're celebrating but as you'll see in a minute, the conversation was very unproductive. No one learned anything new. No one changed their mind. No audience members are better informed about the CDC. In your own life, it will be very tempting when discussing something in front of other people to go for gotcha moments or make the other person look stupid. This feeds your ego in the moment because it makes you feel superior but it doesn't make friends or change anyone's mind. That's why the Socratic method is so powerful. Rather than try to convince someone of something, you respectfully guide them with questions and let them convince themselves. The difference between a gotcha question and a respectful question comes through in tone and pacing. You want a slow cadence and a non-aggressive tone with genuine upward inflection. Here's a good example with Trevor Noah after the 2016 election. Now, I would like to know from your side genuinely as someone who's won, do you believe that Donald Trump will follow through on his promises? Getting back to learning from Stephen and Ethan, Stephen actually had a great opportunity here. He could have called out Ethan and Sam for bringing Sam without telling him ahead of time but then done the debate anyway despite feeling lied to. If his argument holds up under scrutiny, he comes off great and gets to educate all three of their audiences. Instead, we quickly see the next two common mistakes people make in arguments. I don't know if this was the case with Stephen but these two mistakes in particular come out in most people when their emotions get the best of them. The first is incredibly common — it's to repeatedly talk over someone. Talking over someone once may just be a sign you're excited to make your point but if you find yourself talking over someone repeatedly, it can be a sign that you're emotionally triggered because you're unwilling to allow the other person to finish their point. Here's another example. When you feel the urge to cut someone off or if you feel your heartbeat escalate or your breathing get shallow and rushed, pause and take one deep breath. It sounds cliche but your nervous system has put you into fight or flight. You need to calm it down so you can respond rationally rather than emotionally. If not, you're very likely to make the next common mistake — an ad hominem attack. An ad hominem is an argument directed against a person rather than their position in the argument. So in this case, it would be anything unrelated to the CDC. Here's a quick example. This is extremely common and often a sign of fear. People turn to ad hominem when they're afraid they'll lose the actual argument. The worst form of this is straight-up insults. The plan was to talk about the CDC and now we're talking about his eyes. This may work when you're in front of an audience that already likes you but it will make the person you're arguing with hate you. It's also likely to lead to them resorting to ad hominem attacks as well. Eventually, you just get arguments like this next clip that are awful to be a part of. Nothing productive can happen with this much hostility. Contrast that with how Russell Brand begins this disagreement with Bill Maher. This is far more persuasive. A genuine compliment before you disagree opens someone up to be receptive to ideas they didn't hold previously. Here's another example of Russell speaking with Ben Shapiro. When it comes to the disagreement itself, the ideal way to be persuasive in an argument is the exact opposite of an ad hominem attack. Rather than attacking their character, separate the person you're talking to from their viewpoint. This gives them the chance to change their mind without feeling their identity is under attack. Here's a great example from Jordan Peterson. Did you notice how he says, the problem I have with your argument and not the problem I have with you? You can take this one step further by saying that argument instead of your argument. Here's a similar example from Russell Brand and Ben Shapiro. I agree with you. Sometimes when I hear you criticize what in my view are people that are less powerful, this is where I find myself not in alignment with your perspective. I say this with respect. No, this is a really important idea and I want to get into it. Russell does two good things in the span of 15 seconds. First, he highlights where he agrees with Ben. Then he keeps Ben's ego unthreatened by saying he disagrees with his perspective rather than him. Again, even better would be that perspective. By using phrases like that argument or that perspective, you separate the position from the person. The rule to remember is this. If you want someone to be receptive to new ideas, you need to keep their ego feeling unthreatened. This next common mistake is an obvious one so we'll cover it quickly but it's important to note because people will hate you when you do it to them. Strawmanning. Here's a quick example with Sam Harris and Ben Affleck. First, watch Sam lay out his point. The crucial point of confusion is that we have been sold this meme of Islamophobia where every criticism of the doctrine of Islam gets conflated with bigotry toward Muslims as people. Now watch Ben Affleck completely mischaracterize that point just a few seconds later. You're saying that Islamophobia is not a real thing. If you want to persuade the person you're speaking with and make them like you more, do the exact opposite of this. Ask yourself, what is the most intelligent charitable way I can make their point for them? Then reiterate that point back confirming they feel it accurately represents their point of view before you argue against it. Ultimately, all of these points come down to one dangerous yet common habit most people have when disagreeing with someone. They're unwilling to consider that they may in fact be on the wrong side. You want to trade your I want to win mindset for an I want to learn if I'm wrong mindset. Immediately, you'll find you don't do any of these bad habits because you'll interpret arguments as opportunities to test ideas and see which one stands up best under scrutiny. Your goal is no longer to show you were right coming into the discussion. It's to leave believing something that's true. And there's an added persuasive benefit to this mindset. By not positioning the person who came in with the right idea as the winner, you allow people to change their minds without feeling like they lost. Persuasion happens when people feel like they're both on the same team in search of finding the truth together. Not that he's perfect, but this is the mindset that allows Russell to have multiple incredibly cordial conversations with Ben Shapiro despite their political differences. He describes it well here. You know, but I'm in a sort of an open space where I feel that what I want to do is understand you and be giving to you and generous to you, even though as we have both listed and are both surely aware, there are loads of stuff that we would disagree on. Okay, so what do you do if you do accidentally get into a social dominance game? It's happened to all of us. You went in trying to have a thoughtful discussion, but it devolved into an argument that went nowhere. You probably walked away frustrated thinking the other person is an idiot. Now what? It's time for projection reflection. This is something the average person struggles with, but it's also one of the greatest levers of personal development and self-improvement. First, sit down and write out all your criticisms of the person you just argued with. Maybe they were stubborn or rude or shouted over you. Then reflect on the ways that you were guilty of the same behavior. For example, remember that Ethan agreed to debate Steven and then tagged out without mentioning it beforehand? You may see some irony in what he says to Steven after Steven won't debate Sam Cedar. Steven similarly calls Ethan a coward for not debating him while denying to debate Sam. So if you find yourself complaining about the other side, pause and reflect on if this critique really only describes the other side. Often the things that aggravate us the most about other people are the things we don't like about ourselves that we are pretending aren't there. Here's one more quick example with Steven and Ethan. It's easy to criticize and demonize the other side. What's harder is to recognize that you may be guilty of similar behavior. One of the best things you can do for your personal growth and happiness is take your critiques of other people and use them to investigate if there's an area in yourself you'd benefit from changing. There's one last weird psychology observation from all this drama that's worth touching on. Fans from both sides watch the same video and each is wholly convinced that their guy came away looking great and the other guy looks like an idiot. How can they come away with such different impressions from the same video? If you ever find yourself in a position where you and someone else watch the same video or read the same article but come away with strong yet opposite opinions, it's a good potential warning sign that your view may be compromised by pre-existing bias or tribalism. Just something to be aware of in yourself.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"If you can't tell when someone is lying, it opens you up to being manipulated, cheated on, or stolen from and having no idea until it's too late. So in today's video, we'll go through 9 tricks to spot a liar. We'll do this by breaking down some clips of actors lying about the movie Spider-Man No Way Home. Fair warning, there will be minor spoilers. Now, this may surprise you, but most unpracticed liars actually try to avoid outright lying. Watch this quick clip of Tom Holland to see what I mean and notice his body language. Any chance there's a multiverse in which Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man, and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man, and your Spider-Man all meet together? Clashing? And then you can sort of just say that everyone just comes from a different universe. But would you want that, though? Would you want that? Maybe that's a better question. But would we want that? Tom tries to avoid lying by avoiding answering at all. But while it's easy to hold back your words, it's much harder to hide your micro-expressions. In this case, Tom fidgets with his hands, which could be a sign that the question makes him nervous. He's also fighting back a smile. When someone's trying to hide something they're excited about, it's not uncommon to see a quick, repressed smile. There's also a darker, more sinister smile that you may see when someone's lying to you. It's known as Duper's Delight, a quick smile that comes from the thrill of deceiving you. This next clip is of a mother who killed her own children in an interview from before she was the suspect. Notice how out of place her smile is given her words. When I go to bed, I cry at night. Even now, I still cry. I dream about Cheryl. That is a bizarre sentence to say with a smile. Look for it again in this next clip. She's talking about how much she allegedly loved her children. Yet, she has to fight back a smile right after she lies and says, they took it from me. They give me satisfaction. They give me stability. They give me a reason to live and a reason to be happy and that's gone. They took it from me. But children are so easy to conceive. If you see someone bite back a smile when it seems inappropriate, you may have caught Duper's Delight. Some other signs to look for are increased blinking, rapid shallow breathing, a leg shaking, or hard swallows. But before you assume someone is lying based on their body language, it is extremely important to establish a baseline of their normal behavior first. This is why FBI investigators will start with questions completely unrelated to the case. You need to understand what someone looks like normally before you can catch them lying. So to dive into the next way to spot a lie, let's start by looking at an honest answer from Andrew Garfield just to establish a baseline for how he acts during interviews. Have you seen the trailer? I know you're a Spider-Man fan because we've talked about when you were Spider-Man, but have you seen the trailer to this new one? I have and I'm excited and I think that Tom Holland is just the perfect Peter Parker and Spider-Man. You saw there he answered definitively and with no hesitation. Now contrast that with this next clip when he's asked if he's in Spider-Man No Way Home. Photo going around on the internet of you and Tobey Maguire on the set of Spider-Man. Yeah, the new Spider-Man movie. And I was like, wow, I'm not sure about that. Andrew gives a soft response with way less conviction than normal. He's also hesitating and dragging out his words, which are both ways to buy time to figure out what to say next. A soft denial alone doesn't prove someone's lying, but he quickly follows up with another sign of lying, deception testing. Deception testing is when someone changes the details of their story as they try to find the most convincing lie. As an example, listen to how Andrew first answers this next question. Have you seen the photo? What are you talking about? Well, if you show me the photo, I can tell you whether it's me or whether it's a real thing. It's been erased. It's been erased. So that's his first try. Then he realizes it's unrealistic he wouldn't have seen such a viral photo of himself. So he changes his story. Yeah, yeah, it's been erased, but it was around and we all saw it. And I heard about it and I did see it and it's a Photoshop. In your own life, when you suspect someone is lying, ask them questions that get them to repeat different aspects of their story and then take note of what details change. When this soft denial on Jimmy Fallon didn't convince people, Andrew actually switched to Tom's approach and avoided answering at all. This Spider-Man Photoshop thing that we talked about on Jimmy Fallon. Listen, at this point, people just like, I'm done. Like, we'll find out when the movie comes out. This is a strategy you may see in your own life. Someone will act annoyed by a question in order to avoid answering the question. Take it as a red flag if someone tries to get you to stop asking questions by making you feel like the bad guy for asking them. In addition to a soft response, you also want to look out for what's called an indirect response. So again, just have something to compare to. Take a look at this clip from Emma Stone. This is a direct denial. There also are rumors that you're going to be involved. Have you heard these rumors? I have heard those rumors. I don't know if I'm supposed to say anything, but I'm not. That's what Andrew said, too. So you're in good company. Okay, okay, cool. But you're supposed to respond as an alumnus. You saw a change of tone, but she gives a very straightforward, no, I'm not. Compare that to Andrew who uses an analogy to avoid directly saying he isn't in the movie. I feel like I'm in a game of fucking werewolf or mafia where I'm like, I'm not the werewolf. I promise you I am not the werewolf. And everyone's like, you're the werewolf. You're the fucking werewolf. One indirect response on its own isn't always a tell, but keep an eye out for if someone will only give you indirect responses. For the record, my friend, on a stack of whatever you have there, you are not, as of this taping, in or have any knowledge of being in the next Spider-Man movie. I feel like, like, I feel, I feel like, like, haven't I just said that? You also probably noticed he stammers in his answer, which he doesn't normally do. See if you can spot the next sign of deception yourself. Since we've isolated it to this clip, it should be obvious. I want to get really clear. I want, this is the unequivocal yes, no answer. I did not get a call. Does that sound familiar? I did not have sexual relations with that woman. We'll call this the Bill Clinton method. It's when someone technically tells the truth while they're trying to deceive you. In Bill's case, he argued sexual relations didn't include receiving oral sex. In Andrew's case, maybe he found out from his agent via text or email. In either case, if someone uses slippery language or answers a question other than the one you asked, it should make your ears perk up. There's one more sign most people don't consider when trying to spot a lie, and that is a bigger laugh than normal, especially when it's in response to a question. Again, it's all about comparison to baseline. Let's compare two laughs from Andrew Garfield. First, a genuine laugh, and second, an over-the-top laugh. If anything ever happened to you during a live performance where there was a mess up where you're like, this is going to be tough to work through. We know what's up. Do you know what's up? What I'm telling you is, you're in the new Spider-Man, no way home. On its own, a big laugh doesn't automatically mean someone is hiding something. Maybe they just found it funny. But it should pique your curiosity if you see a big laugh after a sensitive question. Big laughs before a lie happen for two reasons — to release nervous tension and to stall while they think of a response. The last potential tell to look for is shrinking body language. This can be things like hunching forward, looking down, or hiding your hands. In Andrew's case, you see him look down a lot in interviews when talking about Spider-Man, no way home. But he does this in other interviews as well. So while avoiding eye contact could mean someone is hiding something, in Andrew's case, it's more of an overall habit. That's something in general that you want to be aware of. A lot of these tells that make you look like a liar could just come from a lack of confidence. Speaking hesitantly and without conviction, looking down, fidgeting — no one thing in this video guarantees that someone is lying. But if you catch several of these in the same conversation, let it be a red flag. Now, on the other side of things, if these are nervous habits you worry you might have, especially in moments like when you're talking to someone you really admire or are very attracted to, then you may like our program, Charisma University. It has a one-week step-by-step guide specifically designed to help you build strong, confident body language habits and another one-week guide to help you build a deep, unshakable confidence you'll feel even in situations that used to make you nervous. Overall, it is the fastest way I know of to become more confident and charismatic. You can read all the details in the link below, but I figure the best way to let you know what the program is about is to have past members speak for themselves. So here are just a few things that people have written in. The first is from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, Another person wrote in about their social life, saying, I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system. And this last one is from someone who says it's been life-changing. Your course has been life-changing. To the point where I wake up in the morning feeling like I've transferred to a new person's body, the person I kept dreaming about becoming before I found Charisma on Command. It is incredible. I've found myself and I've found what makes me happy. If you're interested in learning more about this program, you can check out the link in the description below. I've found myself and I've found what makes me happy. If you want to join, but you're not sure if it's right for you, you should know it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. It's 60 days, even though the whole course is only 30 days, because we want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting massive value from the course.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, we'll show you four early signs that your relationship is secretly heading towards this. Every day I wake up and I hope you're dead! Okay, maybe not that extreme. But Dr. John Gottman has developed a model that can watch you talk to your partner and then predict with 90% accuracy if your relationship will end. He does this mostly by looking for four common communication mistakes. So today, we'll go over each one and the four antidotes that can save your relationship if you or your partner have these bad habits. The first bad habit is extremely common. It's criticism. Oh, you can't be serious. I'm dead serious. You're psychotic. You're hyperbolic. There's a difference between criticism and a complaint. A healthy complaint points to a specific behavior you don't like. It will look something like this. Why didn't you call? Why didn't you call me? Criticism is when you go beyond addressing a specific behavior and attack your partner's character or personality. Have you been doing this the entire time? Are you that insecure? Are you so insecure that you have to pull that crap? You're being so much like your father. Do not compare me to my father! I didn't compare you to him. I said you were acting like him. If you or your partner let your complaints turn into criticisms, you will slowly kill your relationships. Unfortunately, this is a very common mistake. This next movie clip is a good example of how that shift from complaint to criticism can happen. Let me see if I'm following this, okay? Are you telling me that you're upset because I don't have a strong desire to clean dishes? No, I'm upset because you don't have a strong desire to offer to do the dishes. I just did! After I asked you! Jesus, Brooke, you're acting crazy again. Don't you call me crazy! So far, these examples are all purposely extreme so you can see what it looks like on the far end. But not all criticism is this obvious. One subtle way that criticism can enter a relationship is by speaking in absolutes. Key phrases to watch for are never or always. When you use those words to describe something your partner does to upset you, you are prioritizing making them feel bad over addressing the behavior that's upsetting you. The next few clips are very dramatic because they're from movies and TV shows. In your own life, you want to watch out for sentences like these even if they're delivered without yelling. You always take advice from people besides your wife to be. You always made me aware of what I was doing wrong, how I was falling short! What? You think that I nag you? That's all you do! All you do is nag me! Criticism is a poison that slowly kills relationships. But that doesn't mean that repressing your complaints is the key to a happy relationship. In fact, this is almost guaranteed to lead to resentment and eventually a big fight. So how can you express that you don't like something in a way that's healthy and doesn't slowly destroy your relationship? The facts and feelings method. Using a calm tone, speak to a specific instance they can't deny. Like not doing the dishes yesterday. And rather than label them something negative, explain how that behavior made you feel. Here's an example that's a little too vague on the specifics, but nails it in terms of tone and focusing on her feelings. When we argue, like the things that you can say really upsets me when you say that kind of stuff. One thing you want to watch out for here is the false feelings trap. This is where you or your partner say, I feel followed by a negative judgment. This is not actually expressing an emotion. It's a criticism in disguise. I feel like you is the sneaky phrase most often used. The second sign your relationship won't last is contempt. Of the four behaviors we'll cover today, this is the single greatest predictor that a breakup is coming. If you see this in your partner, run. And if you see this in yourself, kill this habit before it kills your relationship. Contempt has three common ways it gets expressed. Disrespect, disgust, or superiority. The most obvious example of contempt is name-calling. For a quick example, watch how this woman reacts to her boyfriend telling her that he's scared of heights and doesn't want to do a canyon swing. If you see this type of name-calling in your relationship, it's very likely doomed. Another example of contempt is if your partner frames you as inferior. Look out for phrases like, that's the difference between you and me. This next clip is a good example, although again in your life, you'll likely see this without as much yelling. A more subtle version of superiority is if they consistently act like you're embarrassing them. Your relationship isn't doomed if one of you ever feels embarrassed by something the other one says or does. But if someone's reaction to feeling embarrassed is to scoff, roll their eyes, or tell you you're being childish, that could be a sign that their embarrassment is a mask for superiority or contempt. One last example of contempt you might see in your relationship is put-down sarcasm, like this joke where the punchline is Ross's failed marriages. The show is fiction, but unfortunately, these jokes where people attack something you're sensitive about are all too real in many relationships. Another example would be sarcasm where the underlying message is that someone in the relationship isn't a capable person. Good sarcasm lets you laugh along with it. If you feel hurt, it may not be that you're sensitive, it may be that there's contempt behind the joke. Contempt has even more subtle nonverbal ways it shows itself, like eye-rolling, sneering, and scoffing. The opposite of contempt is appreciation. If you want a relationship that's full of love and lasts a lifetime, then purposely build the habit of telling people what you appreciate about them, and filter for a partner who's good at sharing what they appreciate about you. For example, Robert Downey Jr. is notorious for being sarcastic in interviews, but listen to how he talks about his wife. This doesn't mean you can't be sarcastic, but you want your sarcasm to communicate love. For example, watch how Michelle Obama uses sarcasm to launch into a compliment. In a healthy relationship, expressing appreciation creates mutual appreciation and makes your partner more likely to respond in kind. Without mutual appreciation, it can be extremely easy to fall into the third habit that kills relationships, defensiveness. Defensiveness is when you attempt to make your partner feel bad for something they've said instead of addressing the thing itself. This makes it almost impossible to fix an otherwise fixable issue in your relationship. One way you may see this is with righteous indignation. Here's a quick example from La La Land. Emma Stone's character is trying to help Ryan Gosling's character. She isn't going about it kindly, and so, rather than consider her point, Ryan's character gets defensive and attacks her back. If you match aggression with aggression, it will almost always escalate a conflict. Instead, use an easy three-step process of de-escalation. Pause, take a deep, slow breath, and answer in a purposely calm, low voice. Another common example of defensiveness is reverse blame. Let's say one partner promised to make dinner and forgot. When asked what happened, you can take ownership for your mistake, or you can defensively say, well, you forgot to take the trash out last week. What you're saying may be true, but it doesn't help heal the relationship or get your needs met. It just further erodes the partnership. It may feel like two wrongs make a right, but what they don't do is help heal a relationship. The antidote to defensiveness is accepting responsibility. That doesn't mean you need to apologize or admit to things you didn't do. It means own your part in the conflict. The show Desperate Housewives actually does a good job of showing what this can look like. Defensiveness escalates a conflict because you're denying the other person's reality. Calmly accepting responsibility to the extent you can do so honestly helps to de-escalate a conflict and make the other person feel heard and understood. Now, if your relationship has criticism, contempt, and defensiveness in it, it can result in the last relationship-destroying habit, stonewalling. Stonewalling is when someone withdraws emotionally from a conversation. This can include things like shutting down, going silent, or walking away when your partner says something you don't like. A common misconception about stonewalling is that the person doing it has given up or doesn't care anymore. But the real reason they emotionally disengage might be that they're emotionally overwhelmed, so they shut down to protect themselves. If you do feel the instinct to stonewall, the solution isn't to force yourself to stay in a situation that's not yours. Force yourself to stay in a situation that's hurting you. Emotional overwhelm is real and it will make you make bad decisions, say things you don't mean, or otherwise hurt a relationship you care about. So the healthy alternative is to call a time-out. When you feel yourself getting overwhelmed and wanting to shut down or run away, tell your partner. Then ask for a 20-minute break from the conversation. You can resume it when you're ready. This next clip is again from a fictional TV show, but it does a surprisingly good job of showing what a healthy time-out can look like. Pause. Unpause. Unpause. One important note here, don't spend the time-out planning out what you're going to say. That will just keep you in that heightened emotional state of fighting. Spend that 20 minutes focusing on clearing your head and de-escalating your emotions. Now, throughout this video, you've seen some pretty extreme examples, and you might be thinking, why does anyone stay in a relationship where there's regularly fighting, tears, or emotional disconnection? The first reason this happens is because these bad habits build over time. They start out small and infrequent, but if you don't cure them quickly, they get worse and worse. In a relationship spanning multiple decades, this can end up getting really ugly. The second reason is because deep down at a subconscious level, most people are scared they'll end up alone. They lack the confidence to end bad relationships, or they lack the charisma to attract great people. So they settle and marry the wrong person, never finding someone that truly makes them happy. If that resonates with you and you want to avoid that fate, you may like our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in just 30 days. Now, you can read all the details in the link in the description below, but I figure the best way to let you know what it's about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few things that past members have said. I was at a low point of my life when I began the course, suffering from heartbreak. The trifecta of healing myself was exercise, therapy, and Charisma University. Whereas before, I was always one of the most socially awkward within a group, I am now one of, if not the, most charismatic and confident. And I'm only a little over halfway through the course. I am significantly more confident in all social situations. The connection I feel with strangers and close friends and family has increased dramatically. I transitioned from someone who never got asked to hang out regularly to multiple people texting me on a daily basis. I've grown so much because of this course, and I cannot thank you enough. I had confidence in some areas, but not in others. Then Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. It has had a far bigger impact on me than any traditional class I've ever enrolled in. You'll see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. And if you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. We make it 60 days, even though the course is only 30 days, because we want to make sure that you truly feel like you're getting a ton of value from the course. If you want to check it out, click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it, and I would love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video, and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 715}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Joe Rogan is so good in conversation, he just got $100 million to license his podcast to Spotify. And a big part of Joe's success comes from his ability to command respect from a broad range of people, from fighters to movie stars to academics. For an example of the kind of respect he commands from people, check out this clip of him and Jordan Peterson. You're a lot smarter than anyone might think, which is quite interesting. So you're a weird combination because, you know, your persona doesn't shout intellectual, but you're damn smart and you're tough as a bloody boot and you ask really provocative questions. Now, most of the time, respect is something you have to earn over time. But in this video, we're going to go over four things you can do in conversation to immediately command more respect from the people around you. And while Joe may be helped by factors like the way he looks and his fame, the habits we're about to discuss will work for anyone who tries them. The first thing that we'll just touch on briefly that immediately helps Joe command respect is the way he speaks. As an example, listen to him discuss the physical difference between men and women in sports. Most sports involve speed and power. We have an entire video on how to create an attractive voice, so I'll link to that at the end of this video and I won't touch on the strength or timbre of his voice. But three things you'll notice with Joe that help him instantly command respect is he does not rush, he emphasizes his words, and he uses pauses between words to hold your attention. Now, compare that to Adam Conover, who he's debating at that moment. I was talking to some people about this. And in sports, not to pick on Adam here, but that moment is a nice example. If you use filler words like that, it can make you seem either uncomfortable or afraid that if you stop talking, you won't get to finish your thought. There are tactical things you can do vocally to command more respect, like putting emphasis on your last word. But the most important thing is your mindset. If you can remove the fear that you may lose someone's interest or get cut off, you will naturally start to speak more slowly and with more presence. Joe is able to do this incredibly well because he does not allow other people to derail him if he has something important to say. We've all known someone who regularly gets steamrolled in conversation. It makes them look meek even if they're a good person who potentially has interesting things to say. Joe refuses to let that happen if he's sharing something important to him. For example, watch in this clip as Joe confronts Jamie Kilstein about challenging someone to a fight over a political disagreement. And you said you would like to enact violence on him and kickbox with him. You know he's not skillful at it. Agreed upon. Agreed upon kickboxing. That's not fair at all. Not jumping him in an alley. Even if he's 100 pounds heavier than you, if you're a skilled fighter and you are and you've been training for a long time. This unfazed delivery is a great way to handle it the first time someone tries to interrupt you. He does this again later in the interview, ironically, while talking about Daniel Tosh being interrupted by a heckler. A 100% uncensored ride through the mind and imagination of Daniel Tosh not to be interrupted by a moron. And when that moron does interrupt with something completely non-ironic. Ridiculous. But sometimes simply continuing to speak isn't enough to stop someone from interrupting you. So in certain situations where you feel the person has repeatedly tried to cut you off, you can call it out like Joe does here. Not only is it not fair, it's kind of creepy. Hold on a second, man. For real. As a martial artist, you're not picking on another martial artist. Importantly, notice that he doesn't yell. It's important to remain calm when you call out the interruption. This is a great way to take control of a situation if things have gotten a bit heated. For instance, in his interview with Milo Yiannopoulos, Joe and Milo are constantly interrupting each other. But by calling it out, Joe takes command of the conversation and Milo shows respect for the call-out by ceding the floor to Joe. Do you think there's the only way that a person can have ethics and morals and treat each other well? No, I didn't say the only way. I said this specifically. Listen, if we're going to have a conversation, we can't keep talking over each other like this. When someone's trying to make a point about something that's complex like this... This isn't to say Joe will never let himself get interrupted. In fact, he often allows friends to speak over him when they're just messing around. It's when he has something he feels is important to say that he makes sure he gets heard. If calling out an interruption feels a bit aggressive for you, there's a third tactic you can use if you want to keep command of a conversation and avoid creating resentment. And that is to pause, agree, and then continue with your original thought. For example, here's a clip of Joe talking to Alex Jones about whether or not Google should go into China. Because China copies everything. I mean, their intellectual copyright law over there... Yeah, but then they're just going to steal it better now. True, but this is what they're saying. Here's another example with Alex Jones. Notice how instead of simply plowing through, Joe pauses to say, making sure Alex feels heard. Wait a minute. We're saying so many things. Listen, I love you to death, but you say so many different things. I believe they are, but you say so many different things without stopping. So when you're interrupted while saying something you think is important, acknowledge the person and what they've said and then return back to what you were saying. This is a great way to command respect in a conversation and make the person you're talking to feel respected and heard. Now that said, Joe is not a people pleaser. He doesn't spend every second of the conversation trying to get people to like him. In fact, one of the strongest habits he has that immediately commands respect is that he will share his honest thoughts even if he knows some people might not like them. Joe explains his mindset to Jamie Kilstein after Jamie claims he can't speak freely for fear of cancel culture. And I couldn't say, that's f***ing crazy. I couldn't say... Why couldn't you say that? Because it would be fat shame. In the box that I had put myself in, I couldn't say that. I thought it. I said it off the air. But why wouldn't you... See, this is where it gets real problematic when it comes to expressing your ideologies. Like if you can't be honest about your actual thoughts, then what you're doing is b****. For your own self-esteem and integrity, you should be honest all the time. That said, there are three areas in particular where proactive honesty will instantly help you command more respect from the people around you. The first is your own motivations for doing things. Most people try to pretend to be more charitable or angelic than they actually are, which can come off as unlikable or try-hard. By contrast, watch Joe explain why he returned to Fear Factor. The reasoning to go back to it, it's for the F you money, right? Oh yeah, 100%. It's all for money. This gets a laugh because of how blunt he is about it, especially since many people would pretend that money isn't the major motivator for their work, even if it was. If you stand out from the crowd by sharing something about yourself that other people might not be comfortable sharing, you immediately get respect for your honesty, even if people don't like the motivation itself. The second area where honesty instantly commands respect is when you call someone else out for bad behavior. This is especially powerful in situations where the people around you are likely thinking the same thing, but wouldn't have the confidence to say it. For example, watch him call out Jamie here for abusing the word like. Google me. It's like sexual misconduct stuff, and like that's really scary. And again, I don't want to be like, you know who the real victim of Harvey Weinstein is? Jamie Kilstein. Let me just stop you right here. If you say like one more time, my head's going to explode. Dude, I get comments like that. It's brutal. This clearly went over well with the audience. It's one of the top comments. But you don't want to get respect from people around you at the expense of your relationship with the person you're talking to. Joe understands this, so watch how he softens the call out. I do it too, man. A lot of people do it. It's an easy one to do. I'm gonna hit. This I'm not perfect either is a great way to earn respect for your honesty and help maintain your relationship with the person you called out. The third area where Joe's honesty earns him respect is when he shares his opinions in the two no-go topics of polite society — politics and religion. These are topics many of us have been told to avoid, but Joe will buck that advice and share his honest opinions here too, even when he knows he might get backlash for it. For example, here he is in 2013 discussing transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox fighting in women's MMA. And she wants to be able to fight women in MMA. I say no f***ing way. This can be a scary prospect for most people. One thing you can do to make this much easier for yourself is to proactively address ways you might be misunderstood. If you go out of your way to build common ground and answer their objections before they even say them, you'll feel much more confident doing this and it will be better received. For instance, watch how Joe makes it clear his issue is with Fallon fighting women, not the fact that she's transgender. He builds a bridge for people to agree with him on Fallon Fox without being transphobic. You know, you want to be a woman and you want to take female hormones, you want to get a boob job, that's all fine. I support your life to live, your right to live as a woman. Joe later said this podcast caused some of the worst backlash he's ever faced online but he was also respected for it by many people who agreed with him. When you're confidently honest about who you are and what you believe, you become like a magnet. Some people may be repelled but you also attract people to you in a powerful way. The danger here is if you're receiving respect and praise from people you agree with, it can be easy to want to avoid anyone who disagrees with you and get caught in an echo chamber. Many people today are guilty of this. By contrast, Joe actively seeks to break the echo chamber. He often brings on guests who have opposing viewpoints and he's willing to change his mind on even his long-held beliefs. For example, he was once vocal that the moon landings were fake but after hearing opposing views, he changed his mind. Married to like ideas and opinions like that because they're not you but we think that they are, they're like an extension of us so we want to win these arguments. Yeah, we want to be right. I think it gets real scary when you want to be right and then you're willing to ignore evidence that might show that you're wrong. That's how I felt about myself. Another example is when MMA coach Firas Zahabi told Joe, who's been an athlete since childhood, that he's been working out wrong all his life. If you're sore, you overdid it. Because I can't train the next day if I'm sore. But I overdo it every time I work out then. What's that? I said I've overdone it every time I work out. You may have. There's a lot of people listening to this right now. Wait a minute, what? Many people would let their ego get the best of them here and try to defend the way they've been doing something their entire life. Instead, Joe just laughs. This willingness to really consider alternative opinions is one of the things that makes Joe so fascinating to listen to in conversation and it allows him to connect with a wide variety of people from all different backgrounds and all over the political spectrum. Now, one thing that helps Joe do all these things is that he seems to have a deep-rooted confidence in himself. If you feel like you don't have the confidence to pull off some of this advice, I recommend checking out our program, Charisma University. It's the fastest way I know to build your charisma and confidence and it's literally guaranteed to work in just 30 days. And it's structured with a daily action guide so there's no guesswork when it comes to learning these habits. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below but I figure the best way to let you know what this is all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written in via email or the course comments. The first one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career and he says, Now, this next one comes from another person who started a new job saying, The confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset, and with all your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it just could not go wrong. And he finishes by saying, And this last one is a comment in the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their social and dating life and he says, And there are more success stories like those in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all. And it's 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because we want to make sure that every single person truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course. Otherwise, you can just get a refund. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it and I hope that you decide to join if this is an area of your life that you're looking to improve.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Yay has been doing interviews recently and they have not all gone well. Hey, hey, bro, I ain't finished. I ain't finished my sentence. Nothing you're saying has anything to do with it. It's not uncommon for someone to get frustrated in a disagreement. What's rare is for you to argue with someone and have them walk away liking you more but that's exactly what happened in the conversation between Yay and Lex Friedman. So in today's video, we'll break down that conversation to show you eight tips to change someone's mind and have them love you for it. First, let's start with two common mistakes you have to avoid if you want to be persuasive. Here's a quick example of mistake number one. Now, tell me this. Have you seen the Candace Owens BLM documentary? I have watched some of that documentary but here's what I would say to you. When you watch that video of George Floyd— No, it's not a but. It's not— Well, I haven't watched the whole thing. Yay clearly wants to say something about that documentary. That question was a tee-up. When you transition away from a topic without first listening to what the other person wants to say, it can make them feel like you don't value their thoughts. The ultimate form of this is mistake number two, cutting someone off. This is what starts the conflict between Piers and Yay. I need you to watch— I know. I know what you said about— I know Candace. I'm going to finish. La, la, la— Sorry, you don't have to do that. I know what it means. La, la, la means be quiet and let me finish. You did interrupt my question. So almost every heated argument starts when you stop listening or empathizing with the other person. So if you want to disagree with someone without it turning into a fight, the first step is to listen deeply and make the other person feel heard. Lex does this in a very overt way. Do you think I would trust anybody at this point in my life? Yeah, it's tough. It's tough. It's tough. I hear you. I hear you. Three powerful words, especially when someone is sharing a negative feeling. For more complex ideas, a great way to make someone feel heard is with positive paraphrasing. Repeat back what they've said accurately in a way they'll agree with. When you've allowed people to be in your life that shouldn't be there and then they do the thing you knew they were going to do and you're screaming at them, but you really need to scream at yourself. Yeah. So you realize anything that's like anger or frustration, that's something that's wrong with you that needs to be dealt with. Yes. Making someone feel heard is an important part of any conversation. So now let's get into how to command respect specifically in a disagreement. Here's a quick example where Ye says something Lex disagrees with. A Jewish friend of mine said, come go visit the Holocaust Museum. And my response was, let's visit our Holocaust Museum, Planned Parenthood. The first step when you want to disagree is to use a calm, slow voice. With all due respect, I grew up in the Soviet Union. I'm Jewish. Parts of my family perished in the Holocaust of Nazi Germany. I have to push back. How your argument is received is not just about what you say, but how you say it, specifically your speed and volume. Listen to these next two clips. Who would you rather argue with? Ye or Lex? Or why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself? Ha, Sway! Take a few steps back to go. You ain't got the answers, man. You ain't got the answers. You ain't got the answers. You ain't got the answers, Sway. The most dangerous place for a black person in America is in their mother's stomach. 900 to a million abortions in the United States a year. I hear you. But there's something about the rape, the torture, the murder. This advice is most useful when something triggers you. If you feel yourself getting angry, let that be your cue to pause, take a breath, and use a calm, slow voice. For example, a few days before the conversation with Lex, Ye tweeted, When I wake up, I'm going DEATHCON 3 on Jewish people. Then, throughout the conversation, Ye has been talking about the evils of the media and he insists on calling it the Jewish media. This frustrates Lex, but listen to how he responds. Don't say Jewish media and Jewish controlled media. JM. Like, man, you sound like, it sounds too much like 1930s Nazi Germany. That last clip has another great habit. If you're going to criticize, criticize specific behavior. Listen here for another example. And when you say Jewish media, it's funny how this world works that way. When you say Jewish media, there's a large number of people that are hurting and have anger and even have hate in their heart. When they hear Jewish media, they start — that hate starts being directed towards the Jewish people. Lex doesn't call Ye racist or anti-Semitic. He criticizes the specific actions he didn't like. If you want to persuade someone, you have to avoid the far too common mistake of negatively labeling the entire person. Imagine how you would feel to be peers in these next clips. No, you're a liar. You're pressing the agenda. You're being a Karen. When you label the entire person as bad, they're likely to dig in and become hard to persuade. If someone already seems dug in, there is something you can do to help them become more receptive to new ideas. When you agree with them, tell them. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. It's well put. It's really well put. I agree. I agree. Most people make a common mistake. They keep their positive thoughts to themselves and say their negative thoughts out loud. Sharing when you agree helps build rapport. As you'll see in this next clip, it's also a great way to diffuse anger. For context, just so the clip makes sense, Ye previously said he doesn't like BLM and thinks the organization used George Floyd's death for their own benefit. You should find people in your life you can trust. Don't tell me what I should do. I'm not one of your BLM marchers. Listen, I'm with you on the BLM. A lot of organizations use tragedy and I watched the Candace Owens documentary. And what was your take on it? Now, sometimes you truly struggle to agree with anything the other person is saying. But no matter what your disagreement is, you can almost always express empathy. For example, Lex hates what Ye said about Jewish people, but he can still express empathy for how hard things must be for Ye right now because of that tweet. And notice how this improves Ye's mood. You're under a lot of attack. A lot of attack by a lot of people. You have a vision and you're trying to feel your way through it and you might get destroyed for it. That's the human, uh, that's the risk you take. It's a wonderful life though. Expressing empathy is a great way to strengthen your connection to someone even in an argument. It can also help that person extend empathy back to you. And seeing things from each other's perspective is often all it takes to transform a heated argument into a calm collaboration. This is especially powerful when you combine it with another habit — be vulnerable when you feel a negative emotion. Let's look at an example where Ye says something potentially upsetting to Lex. Because I hope I'm somebody you can trust. I don't fucking trust you. In Lex's position, most people would get angry or defensive. Instead, Lex and Ye talk for a few more minutes and then Lex says this. But I gotta tell you, I have to be honest, um, I don't — this is silly because you don't know me but it hurt when you say you don't trust me. You kind of lost me. Honest vulnerability is rare and very likely to make the other person respect you more. It also helps build trust because you're sharing something that most people would try to hide. In this particular conversation, it actually helps Ye see himself trusting Lex one day. It's like, I could be turning my thing from a potential world vision to a code or I could be opening up conversations with new friends that I may trust someday. If you do everything we've covered so far, it's likely you'll form strong connections even during disagreements. And with that connection, you'll often see the other person try to use humor to take little breaks in the argument. A little way to say, hey, we may be arguing but I don't hate you for it. When you feel it's appropriate, try to accept these playful breaks. For example, this next clip is a bit of an awkward forward glance. It's a bit of an awkward forced joke, but you can see Ye loves that Lex played along. People, just in general, they love me so much. I'm like actually a hard guy to really hate for a long period of time just because like, because of like my huge cock. And that's what I noticed. I didn't understand why you showed it to me when we first met. But now I understand. Yeah. It's very nice. Congratulations. Ye also tried to joke with Piers, but Piers steamrolled it. So they went right back to arguing. I said answer my question. No, I'm interviewing you too. Well, you can't interview me. It's my interview. You're Bono. I'm interviewing you too. See, that's the way we rap. Let me just, no, no, let me just put this to you. So no, no, no, no, you're trying to avoid something. The last habit we'll cover today is arguably the strongest thing in this entire video. If you want to influence someone, give them a reputation they like and will want to live up to. Both Piers and Lex want to guide Ye to the same conclusion. You shouldn't vilify an entire group because of the actions of a few people. Ye argues with them both that he shouldn't have to apologize for hurting Jewish people because he himself is hurt and no one has apologized to him. Have you felt my pain yet? You haven't felt my pain. I don't have to feel your pain because I also have pain too that's not being recognized. Now watch how Piers responds to Ye's pain. It does not make Ye apologetic. That doesn't change the fact that when you insult the Jewish people and say, you're going DEFCON 3 on the Jewish people, that is as racist as anything you say you've been through and any pain that you've experienced. It's the same thing. Racism is racism and you know that, I think, don't you? Yeah, obviously, that's why I said it. Piers is right but when you're in an argument, just being logically correct won't often change how someone feels. That's a common misconception people have. Being correct is not the same as being persuasive. Now listen to how Lex responds to Ye's pain. A great man still through the pain does the right thing. Lex knows that Ye wants to be a great man so he gives him this reputation to live up to. Here's a different example from later in the conversation. Instead of simply saying, you shouldn't be hateful, Lex again describes Ye in a way Ye likely wants to live up to. This is what finally persuades Ye to give a heartfelt apology. So before God, what I would do is start off as a samurai and say, I'm sorry for hurting you as a Jewish person. I'm sorry for the way that made you feel and I'm sorry for the entire population of a race that I feel is actually my brothers. At the end, they reach an agreement that we can hopefully all agree with. We want to live in a world filled with love, not hate. As Lex said, if we're to engineer a better future, the way to do it is with love. So to that end, Charlie and I have donated $250,000 from Charisma on Command to Charity Water because we want to live in a world where we all love and take care of each other. Through Charity Water, every $40 donated gets someone access to clean water for 10 years.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, you'll learn six habits that instantly make you more attractive. We'll do this by breaking down some clips of Jack Harlow because he has an easy, authentic style of flirting that many women find extremely attractive. You made me nervous. You've been making me nervous this whole interview. Oh, Jack, don't tempt me. I'm a married woman but I'll leave him. Oh, don't say that. Let's start at the beginning with how to start a conversation. A big part of attraction is confidence and you can show that confidence in the first 10 seconds of an interaction if you approach without hesitation. Sweetie, how it feel doing numbers? Hey, girl, what's up? Hi, sweetie. Hi. Jack. I know. Good to see you. Most guys know they should approach without hesitating but they get too nervous or their mind goes blank and they can't think of anything to say. So you end up circling the venue a few times without talking to anyone or glancing over a bunch of times before you approach, which sabotages your first impression. One thing that helps here is if you have an opening sentence you know you like. This isn't a constraint against being spontaneous, it's a backup plan in case your mind goes blank. Here are Jack's two favorite opening lines. What's your best chat up line? Oh. Hi. Was that it? Undefeated. Hi. You know what else is undefeated? Hi, I'm Jack. Of course, Jack has some big advantages over most people. He's a rich, famous celebrity. Sweetie even says she already knows who he is. But there is a riff on this line that anyone can use to start a conversation, especially at an event where it's possible you know a lot of people, like a house party or local bar. It's, hey, I don't think I've met you yet. I'm Jack. Except, say your name. Adding the phrase, I don't think I've met you yet, helps your approach feel more natural. It explains why you're introducing yourself so it feels less randomly creepy. And it implies that you're social and you know a lot of people at the venue, at least enough that they stand out to you as someone you haven't met yet. This is a super easy way to get into conversation, but it won't magically make someone fall in love with you. In fact, even Sweetie doesn't initially show much interest, instead playfully making fun of Jack. Watch how he handles it. Why are you shaking? Am I? Yeah. Oh, nobody's shaking. Nobody's shaking. So that brings us to habit number two. If someone teases you, assume they're being playful and take it positively. Some people will hear this advice and think it will make them look weak, but it's actually having a defensive response that makes you look reactive and less attractive. What's something that you really hate about a guy? When I'm trying to go to the bathroom on 6th Street and they're like, hey, can I ask you a question? Ha ha ha ha. You? We got the same thing. We gotta go. Well, you have to stop. He would have looked more confident if he had been able to laugh along with her joke. Now, if they said something truly offensive to you, then obviously you don't have to stay playful. But at that point, don't worry about being attractive to someone who's genuinely rude to you. Better to find someone else to talk to. Okay, so let's get a bit more specific. What does taking a tease positively actually look like? Here's an easy framework you can steal from Jack. Step one, fake defensiveness. You say something defensive, but with a big smile. This shows that you're actually unfazed. For example, watch how Jack reacts when someone says something that could have been offensive to a lot of rappers at his level. Here we are, you're nominated tonight. But what I realized is, and I thought, I thought you had, I thought you had already won a Grammy before. You haven't. So what would it mean for you to, what would it mean for you, though, to win a Grammy tonight? Because tonight could be a huge night for you. I mean, it's an honor to be nominated. Yeah, it'd mean a lot. You know, maybe when I do this interview next year, you won't be able to say that. So I'll feel good. Step two, you can playfully tease them back. I like drama. Okay. Okay, you like drama. Yeah, I'm messy. I think I'm messy too. No, I'm not messy. But thank you for admitting you are. Okay, we don't, we're about to be done because you don't call me out twice on this interview. You called me out. First thing that happened when I walked over here, you said, you know, you don't have any Grammys. How does it feel? I did it in a positive way. This ties right into habit number three, push-pull. Use a mix of teases and compliments. Push-pull makes conversation with you more fun because you're not predictable. Your teasing helps people get laughing and builds attraction, and your compliments make people feel good around you and show that your teasing doesn't mean you dislike them. For example, watch how Jack breaks the tension in that last conversation. You've been nominated three times. Yeah. But you haven't won. It could be a huge night for you. Six times. Three times tonight. Come on. Three times tonight. You're good. You're great. Um, thank you. One thing some men struggle with is complimenting a woman in a way that's not creepy. It's much easier to give a compliment and not come off creepy if you give a compliment that you would give regardless of if you're attracted to the person or not. Hello, Jack Harlow. How you doing? Y'all know how to make a man smile. That's for sure. Wow. You just brought a smile to my face, brother. You just warmed my soul up. If you give someone a compliment, especially a physical compliment, you want to say it like you aren't trying to get anything back for it. The vibe Jack gives off is that he's simply saying what he thinks is true without expecting anything in return for the compliment. Is someone here, though, that you got your eye on? Let me see. I'm right here, Jack. Just kidding. Don't get me wrong. You're beautiful. I just, you know, I thought you meant somebody on this sheet y'all got right here. Again, this is helped by his experience saying compliments about people he doesn't have sexual interest in. I can't even name who it was on. Dejounte Murray was on that. Oh, my God. Yeah, it was a good play. Take that back. Oh, nice. Love me some Dejounte Murray. He's smooth as hell. He's like a jaguar. Love his body. Love how he moves, man. What's the second time you've said that you've loved somebody's body? What? You saying I'm showing too much love to people? In your own life, if you want to practice this skill, make it easy for yourself and start with non-physical compliments. And don't force yourself to give compliments you don't mean just to practice. The practice is when you do think of something positive about someone, share it with them. That ties closely to another thing that makes Jack attractive. Honesty in situations where a lot of guys would lie. So what's your type? My type? Dark hair. You might think he's purposefully saying her opposite, but he's said this in multiple interviews. It's just his truth. Also, did you notice that when he says it, he smiles? There's a playful self-amusement in saying something he knows isn't the answer most guys would give. That self-amusement is also attractive. Here's one more example. What, like, is the most romantic thing you've done for someone? Bought them a plane ticket. Was it a private jet? No. Economy. 58C. Beautiful women are used to guys who will say anything to try to get a date. So, ironically, you stand out when you don't seem like you're trying hard to impress them. In general, Jack gives off a cool-com vibe because he isn't desperate for a romantic connection. You saw that in that earlier clip where the woman says, I'm right here, Jack, and it's consistent in his interviews. Notice, he doesn't say they aren't beautiful. He's not putting them down. He's just not instantly all-in. If you show interest in dating someone just because they're attractive, it makes you less attractive. To be attractive, have standards beyond beauty. You'll be more interesting, and you'll avoid relationships with people who aren't right for you. One thing that can help you have better dating standards is having other things in your life that you care about. In Jack's case, he's open to dating, but his top priority is music. It's his career and his passion, and he cares more about it than meeting women or partying. This isn't to say that in order to be attractive, you have to only care about work. That's not a recipe for happiness. You want a balanced life with friends or family you care about, and a career or hobbies you're passionate about. A life you're happy with, even if you aren't dating. When you have other things you care about in your life, you won't be desperate to date just anyone, which, ironically, will make more people want to date you. The second thing that helps you create standards beyond beauty is having options. When you feel like someone is the only person that could possibly make you happy, or worse, perhaps the only person that could possibly like you, it's almost impossible for you to be attractive. If you feel you need them, you can't help but act needy. There are a lot of ways to build a life with more dating options. You can work on your appearance, talents, social circle, social status, or career, just to name a few. But the fastest way I know of to build a life with options is to develop your charisma. Becoming world-class in most things takes years, sometimes decades. But with charisma, you can massively improve in just a month or two. Most people simply never try to learn it, or if they do try, they don't know how to do it effectively. If you want the fastest way I know of to develop your charisma so you can quickly start living a life with more options, you may like our Charisma University. It's a step-by-step video program that tells you exactly what to do every day, so that 30 days from now, you radiate confidence and charisma. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. Life-changing. I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event that I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Loving the course. I've liked a girl for over a year now, but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we're dating. Thank you so much for this program. After going through charisma, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values, and I know who I am. We guarantee Charisma University will change your life. That means you can take the entire course, and if you don't think it's worth the investment, you can give yourself a full refund just by pushing a button.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Jordan Peterson has some of the best debate moments on the internet. Why should your right to freedom of speech trump a trans person's right not to be offended? I mean, look at the conversation we're having right now. You know, like, you're certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth. Why should you have the right to do that? It's been rather uncomfortable. But his surrounded video is not at that level. And I know plenty of people are going to discuss the content of what he debated. The semantic fog. I just feel like you kind of retreat into this semantic fog. I'm not retreating at all. I'm advancing, sir. You are retreating. And how do you define that that filled the conversation? How do you define the God that you're rejecting? How do you define worship? You define God. Define God. Define it. Define it. We define. Define that. Define something. Define worship. What I want to focus on is the most important part of the debate if you care about changing the mind of the person across from you. Not semantics or gotchas. Ha, gotcha. Or even sound logic but the connection that you form through your rapport and charisma because even a sound argument will not move people if you get these pieces wrong. So here's the first key point. You want to choose amusement over frustration when someone misrepresents or misunderstands you. To see this in action, let's rewind to Jordan's encounter with Cathy Newman. Notice his reaction to her twisting his words. So you don't believe in equal pay? No, I'm not saying that at all. When she continues doing it, he even goes as far as to comment that he finds it all silly. I really think that's silly. I do. I think that's silly. He finds it funny when she can't represent him accurately and this allows him to stay calm and centered enough to effectively point out her inconsistencies later on. But in the surrounded video, Jordan did not find misunderstandings amusing. Within just five minutes of starting, one person said, the instead of uh, and Jordan replied like this. God rewards Moses with a glimpse of the divine. So this is a definition of the God that atheists are hypothetically rejecting. A possible one. I said ah, I didn't say the. That frustration was also present in other conversations when he felt he wasn't accurately represented. It's an absurdity to say that the Christian God doesn't fit within Christian ethics, that like the Christian God isn't like Christian ethical. I said that the specific statements that you made don't take the context of the stories into account and so that your analytical approach is faulty. Sure. Don't put words in my mouth. Sure, then let's go to the exam. So ask yourself, whose perspective are you more likely to open up to? The one who laughs and finds you amusing or the one who scolds you? So instead of allowing yourself to get heated, remind yourself that you can choose amusement. If you drop the quest to be perfectly understood, you can actually play with the misunderstandings and that will make you more persuasive. Check out how a little joke about a misunderstanding will set the stage for a good faith conversation. And I would say that we find genocide in Scripture. I would argue though... So you agree with my claim? Yeah, I think it's in Scripture. Yeah, I mean, I think it's in there. Okay, well, thanks for watching, everyone. Yeah, this is good. Yeah, good stuff. And of course, if the misunderstandings happen non-stop, you can draw a boundary. I covered this in the original Peterson video and a bunch of others but for now, let's hop into the second point which is that most people respond best to a receptive style of listening rather than an interrogative one. So let's pause here to describe these two types because each does have their place. A receptive style of listening is based around feeling someone's overall vibe. You're not getting hung up on a particular detail. You're trying to feel the big picture. And the body language that naturally flows from this will look like sitting neutrally in your seat or leaning back, smiling while you're listening, or speaking through a smile when you're responding, opening your eyes wider, and letting your peripheral vision come online. And you'll also see extended periods of listening without fact-checking every minor detail. Now, the interrogative style of listening is based around listening for inconsistencies. Every detail of what someone says is run through a filter to catch the exact moment that they deviate from truth or logical consistency. And this tends to look like leaning forward in your seat, grimacing, or straining to pick up every word they say, narrowing your eyes so you can laser in on the speaker, and you'll tend to have shorter periods of listening as inconsistencies are immediately fact-checked. We just don't agree on the justification that God is the only thing that provides morality. It's not a justification. It's a definition. Now, there's a time for this style. When you suspect someone is lying and you don't want to allow them to sweep things under the rug, laser in. Details matter. But in any argument that isn't about scoring internet points, the receptive style is more effective. And even in internet debates, the receptive style can be incredibly effective. Alex O'Connor modeled this beautifully in his Surrounded episode. He spent most of the time listening receptively when he wasn't speaking, but on the rare occasion that he drifted into that interrogative style, he immediately caught himself and apologized. God, actually, his purpose is to make us become as he is. Yes. Does that include animals as well? Animals are part of the created order that will be redeemed along with the rest of the created order. Okay, so what does suffering do for them? Suffering is part of the inherent nature of the world as a fallen world, okay? Even for animals? Yes, even for animals. Whose fault is that? Let me break it down. Sorry, I'm throwing a lot of questions. You notice when he switches modes, the body language takes care of itself. He leans back, his gaze and face soften, and he stops interrupting. But if it's not already clear, Jordan spent a solid amount of time in that interrogative mode. He did have sections of more receptive listening, but overall, it was something that hurt him from a rapport-building perspective and I think it led to some of the more friendly conversations turning needlessly contentious. For instance, this guy, Greg, enters with a playful attitude and respectful demeanor. Aha! Hi, nice to meet you. How are you doing? Good, how are you? What's your name? I'm Greg, nice to meet you. But during the conversation, Jordan got hung up on interrogation style details. It goes back to where I'm saying initially- I'm not defining it, Elijah defines it. Okay, so as Elijah defines God- It's defined that way in Jonah too. Okay, so as- Cardinal Newman also defined it that way. I'm sure you know many people who defined it that way and it's impressive. You're a very knowledgeable person. I'm not trying to be impressive. I'm just pointing out to you how God is defined in the Old Testament. All right. And the interaction wound up turning by the end. I made a specific point that God was associated with conscience. I just feel like you kind of retreat into this semantic fog. I'm not retreating at all. I'm advancing, sir. You are retreating. Well, it was very nice to meet you. I appreciate the conversation. So only do interrogative style when the details really matter like in catching a liar. Otherwise, it'll feel like you're being overly aggressive or like you're trying to deflect from the incompleteness of your own argument. And that brings us to the next point which I'm calling the anti-NBA rule. Instead of dunking on people when you've got them cornered, extend a helping hand. Now, dunking in this context is when you take a moment of confusion in the other person whether it's substantial to their argument or it's just semantics and you use it to declare victory. You say that you respect the Second Amendment and, you know, I brought this here for you so that you can read it. It's the Constitution. Energetically, it's you reveling in the other person being wrong. Now, Jordan had a few light dunks in the Jubilee interview. Can we stay on what we were talking about? We are. Okay. You're just uncomfortable with the question. Require some level of morality or... Into what? I'm not disagreeing. Sure. Why do they require that? Because it's the only way that social groups can actually survive, right? That's my point with regards to science. Thank you very much. And he has his most famous light dunk at the end of the Kathy Newman interview. I'm just trying to work that out. I mean... Ha, gotcha. You have got me. You have got me. I'm trying to... Generally, Jordan is good about not dunking, and that was mostly true in his Surrounded episode. Some of the other participants, though, did not do a great job of avoiding dunks. You're a Christian. You say that. I haven't claimed that. Oh, what is this? Is this Christians versus atheists? I don't know. You don't know where you are right now. Don't be a smartass. I think everyone should look at the title of the YouTube channel. You're probably in the wrong YouTube video. You're really quite something, aren't I? But you're really quite nothing, right? You're not a Christian. I'm done with him. Even though this behavior makes for viral shorts content, my advice is not to lean into dunking. It gets you a temporary high but it comes at the cost of the relationship. What you want to do instead in these situations is extend a hand and this is essential if you care at all about people growing from the debate because it's in these moments of kindness where somebody's point has been defeated that you let them integrate new information rather than defend their ego from someone who's attacking them. Jordan handled this exceedingly well in the Kathy Newman interview. Listen for how many extensions of kindness are included in his communication after he stumped her. Why should you have the right to do that? It's been rather uncomfortable. Well, I'm very glad I put you on the spot. You get my point. It's like you're doing what you should do which is digging a bit to see what the hell's going on and that is what you should do but you're exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me and that's fine. And even the light dunk of the gotcha was quickly followed up with a playful joke that implied Kathy was a tough debater and then he even laughs. I'm just trying to work that out. I mean, ha, gotcha. You have got me. You have got me. I'm trying to work that through my head. Yeah, yeah, it took a while. It took a while. It did, yeah. It took a while. Another great thing to do in moments where you have debunked someone's claim is to shift to inclusive language meaning you talk about who you also once thought the same thing as them. This helps them feel like they're not wrong. You can also speak in we sentences. You can watch Alex O'Connor do it after he counters a theist's point in his Surrounded episode and he puts himself on her side in the quest for truth. Same thing for a woman giving birth, right? It's suffering like it sucks, it hurts. Sure, but imagine you could have the giving birth without the pain of giving birth. Would you prefer that? Of course, yeah, you would prefer that. So then if God can bring about the good stuff without the bad stuff, then there's no reason to bring about the bad stuff. So what we have to show is why the bad stuff is necessary to bring about the good stuff. Otherwise, it's not just right. Everything that we've talked about in this video will become much easier with one simple realization. You have very little to lose in a debate or an argument. You're not bound to serve anyone who gets you semantically trapped or logically cornered. You don't become anything different if someone defines you as a Christian or an atheist or a good person or a bad person. Yes, you are exploring and attacking ideas but you are safe. An opinion, even if it's presented as objective truth and everyone who disagrees with it is wrong, is just an opinion. You don't need to fight with these. So while there is nothing to lose, there are things that you can gain in an argument. There's the enjoyment of a fun spa. There's the opportunity to expand your understanding of the world and most importantly, there's deeper connection with another person. And if that's something that you really want to master outside of just debates and arguments, you may be interested in our course, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step 30-day program that tells you exactly what to do every day so that by the end of it, you are radiating confidence and charisma without even thinking about it. Here's just a few things that our past members have said. I had confidence in some areas but not in others. Then, Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. Another member wrote, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one in conversations. I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think. I feel much happier all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman I've had a crush on for about a year and made a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep going back to it when I need a refresher on the daily action modules. This program is literally guaranteed to change your life which means that you can take the entire course and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund right from inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Why does anyone spend money on OnlyFans in a world where X-rated content is free? I asked myself that question the other day and quickly concluded that people were just being stupid, and I moved on. But of course, that's not the case. I've learned that whenever I think masses of people are being stupid, I'm the one who's being stupid. I just don't understand them, but if I did, I'd learn something about the real world and human psychology. So with credit card in hand, I signed up for an OnlyFans investigation, and what I found surprised me, not only for what it said about human psychology, but also the direction that consumerism is taking all of us. But before we get there, we need to cover exactly what OnlyFans is. Essentially, OnlyFans allows anyone to put a paywall on their content. You can set up a monthly subscription fee and have the option for one-off upsells to easily monetize photos, video, audio, or just the chance to message you directly. OnlyFans has some fitness trainers and some musicians on the platform, but really, they specialize in X-rated content. Same story with their co-owned sister site, MyFreeCams, which offers live X-rated webcam chat rooms. On both platforms, the dominant business model is men paying women for racy messages, photos, and video, which is where the question that started this whole video arose — why do these men pay when free pornography has been available on the web since 56k dial-up connections? The surprising answer comes in three parts. First, OnlyFans has nailed the dopamine hooks of social media sites and casinos that pornography has not fully exploited on the web. You see, the very structure of OnlyFans is gated silos. When you log into a creator's page, you can see the number of posts they have but no details about those posts. Once you're a subscriber, you can see the posts but some of them are blurred out behind a locked paywall. The only thing that you can see is a provocative text description. Of course, though, you can pay to unlock those. If you want to go deeper into the gated community, you can order custom videos, but you'll have to send extra tip money to get those made for you. The constant feeling that one has on OnlyFans is kind of like the one that you might get if your phone buzzed with a text or someone sent you a Snap video, but you couldn't open it. There's mystery, you're thinking about it, and that creates anticipation. You can contrast this with X-rated websites where every mystery is immediately revealed. Want to know what's in a video? In seconds, you can read the explicit title, see an explicit thumbnail, and even hover over that thumbnail to see various moments in the scene. There's almost zero space in between desire and the fulfillment of that desire. With OnlyFans, though, your imagination has to work. You focus on the hints at each level of gated content, wondering what exactly is on the other side. And when you focus longer on something, you tend to value it more. That's partially why digital slot machines still show the real stopping one by one. That extra time builds anticipation and investment in the game. Now, the dopamine hacks are even more aggressive on the live cam sister sites that incorporate other staples of the gambling industry straight from it. There are kino boards in the chat where buying the winning number can get you a sexy dance or something of that nature instead of gambling winnings. There's roulette wheels with different racy activities for your preferred cam girl to act out. And if you donate enough tips on censored OnlyFan posts, that will make the creator show the uncensored version. The unclear amount required, though, to win is reminiscent of those coin games in Chuck E. Cheese where the next coin could be the one that tipped the whole game. Again, the prize in all of these cases is similar to what's available on every other pornography website. But the mystery in anticipation drives seemingly irrational behavior. Family Guy understood this years ago. Not so fast, Lois. A boat's a boat but the mystery box could be anything. It could even be a boat! But the mystery box isn't the only thing that has made OnlyFans so successful. Our second point is where OnlyFans starts to really distinguish itself. Take the top creator, Jem Wolfie. Her Instagram page is pretty darn explicit in several photos but what's missing here? You. On Instagram, Jem is often aloof. She doesn't always look at the camera. The audience is more like a voyeur that she doesn't recognize. But on OnlyFans, the audience is acknowledged. She and other creators will often send messages asking you to react if you like the recent shots. And at the time of writing this, in her last ten Instagram posts, Jem has commented the word you or you're only twice. But with OnlyFans, those words appear in eight of the last ten posts. This recognition becomes something like intimacy when creators send good morning or good night texts claiming to be thinking of you. One creator sent me a message complaining about being bored asking me slash all of us to write messages to give her something to do and I'll tell you how I responded in the next point. But the point for now is that the relationship on OnlyFans begins to mimic a friendship or a long-distance relationship at least in its cadence. In fact, active members of live cam chat rooms often form friend groups. They recognize one another when they came in which was shocking to me. They'll check in with one another to see how the big work project went or where they've been if they haven't showed up in a while. If the creator doesn't stream though, the fans can't hang with that friend group on that day. So aspects of intimate relationships and friendships are offered via OnlyFans. But really, it's this last piece that makes OnlyFans potentially more addictive even than casinos because on OnlyFans, you can purchase guaranteed acceptance. I told you earlier that I responded to that creator who said that she was bored and I had a hunch that acceptance was a huge piece of the OnlyFans psychology puzzle. So I purposely wrote back the most lame boring message I could think of just to see if I could get her to reject or ignore me. This is a message that if you sent on a dating app like Tinder or Bumble would get you left on read because it's just totally uninteresting. It's the type of thing that so many guys text and it's very boring for someone who gets a lot of messages like this to respond to. I said, hey there, just doing some work this week, enjoying the sunshine, WBU, any plans? And what do you know, on OnlyFans, I didn't get left on read. She wrote back with a message containing two exclamation points and a smiley face emoji. That's without even tipping her which I suspect could have netted me half a dozen exclamation points. The point is on OnlyFans, I didn't need to make myself interesting to her. I didn't need to stand out from the crowd. She would remain interested even if I wasn't interesting. I saw the same dynamic in the hobbies of OnlyFans creators. On most dating apps, it's the exception to find a woman who emphasizes her love of basketball, golf, anime, or obscure philosophers. Of course, those women exist but those interests tend to be mainly held by men. On OnlyFans, the number of women highlighting predominantly male hobbies is through the roof. Beyond hobbies, I also saw stories of not fitting in in high school and feeling different from everyone else. Now, all of these creators may genuinely have these hobbies and backstories but their representation is far higher than that of the typical dating pool and I think the reason for this discrepancy is that men sometimes struggle to relate when speaking to a woman they're attracted to. They have to put an effort to make their hobbies relatable to someone who doesn't necessarily share them or step beyond their interests to talk to someone who doesn't love all the same activities, entertainment, and conversational topics. But OnlyFans shortcuts this discomfort. Not only will your dream girl send you naked photos, she'll also do the more important work of carrying the conversation, of finding ways to make relating easy. You don't need to feel uncomfortable or at a loss for words or reject it if she doesn't reply. For a fee, that's all gone. To reveal your biggest insecurity to someone that you're wildly attracted to and for them to see that insecurity, tell you the truth about it, and then not have that insecurity impact your relationship — that is not always the case outside of OnlyFans. We often have insecurities precisely because at some point, we were rejected for some aspect of our body, personality, or our history. It's one of the most gut-wrenching feelings and one most people avoid at all costs. So why does OnlyFans exist in a world with lots of pornography? Because if porn offers arousal and orgasm, OnlyFans offers connection without the fear of frustration or rejection. The difficulty of getting into and maintaining a relationship can be bypassed at least in part. For a price, you get a sex-obsessed long-distance girlfriend without having to offer her anything in return but money. You don't have to interest her, relate to her, or help her through any of her difficulties unless, of course, that's your thing. In a way, OnlyFans is a direct competitor to personal development resources including this channel because you no longer have to change your habits to get different results in your social or romantic life. Now, I should pause and say that OnlyFans doesn't totally replace relationships for all of its subscribers. Several creators told me that they have followers with girlfriends or wives. For those men, they said they offered an escape but I think that it's a similar escape to the men who are not in a relationship but are also subscribed. In both cases, you leave behind the obligations and pressures of dealing with another potentially difficult human being. My personal take is that this isn't great for the customer. If you bypass the challenges of relating to other people, you deprive yourself of life's major catalyst for personal growth. Instead of building hard-won character traits that can last a lifetime, you rely on cash to maintain relationships that are comfortable and pleasing to you. So my humble recommendation is to avoid paying for connection. Risk rejection to develop the skills and the character traits that make you someone people want to be around and someone that can handle the problems that arise when other people aren't being paid to be friendly. It's certainly slower and more difficult but I believe that it's ultimately more rewarding. And you can save your money for somewhere that it can go a lot farther. I'm talking about simping for charity. You see, we've partnered with Charity Water to get clean water to 10,000 people who don't have it. We are nearly halfway there but quite frankly, I need the help of this community to make it happen. If you choose to donate using the link below, even a small amount, the people that you are helping are people who may get diseases from dirty water who have to walk hours a day just to get a few gallons and try to avoid that fate for one more day. And what's crazy is that for the price of unlocking some OnlyFans photos, you personally can give someone clean water for 10 years. That is $30 to get someone clean water for a decade. We've worked with Charity Water in the past and thanks to your generous donations, we've already built several wells where entire communities get water every single day. And just so you know, every single dollar that you donate through the link below goes directly to the field so it's being used as efficiently as possible. So I hope that you click the link and, again, join me in simping for charity. It might be something that you decide on a whim right now but it is no exaggeration to say that that choice can literally save someone's life. And if you're on the edge, I will match whatever you donate until we hit those 10,000 people so your giving goes twice as far today. So click the link on the screen to donate. I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 665}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"I spent 10 years working on my confidence and making videos to share everything that I've learned. But recently, one man has helped me take my confidence to the next level. ♪♪ That's right, Aragorn. It might sound silly, but Aragorn is the embodiment of a psychological concept that I have become obsessed with, which is the archetype of the king. It's this idea that we all have access to a deep well of unconscious power, authority, and confidence. And by being reminded of that through myths, and stories, and symbols, we can begin to unlock that hidden power. So in this video, I want to dive into the characteristics of the archetypal king and discuss how you can apply that mature king energy to your own life to maximize your natural self-confidence. First, mature king energy has little interest in changing other people's minds, especially not with words. That's because the king does not form his perspective from consensus. So when a king is insulted or doubted by others, he pays them almost no attention. You cannot think that this ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king. The difference you immediately notice between this example and those from people insecure in king energy is in the level of reactivity, where confidence tends to be non-reactive both in body language and response. Insecurity leaps and screams and tries to change minds. The bigger the reaction, I am the king! the more intense the insecurity. Any man who must say I am the king is no true king. To be clear, the difference isn't that a secure king learns to stay quiet and still when he's insulted even though he's fuming on the inside. The deeper difference is that a king's understanding of himself is internally felt and it's not movable by the opinions of others. He genuinely doesn't feel the need to have a clever comeback because he doesn't need to put anyone in their place. Just know, fewer words, less performative action, and more steady building towards your goals will align you with the deep confidence of the king archetype. And that brings us to our second point. King energy inspires people around the king to feel a huge boost of confidence in themselves. They feel that more is possible and it literally is because the king energy is creative and that creativity rubs off on everyone around you. This is in contrast to insecure men who attain positions of power. Without access to the unshakable self-confidence of the king archetype, these men are primarily concerned with maintaining their position, saving face, and avoiding responsibility for failure. In short, these men are stuck in survival concern. If you won't defend your own city, why should they? What would you have me do? Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them. What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me? She did not say your grace. Now, on the other hand, mature king energy has moved out of mere survival into expansive creativity. That grants him the wisdom to see the difficulties that lie ahead without minimizing them. Then, his innate creativity can find a way in the most dire of situations. This is grounded optimism and it is incredibly inspiring. They say that it is hopeless. There is always hope. On occasion, this is communicated through rousing speeches but often, it's by coming up with useful strategies when others have lost their nerve. The fortress is taken. It is over. There's no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves. There is one passage. It leads into the mountains but they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many. Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass and barricade the entrance. So much death. What can men do against such reckless hate? Ride out with me. So if you want to tap into the creativity to find amazing solutions in high-pressure situations, the key is to bring your heart into communication with your head. Your heart paints a vision of the world that you want to live in. If it's a vision you're emotionally connected to, your head will provide a million creative ways to get there. You'll feel a huge boost of creative energy and a rub-off on everyone around you and you won't be afraid to be on the metaphorical front lines if the mission requires it. But if you don't let your heart paint the picture and instead live from a vision based on survival and ego protection, your head will go to work helping you survive not thrive. From there, it's going to mostly provide you with ways to save face and look good like delegating to others and then blaming them for failure. So although it can sound soft, you need to get in touch with your heart and in order to do that, the third aspect of king energy can be very helpful. That is that kings do not define themselves by what they hate or what they stand against but by what they love and what they stand for. This is harder than it sounds because you will inevitably find yourself in conflict in your life and in conflict, the temptation is to fall into oppositional defiance, to fight against the person or cause that is upsetting you while losing track of what you sought to gain in the first place. If you fall prey to this temptation, you can wind up victorious but having lost the world you wanted to create to begin with. Unfortunately, oppositional defiance is the hallmark of modern culture and politics. Ask yourself, does the committed Republican or Democrat love their party or do they mostly hate the other? So notice if you've slipped into oppositional defiance. For example, in your professional life, you may have felt the desire to become an entrepreneur to escape the rat race or in your romantic relationship, maybe you resist being taken advantage of or controlled. Nothing is wrong with either of those situations but if you succeed in those narrow aims, you may find yourself with a business or a relationship that isn't the one you most deeply desire. It'll just be one that you hate a little bit less. So channel that king energy and like Aragorn, even when you're fighting against something, remind yourself what you love and what you stand for. By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, men of the West! One specific question can reorient you if you've lost that connection and it's this, if I believe that miracles were possible, what outcome would absolutely thrill me? This will give you the inspiration and the motivation to come up with outside-the-box solutions and the courage to jump into the front lines if necessary but the king's willingness to be on the front lines needs to be balanced with the fourth point so that he's in abdicating his largest responsibilities in order to become a foot soldier and that is that the king has the restraint and the wisdom to support others without taking on the burdens that rightly belong to them. You see this when Aragorn refuses the temptation to carry the glory of the ring for himself knowing that is Frodo's task. I would have gone with you to the end, into the very fires of Mordor. The ability to know which burdens are yours and which aren't requires you to overcome the more common boy hero syndrome. The boy hero believes that he's the one who constantly needs to rescue people from their problems. Now this can be a beautiful and a valuable instinct when it's consciously chosen but many boy heroes are compulsive heroes. They're actually people pleasers, too afraid to let others struggle through their own issues because of how helpless it can make that boy hero feel. Those boy heroes can also be driven by a need to prove themselves worthy through helping which is what we see drive Boromir as his father insists that he bring the ring back to him. You must go. Bring me back this mighty gift. Unfortunately, this constant heroism gets in the way. The would-be hero takes on the burdens that aren't meant for him, preventing the growth of those around him and limiting his own effectiveness in dealing with his dragons. So when someone comes to you with an issue that they're having or you notice that someone is performing their best or you believe that they're deceiving themselves, before you leap in with help or advice, pause. Feel into your heart and ask, is this issue mine or not mine? The same question can be applied even if someone raises an issue and they say it's definitely to do with you. This happens a lot in romantic relationships as people often try to offload their anxiety of their abandonment issues onto their partner and by lovingly but firmly refusing to rescue people from their problems, you demonstrate a deeply held belief that they have everything they need to rescue themselves. This is the purest form of believing in someone. You will also create the space to deal with your own issues like the people-pleasing anxiety that can arise when people are upset with you for not saving them in the way that they may want. But I want to make clear, you can still support other people with problems that aren't yours. In fact, kings are often the best support you can ask for because their ego isn't involved. If by my life or death, I can protect you, I will. You have my sword. To offer the support, a great question to ask someone is, what kind of support would you like right now? Oftentimes, people realize that they're just looking for a place to talk things out so they can access their own inner wisdom. Now, those four pieces highlight what the king does but there's an underlying foundation that makes all of those behaviors flow naturally and it's the main thing you need to focus on most to unlock your own king energy. This is that you must be committed to clear seeing. This means you see other people for who they truly are, you see the world for what it is, and you know yourself deeply. This, like most of what I've covered, sounds simple but many people cannot do it. Forgive me. I did not see. So if you want to be one of the few who develop this capacity, the first step is to stop outsourcing your understanding of the world. Aragorn doesn't just sit in his castle. He travels Middle-earth for decades. He knows the world firsthand. Many people today, though, are more like Theoden, the king who locks himself in his halls and lets others tell him what is true and real. He's not welcome. Why should I welcome you? Now, once you are starting to see the world with your own eyes, you still need to overcome two kinds of distortions. The first you might be familiar with — that's negative projection. Negative projection is when we take personal traits that we're ashamed of in ourselves and call them out in other people. You see, Boromir do it here as he accuses Frodo. You will take the rage of Sauron! You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all! But there's another lesser-known but equally dangerous kind of projection — that's positive projection. This is when we allow our fear that we're inadequate or undeserving of better treatment to create situations where we exaggerate other people's positive qualities. This is what happens when Frodo insists on trusting Gollum which he obviously should not. I want to help him, Sam. Why? Because I have to believe he can come back. We positively project onto others because we fear having no other option and being alone if we admit that someone isn't right for us. This can occur in hiring and friendships but it is incredibly common in romantic relationships. If you've ever seen someone or been the one who missed a bunch of red flags, positive projection is likely what was happening. Now, these types of projections fade naturally as you commit to a process called shadow work that is reclaiming the disowned aspects of yourself both good and bad. If you're interested, let me know in the comments. I can go deeper into this topic in another video. For now, though, we can take a small aspect of shadow work which is also the third foundational piece of clear seeing and that is developing courage in the form of openness to feeling. Many of us have made unconscious vows about what we will feel. I will never again feel weak. I will never again feel that afraid. I will not feel that shame. I'm gonna fight you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, father. These vows create compulsive behaviors that help us avoid situations where those feelings might arise and then our lives begin to bend around those things which we refuse to feel. So maybe you avoid checking your bank account after a spending spree or the scale if you haven't been to the gym. For me, I couldn't even look at some of my old YouTube videos because I didn't want to feel ashamed of them. And I want to give you a charisma tip of the day. Try to do one of these every single day. But in psychologically disowning those videos, I sat my own motivation to create new ones. And it was after watching them and feeling both how proud I was of them and how far I'd come since making them that I was inspired to make this video. So sit and look and feel what happens when you open your eyes to what you've been avoiding. It can transform your life. And while the confidence born from this process may not be in your face as the young heroes, it doesn't burn out. It gets brighter over time until even the doubters can't help but acknowledge it. Now, King energy, archetypes, and shadow work are all huge topics and I've got quite a bit more to say about all of them. So if you found this video helpful and you'd like more, please let me know in the comments. If you want more in the meantime, you can also check out King, Warrior, Magician, Lover by Moore and Gillette which is a fantastic book that covers these four archetypes in more detail.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, you'll learn 5 techniques to immediately reduce anxiety and stop overthinking. Then we'll cover 5 mindset shifts to let you instantly feel more confident. The first trick when you're feeling anxious is to use your body to calm your nerves. We all know that emotions affect your body language. What most people don't realize is this connection is a two-way street. Your body language has a big impact on how you feel. Listen to Tony Robbins explain how he uses this as the first step he takes when helping someone with depression. If you take that same person and you change the tempo at which they move, you bring their shoulders back and change their breathing pattern. If they make a faster gesture, if they speak more rapidly, it fires off a different biochemistry in you. Anxiety works the same way. This means purposely taking on calm, confident body language will actually help you feel more calm and confident. You can also use anxiety-reducing breathing techniques. There's a ton of breathing techniques out there, but there's two we found are by far the most effective. The first is the Navy SEAL method of box breathing. Pre-buds, we learned a breathing technique called 4x4 breathing. It's a 4-count in-breath, a 4-count hold, a 4-count exhale, 4-count hold. It's going to keep you from panicking. If we let that worry, anxiety, and stress, if we let it overcome us, that's what it leads to is panic. The second breathing technique we recommend is Dr. Andrew Huberman's extended exhale. So if you want to calm down quickly, you need to make your exhales longer and or more vigorous than your inhales. Both of these breathing techniques signal your autonomic nervous system to slow your heart rate down and stop sending panic stress signals to your body. That's how you can use your body to calm your mind. You can also use your mind to calm your mind. The first way you can do this is the snap method. Anytime you catch yourself dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, snap your fingers. Obviously, this works best in private, but once you build the habit, you can even give yourself a mental snap when you're with other people. The goal is for the snap to be a reminder to come back to the present moment, because it is impossible to be anxious and fully present at the same time. This trick of anchoring back to the present moment is how Chris Evans got over his anxiety about playing the role of Captain America. Being present is a superpower, but learning to consistently live in the present moment can take months or years of meditating to achieve. Definitely a worthwhile pursuit, but you're probably hoping for something a bit faster. Luckily, there is a faster way you can use your mind to reduce anxiety. Gratitude Anchoring When you're grateful, you can't be worried. You can't be fearful. You may think you need some huge win or big achievement in order to be grateful for your current life, but the real trick is learning to be grateful for something every day no matter what your life looks like. For example, listen to how Ellen tries to frame Chris Pratt's life for him, emphasizing the quote-unquote big wins. Now, listen to how Chris reframes her worldview and explains what he's grateful for. The easiest way to build a gratitude habit and wire your mind to anchor to gratitude is with a daily morning journal. Take just three to five minutes each morning and write down three things you're grateful for. This can be anything from family and friends you're happy you have in your life to more simple things like enjoying the smell of your morning coffee. If you had a terrible week and you're struggling to think of anything to be grateful for, you can use the stoic practice of negative visualization to recapture your gratitude. Sam Harris describes it well in this next clip. The goal here is to take your focus away from the happiness gap, the gap between your life and what you wish your life was, and help you appreciate what you already have. One important caveat here with gratitude, don't let your attempts at gratitude turn into feelings of guilt. No matter how blessed your life is, it is normal to experience negative emotions sometimes. So don't let your gratitude practice turn into a repression practice or a practice where you beat yourself up thinking, I have so much to be grateful for, I'm a bad person for feeling negative feelings. Now, if you're in a really high-stress situation and you're still feeling nervous even after doing everything we've covered so far, there is one other thing you can do. Own it with a smile. Watch this next clip for a great example of what this looks like. Your ideal is probably to not feel nervous, but if you do feel nervous, the worst thing you can do is be ashamed of that nervousness. Shame does not make anxiety go away. So if you find yourself really caught in your head or tripping over your words, it's okay to simply call out your own nervousness with a smile. Okay, so those are tools you can use in the moment when you're already feeling anxious. Now let's talk about five mindset shifts that can help minimize your anxiety. The first mindset shift is counterintuitive. It's to accept your anxiety. Just because you feel your heart rate increase or a bit of adrenaline, that doesn't mean things are going wrong. Some of the greatest performers of all time got nervous. There is power in recognizing that it's okay that you feel nervous. No one is immune to fear. So don't aim to be fearless. Aim to be someone who can feel fear and still take action. Ironically, accepting that it's okay to be nervous will help calm your nerves. Now, that said, there are degrees of anxiety. It can range from I feel a little anxious to really crippling, something that can hold down your whole life. So let's go through more mindset shifts that can get you closer to the former. Let's start by stating something obvious. Performance anxiety comes from feeling pressure to perform. Duh. Well, that pressure to perform comes from feeling like you need a certain outcome. If you can release that need, you release the pressure to perform. Listen to Russell Brand describe it well here when talking about how he calms his nerves before big performances or a big podcast. Now, when I arrive here and I see these players, like even wordlessly, my emotions inform me. Oh, what's it going to be like? Is everyone going to like me? What's going to happen to me? Who are these men? What's happening here? Like all this stuff starts happening. And then another part of me goes, you've got nothing to get. No one can give you anything. You're all right. You don't have to be afraid. For a lot of people, that idea of you have nothing you need can be tough because you want to change your external circumstances. You want more friends, more dates, a better job. So how can you pursue those things without feeling pressure to perform and getting performance anxiety? One way you can do that is to shift from an outcome mindset to a process mindset. So if you have anxiety approaching someone attractive, you would shift the goal from making them like you to simply taking pride in starting a conversation, no matter how it goes. That's something totally in your control. This will get you into more conversations, which funny enough, will help you eventually learn how to have them go well. This is how many successful actors dealt with the anxiety of constantly facing rejection from auditions. More than anything, more than a one random successful audition, I think just as consistently putting out as much good work as possible in audition form and casting form is a step in the right direction. Another example would be on a first date. Shift your goal from I want this person to like me to I want to have fun on this date and assume that if you focus on having fun, you'll eventually end up dating the right people and polarizing the wrong people away from you. That takes us to our next mindset that reduces social anxiety. Be willing to polarize. Don't try to make every single person you meet like you. Tom Hardy is probably the best celebrity to watch to see what this attitude looks like in practice. For an example, listen to him answer the interview question, What kind of snack would you be? Another trick to reduce anxiety is to reframe the situations that make you nervous. Here's Hugh Jackman explaining how he does this for his auditions. For instance, if you find yourself entering a date or an interview feeling pressured to perform or impress, make sure you find time to ask questions designed to see if you, like them, too. This will reframe the situation in your mind and give you more confidence. Another way you can reduce performance anxiety is to zoom out. Instead of focusing on getting one particular job or one particular person to like you, focus on becoming the type of person who has options. So if job interviews make you nervous, focus on building the charisma skills to interview well, and focus on building work-related skills that you know will make you a standout applicant. Then interviews will be something you actually look forward to because you know you'll crush them. Or if dating makes you nervous, don't worry about making any specific person like you. Instead, focus on growing into someone who many people want to be with. The fastest way I know of to build a life with options is to develop your charisma. Becoming world-class in most skills takes years, sometimes decades. But you can achieve exceptional growth in charisma in just a month or two. Most people simply never try to learn it or, if they do, they don't know how to do it effectively. If you want the fastest way I know of to develop your charisma so you can quickly start living a life with less anxiety and more options, you may like our program Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program that tells you exactly what to do every day so that 30 days from now you radiate confidence and charisma naturally, without even thinking about it. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. I was at a low point in my life when I began the course, suffering from heartbreak. The trifecta of healing myself was exercise, therapy, and Charisma University. Whereas before, I was always one of the most socially awkward within a group, I am now one of, if not the, most charismatic and confident. And I'm only a little over halfway through the course. I recommend this to anyone suffering from social anxiety like me, who is sick of the dead air that often appears in conversations. Another member wrote in, I wasn't truly confident. I was constantly seeking validation and cared too much about other people's opinions. But now my life has improved tremendously because of Charisma University. I find it way easier to connect with people, to have great interactions, and to be happy even if things don't go the way I want them to. Taking this course has been one of the most impactful decisions of my life. I can't recommend it enough. And lastly, one member writes, I am way more confident now, having gone through the daily action guides, and I can see a big difference in the attention and respect that I get. It makes life so much more fun. I don't think it's an overstatement to say charisma is literally a gateway to anything you want in life, so thank you for making Charisma University. We guarantee Charisma University will change your life. That means you can take the entire course, and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund from right inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"In today's video, we're going to show you 7 bad charisma habits that will consistently make people dislike you. By becoming aware of these mistakes, you can hopefully avoid making them. The first bad habit is vulnerability dropping. That's instantly making a joke when someone opens up vulnerably. Watch this quick clip for a brutal example with a soldier who thought he had saved a friend who ended up dying in battle. Some people aren't comfortable with strong emotions, so they use humor to quickly try to change the tone of the conversation. This can make the person sharing with you feel hurt and unsafe. There are times when it can be helpful to use humor to lift someone's mood, but make sure you're doing it for them, not because you're uncomfortable. Often, you're better off simply listening and making someone feel heard and understood. The other common mistake to avoid when someone shares something with you is conversational narcissism, relating everything back to yourself and consistently trying to put the focus onto you. Watch these next two clips for a great cringey example from The View. The conversation starts with Sunny expressing empathy for the people who are suffering because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now watch Joy Behar use what is called a shift response to shift the focus of the conversation to herself. This is an extreme version of a shift response, but they happen in conversation all the time. A common example would be if someone says something like, sorry I haven't seen you recently, things have been really rough at work. A supportive response would be something like, no problem, do you want to talk about it? You're showing the other person that you care and are interested in hearing more. A common shift response would be, oh my god, I know exactly what you mean, my work has been awful lately, and then launching into a story about your own job. A shift response isn't always a bad thing, sometimes sharing your experiences makes people feel like they aren't alone, but if the only way you respond to things is with a story about yourself, it will eventually repel people. There's another common way people hog the conversational spotlight, question cutting, asking a question and then interrupting the answer. Talking over each other is commonplace in a group of excited friends and isn't always a bad thing, but if you interrupt right after you ask a question, it's almost always frustrating. The good news is, it's extremely easy to avoid this mistake. If you ask someone a question, let them answer it. There's another mistake related to asking questions that you also want to avoid, and that's trampling boundaries. This sounds obvious, but you'd be shocked how common it is. Here's a quick example of what it looks like. For context, Rob Gronkowski's teammate Aaron Hernandez was arrested for murder around the time of this interview. You would think that Rob's made it clear he wants to move on to a new topic, but watch what the interviewer does next. Here's another example so you can see how this might happen without you meaning to upset someone. It starts with Jim Norton asking a very personal question, but in a respectful way. Now watch what happens when Dylan McDermott draws a boundary and says that the topic is off limits. Similar to vulnerability dropping, it's possible Doug Stanhope was trying to add levity to the conversation because he was uncomfortable, or even because he saw Dylan was uncomfortable and he was trying to help. It's possible to mean well when you cross someone's boundary, but you're much better off simply respecting the boundary and moving on. Even without a boundary beforehand, this is a classic mistake people make, trying to make a joke and accidentally making someone angry. With certain close friends you know like dark humor, nothing has to be off limits. But especially with people you're first meeting, it can be a mistake to tease sensitive topics. You'd think this is obvious, but again, it's surprisingly common. The mistake here is getting so focused on trying to make a group laugh, you don't pause to consider how the focus of your joke will feel. If you're going to tease someone for a laugh, tease them about something they're unlikely to be insecure or sensitive about. The most likable way to tease someone is to tease their strengths. You say something so obviously untrue that it ends up drawing attention to a strength of theirs. Watch this next clip for another example with Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth, this time guessing Avengers based on bicep photos. Here's Scarlett Johansson with a similar joke during playground insults. Your biceps look like Thanksgiving turkeys. Now let's talk about a mistake that often comes with good intentions — giving unsolicited advice. As an example, watch George from Impulsive give the Island Boys financial advice for if their music career flames out. George isn't a rude guy, he's genuinely trying to be helpful here, but you can see it makes the Island Boys angry because they didn't ask what to do if their music career doesn't work, so the advice feels insulting. It's great to want to help people, but you'll get a much better response if you ask if someone wants your advice before you give it. You'll avoid making them angry and they're more likely to listen to you because they've opted in. The last mistake we'll cover today is instant aggression. It's okay to stand up for yourself and draw boundaries, but some people respond to the slightest accidental offense with way too much hostility. Here's a great example of this from a first date. Now notice how she responds. You can see her continued hostility makes the guy very uncomfortable. Often, this instant aggression comes from assuming negative intent where there isn't any. You're much better off assuming someone's being positive until they explicitly prove otherwise. Here's a funny example of what that might look like from the movie The King of Staten Island. Even if you think someone is being rude, you don't have to respond aggressively right away. You can start with a soft boundary where you use a friendly tone to call out what you don't like. This at least gives you a chance to get back to a pleasant conversation afterwards. Listen to Taylor Swift respond to John Cleese here for an example. Now with all of the charisma mistakes in this video and pretty much every charisma mistake beyond these, the most painful part is that you almost never realize you're doing it. Very few people set out to make people dislike them. And if you do accidentally have a few bad charisma habits, you can end up ruining a first impression you really wanted to go well, missing out on promotions at work, or becoming the odd one out in your friend group. It sucks. The flip side of that is also true. With just a little work, you can build fantastic habits that let you be your authentic self in a way that makes people love and respect you. If you want help with that, you might like our video program, Charisma University. It's guaranteed to give you more friends, more dates, better work relationships, and most importantly, high self-esteem and true confidence. If you try it and don't like it, you have 60 days to give yourself a full refund from right inside the course just by pushing a button. We've had over 14,000 people go through the program so far and the average score people give it is a 9 out of 10. People write in saying things like, I've already watched a lot of the YouTube channel and loved it, but Charisma University's action guide really changed my life. Insane social experiences I never thought I'd have and work-wise, I ended up getting a best-selling author as a mentor. I'm so glad I joined. Loving the course, I've liked a girl for over a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we're dating. By sticking with Charisma University, I've had the confidence to make groups of new friends and land a promotion. I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I had hands down the best interview out of everybody and they would love to have me at their program. The entire course will only take you 30 days. If you start today, you'll be getting dramatically different reactions from people within just one week.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"It's usually the moments where we're trying to make people like us that actually wind up making them hate us instead. And that's sometimes because we want to show that we're cool or smart. There's a time when you snuck into the room to see what the— I sneaked into the room. Snuck isn't a word, Conan, and you went to Harvard and you should know that. What the hell? Look right here. Snuck. Past and past part of sneak. And other times, it's because we're trying to cover up for a previous mistake. So in this video, I want to use Beast Games to reveal five rage-ducking behaviors that can turn a recoverable blunder into people totally losing respect for you. But before we go any further, don't be mean to this guy. Reality TV is not the real world. We don't know what's cut, so give him some grace. First off, one phrase that can destroy your respect if it's used improperly is, I had to. And obviously, not every time since it's a super common phrase, so let me give you some context. In Beast Games, the final 10 contestants have an opportunity to divide $1,000,000 between them. The catch is that they each go one by one with each person taking as much from the prize pool as they want and no one is watching them as they do this. The first person goes and takes one-tenth, which is an even share of the $1,000,000. But the next two take much more than an even share. Everyone else is left with almost nothing. And what's crazy is that only one of the guys who took more than his share gets most of the group's anger, and it's in part because of how he handles the aftermath. Check out how he starts with the phrase, I had to. I'm sorry, guys. I had to put my family first, but at the end of the day, I had to do what I had to do. I don't know when else that opportunity was going to come knocking on my door, and I had to take it. I had to, along with the other four phrases in this video, kills his respect for the rest of his time on the show. And now, obviously, this is an extreme situation with a lot of money on the line, but it is a guarantee in normal life that you're going to do things that upset other people. Maybe something small like skipping a group hangout, or maybe you're critiquing someone or even firing them for not performing at work. Even though it might feel like pretending not to have a choice will help, a much stronger way to command respect is by saying, I decided to, like, I would have loved to see you, but I decided to spend time with my family, or I decided to let you go. This can bring out more upset feelings in the moment. But even when people are disappointed, they respect those who communicate difficult things with this kind of clarity. Now, our next phrase is extremely tempting to use, and it's every derivative of, it's not the same, or what I did is different. In this case, players are pointing out that player 566 criticized another player for a move that he felt was selfish and low integrity. You should have chosen someone that you knew and that you confided. I'm sorry, Dino. That's just the way I feel. You chose her to save yourself. That was a shitty thing to do. When other players bring this up, though, 566 tries to argue that his situation is totally different. It's a different scenario. Oh, it is? Yes, it's a very different scenario. Hey, that's called rationalization. Because he plotted someone for his benefit. He used someone as a pawn. Notice there that if you immediately jump to defend yourself, people tend to shut you out. Hey, that's called rationalization. Because he plotted— So instead of immediately denying an accusation of hypocrisy, it's often better to ask yourself if there are similarities and reply with, yeah, I see how those things are similar before pointing to the ways that you feel they're different. That will actually make the other person more open to seeing your point of view rather than just writing you off as defensive. Now, the next group of phrases that drives people crazy and kills your respect is everything to do with redirecting blame with phrases like, what about you? Or what about them? For instance, after everyone is furious with him, player 566 gathers everyone together to share that other players have a secret alliance. I may seem like the enemy because of the decision I made, and I'm not the enemy. I was told by someone in this room that they are plotting against me, and my suspicion was confirmed. And when I say they, I'm going to introduce you to they. Now, it is sometimes the case that while people are upset with you, there's another big issue that needs to be raised. In these cases, the best way forward is to wait until the conversation about you has ended and then say, okay, do you feel complete here? Because there's another topic I'd like to bring up. When you do this, it feels like you're not bringing up someone else's issues to escape from your own and people are much more likely to listen. But rushing to a deflection usually gets you none of what you want which is exactly what happens here. You are feeding your family by stealing food from the community. I hear you, but do I understand you? No. Another sneaky group of phrases that you need to avoid are insincere disclaimers. An insincere disclaimer is when someone says that they're not doing something like I'm not doing X or I'm not doing Y like this. I'm not sharing this information to get the target off my back because it's there. I'm not trying to justify why I made my decision. You know I'm not here to convince you. And if this is insincere, they'll then proceed to do the exact same thing they just said they're not doing all without owning it. I'm not in this for material things. I'm 50 years old. I have a three-year-old and a six-year-old. You know that. I want time and that will afford me the opportunity to build more memories with them. Love you, JC. Love you, JC. We see an undeniable version of this when 566 tries to bribe another player to vote for him and then immediately backtracks when she doesn't bite at his offer. What is my vote to you worth? If it's all that you're voting for is for money, then I don't want the vote. Of course, no. And that's exactly what I wanted to hear. I wanted to just make sure that we're still on the same page. And this is especially obvious since right before this, he's trying to bribe other players with no mention of this being some sort of same-page test. Hey, Mikey. It's JC. If I throw 10K your way, are you willing to vote for me? Yeah, let me make some phone calls and then I'll call you back. Okay. So this boundary poking where you ask for something and then immediately disown it when it's not well-received is one of the fastest ways to lose people's respect. So instead of denying it when we do things that others might not like or agree to, a much better strategy is just to say, I want and own our desire. I want you to keep me on the show. I want your guys' forgiveness. I want you to get this target off my back. I want to pay for you to vote for me. You're not forcing the other person. You're just saying what you want. And if you try to deny what you're doing instead, you might trick someone once and seem impartial which can, yes, help you persuade them. But over time, they will see through this game and they will lose respect and trust. Once you've lost that respect, doing any kind of deal, having any kind of relationship gets very expensive as 566 finds out. So in the event that you wanted me to vote for you, you'd have to give me $150,000. Now there is a big caveat here because while clearly stating what you want is important to building respect, it doesn't guarantee you're going to get it. So when you're doing it, it generally helps if you pair it with this next point which is to not ask for empathy before offering it especially in situations where you've acted selfishly. So the phrase that you're going to want to avoid here is you have to understand or I want you to understand. I'm not trying to justify why I made my decision. I just want you guys to understand and I want you to know that I may seem like the enemy because of the decision I made and I'm not the enemy. Now, we can't see everything that happened in the edit but it is telling that we don't see any questions from 566 to the others after the betrayal like how are you guys feeling right now or is there something that you'd like me to know or do you think that there's something I'm not understanding about what I did. You don't have to give everyone what they ask for but if you don't open up to understand them, your attempts to explain yourself and get understood will usually fall on deaf ears. I don't want to be out here. People won't even look at me and I get it. You can't be negative. You had your choice to make. Now, you might be thinking this guy was doomed when he took the money and that's fair but actually, we see people in the same day make selfish decisions that get others eliminated and they do it without losing respect. For instance, when one player lies to get to the final round, he's immediately asked about it. 9-7-4. Why did you lie? He doesn't put it on his family. He answers the question briefly, owns that, yes, he did lie, and expresses remorse without minimizing what he did. I did this purely for strategy to move on to the next round and I'm sorry that I lied. And watch how quickly he is forgiven and respected. Listen, I forgive you but I don't play like that. I can respect it. That was tough. That was tough. This is what happens when you take responsibility and this whole video illustrates a sad confusion that so many have. So often, we think that if we can just avoid other people thinking that we're bad, things will go better for us but the sneaky things that we do to try to make people see us as good only work to make those people dislike and distrust us. So taking responsibility and allowing people to be angry, upset, or hurt by you while listening to them without trying to talk them out of it actually winds up being one of the strongest ways to move through life and command respect. And the cool thing here is that someone demonstrates a version of this on the show. He shows how to actually win back respect if you've done something that upsets people. For context, although it wasn't as much, player 831 took more than his fair share of the remainder of the money. I want to take $7,272. The first thing that he did was own what he'd done quickly. And I need to tell you guys, I took more than $4,330. I took $7,200. Okay. You know? We all took $3,600. I'm just letting you know. And he didn't deny his decision throughout the day. I'm not too dissimilar from you guys. I chose more than I should have. Then when it came time to play the game, which allowed people to make bribes and transfer money, he stopped with what he felt was underhanded behavior, refusing to pay off another player for a vote to get through to the next round. You get my vote if you give me everything you got. I think it's a little dirty. Then he made a move to make exact amends, including rectifying the amount that was damaged, speaking to his remorse, and owning his mistake. I took more than I should have, and now I'm making my penance. I just said, you guys, $7,5750. That was the excess amount I took over what I should have taken. It'll even everything out, and it'll make me feel much better. It was eating me up last night. It was stupid. I'll earn it the right way. That was really nice of you. Oh, dude, thank you. Thank you. Now, what happened after he did all this? All but two people, including everyone he apologized to, voted for him, and he moved on to the next round to win $5 million. So even though it seems like it might cost you, taking responsibility for the things that you've done that are out of alignment and owning them is actually a much cheaper way to succeed in life than by ducking responsibility. And even if it wasn't, it just feels better to let other people have their reactions to you without trying to control them. Now, if you're wanting to command respect in any room you walk into, you might be interested in our program, Charisma University.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Johnny Depp's relaxed confidence on the stand has helped make public perception around his trial with Amber Heard pretty one-sided but as many other witnesses have shown, staying calm and confident is not easy under that kind of pressure which is why, in this video, we'll be covering five things that Johnny has done and that you can do to radiate extreme confidence that makes others trust and like you even in high-pressure situations. As a caveat, confidence does make others trust you but it doesn't mean that someone is necessarily telling the truth. In another video, we may talk about lie detection in this trial but this video is just intended to break down confidence under pressure. So first off, you can create and demonstrate confidence by controlling the cadence of a conversation. The easiest way to do this is by letting silence sit when you need to think. Just make sure that when you do finally speak, you don't apologize for the time that you've taken and just carry on normally. And you don't remember the television breaking, do you? I remember there was a coffee cup stuck into the screen. Slowing things down also allows you to maintain non-reaction-seeking body language. That's body language that does not ask the other person for a signal that your message is being received as intended. Now, it's easiest to see non-reaction-seeking body language in contrast so let's take a look at some examples of reaction-seeking body language. Watch here as one witness lifts his shoulders and reveals his palms in his gesture that communicates, I'm overwhelmed. This gesture is fine when done subtly but when exaggerated, it's felt as if you're pleading that the question asker would stop pressing down their current path. Another example of reaction-seeking body language can be seen in Amber's checking in with the jury especially during highly emotional moments. These secretive glances were often timed with a pause in her story as she seemingly gauged the jury's response to what she was saying. They wouldn't remember her. Objection calls for speculation. I'll sustain the objection. Smithereens just going into the wall. I remember looking around the room, not wanting to move. Now, seeking a reaction from an audience and checking in with them does not mean that someone is lying but it does demonstrate a lack of confidence in how people are going to receive whatever is being said. That is why people check in to see if there's a favorable audience reaction so that they may feel secure. On the other hand, non-reaction-seeking body language does not request validation from a listener and as a result, it makes you come across as confident in what you're saying which causes others to buy into your reality. Johnny Depp demonstrated non-reaction-seeking body language through almost all of his testimony. For instance, when challenging the defense about an article written about him, he did not look to the jury to see if his point had landed with them. It's entitled, Johnny Depp, Friends and Family Seriously Concerned About Him, Here's Why. Yes, how did they know? The next article from May 1st, 2017. If you want to implement this in your own life, focus on checking in a bit less often with your audience no matter who they are. This means resisting the temptation to immediately scan across a group after you've told a joke not just to check who's laughing. Also, you can let silence sit after you've made a point in a debate. Either way, not checking in with the audience communicates that you have full faith in what you are saying or doing. This takes us to our third point which is to catch and refuse conversational frames that you do not agree with. Now, frames are the unspoken assumptions and rules built into any communication. In a conflict, someone may ask you a question where answering directly means accepting a frame that makes you look bad. So to defend yourself, you shouldn't respond to the content of a question but to its frame even when it's not spoken aloud. Now, this is much easier in an example. So for instance, in the following clip, the defense is reading headlines with the implicit frame that these are credible sources. If Johnny answers the question's content of, am I reading this correctly, he would be allowing the frame that those are credible sources to go unchecked. So rather than answer the defense's question, Johnny responds to the frame of the question, again, with no reaction-seeking body language. It's entitled, Johnny Depp. Friends and family seriously concerned about him. Here's why. Yes. How did they know? The next article from May 1st, 2017, before Johnny Depp has a clear and epic sense of entitlement, ex-managers say, published in the Hollywood Reporter, correct? I was in a lawsuit with him, sir. When opposing counsel continued, Johnny called out the frame directly rather than answer the question at face value. The next article, also from May 10th, 2017, a year and a half before the op-ed was published, says Johnny Depp reportedly drank heavily and was constantly late on the new Pirates movie set. Did I read that right? You did, reportedly. The next article, also from May 10th, 2017, Mr. Depp, please just respond to the question that I'm asking you. What's your question, sir? The next document. Now, in your life, rather than calling out frames you disagree with like Johnny, oftentimes, the most confident response is simply to calmly assert your own frame. This is what Amber actually did with the pledge slash donate discrepancy. For context, Amber stated that she donated $7 million of her divorce settlement, all of it, to charity. There was a divorce settlement, you got $7 million. People were saying this is all about the money but then you did something that twisted that whole argument. What did you do with that money? $7 million in total was donated to — I split it between the ACLU and Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. Later, though, it came out that she had not donated the money and had merely pledged it meaning it was sitting in her account for her to spend as she pleased. Now, that lie could ruin her credibility and break the case so she came prepared with a frame that would depict her as not having lied. That frame was that donated and pledged mean the same thing. Now, personally, I found this ridiculous and suspect the jury did, too. But from a strength of frame perspective, Amber did as well as she could in those circumstances by calmly asserting her own frame over and over again. Sitting here today, Ms. Hurd, you still haven't donated the $7 million divorce settlement to charity. Isn't that right? Incorrect. I pledged the entirety. You testified under oath that, quote, the entirety of your divorce settlement was donated to charity, end quote, didn't you? That's correct. I pledged the entirety. That statement wasn't true. It is true. I pledged the entirety to charity. The statement... When you say you buy a house, you don't pay for the entire house at one time. Now, conversational frame analysis can be really fun but in your life, you're probably not going to consciously notice these frames in real time. But when you go slow and adopt more secure body language, you will naturally find yourself less caught up in other people's frames and more confident asserting your own. Moving along to our next point, confident people are able to control the emotional tone of an interaction by introducing that tone themselves. So for instance, they're able to make things a bit more serious by sharing a vulnerable story in an otherwise goofy friend group. Or in the case of a very serious trial, they're able to introduce humor to cut through the tension like Johnny. You poured yourself a mega pint of red wine, correct? A mega pint. Showing the emotional tone of an interaction demonstrates leadership and a tremendous amount of confidence. As mentioned, this can be towards a much more serious tone as we saw Johnny's lawyer do repeatedly when cross-examining Amber. That's correct. I pledged the entirety. No. Misheard. My questions. Your counsel will have time to redirect you after. But the more commonly applicable way to show confidence is by introducing humor into situations where people are being much more serious and literal and you can do this by just saying the opposite of what people expect. A haze of booze and hash, a marriage gone very wrong, and a lifestyle he can't afford inside the trials of Johnny Depp. Did I read that right? You did. You should read the article. And the last one. The last one. So in your life, when someone at a party asks what you do for work, you can come up with a playful answer before telling them your actual job or if they ask who you know there, say no one. You just heard music and decided to come hang out. Shifting the tone of a conversation from literal answers to humor obviously will make people laugh but it also gets them more interested in your honest answer since you're demonstrating that you've got uncommon levels of confidence. And this takes us to the last point which is actually a core tenet of confidence that makes doing all the behaviors we already mentioned much easier. Confidence is easier to feel when you have lots of positive reference experiences so you want to purposely create experiences that feel like social wins. Now since Johnny Depp is a movie star, he hasn't had to do this. People have responded enthusiastically to him almost all of his life without any particular effort but it still had the effect of making him comfortable moving at his own slower pace and displaying non-reaction-seeking body language. Fame made people respond well to him which increased his confidence which made people respond even better and on and on and on. You can get the same feedback loop working in your favor without the fame by creating and appreciating small wins. That may mean being proud for cracking a joke to a cashier even if it doesn't go over as you might hope or for giving yourself just a little bit extra room for thoughtful silence before answering a tough question in an argument or an interview. When you allow yourself to appreciate those small wins instead of focusing on what you could have done better, it feeds that positive reference loop. Over the long term, you get more and more confident because you have so many memories of feeling good when you put yourself out there socially. It doesn't matter that the wins were small, simply that you let yourself feel them. And if you're looking for the fastest way to create those social wins, you might be interested in our course, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program that guides you on exactly what small things to do each day to massively build your confidence and charisma. Over 9,000 people have already joined and here is what just a few of them have had to say about it. The first is from a guy who was interviewing for new jobs. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor pulled me aside and said that I, hands down, had the best interview out of everybody and they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. Another person wrote about their social life saying, It has been truly incredible. I've instantly had results that seem insane. So many more meaningful connections, my friendships have improved, and my interactions with total strangers are a new, exciting, fulfilling thing. I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system. And this last one is from someone who says that the course has been life-changing and he says, Your course has been life-changing to the point where I wake up in the mornings feeling like I've been transferred to a new person's body, the person I kept dreaming about becoming before I found Charisma on Command. It is incredible. I found myself and I found what makes me happy. And you can see more success stories like these in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do so, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all and I make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 because I want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value out of the course. Otherwise, you can just refund. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead, click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course, get a ton out of it — introverts, extroverts, men and women from all over the globe — and I would love for you to do the same.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Alright everybody, we're trying something a little bit exciting and new today which is we're going to be making a tier list of Game of Thrones characters ranked by their charisma. So the first thing to keep in mind is we're not judging charisma in modern day times, this isn't who you would like to sit down and get a beer with. It's Game of Thrones charisma, which means are you persuasive, do your plans work out, and that might make you a very bad person. You could still be high charisma in the Game of Thrones world. Keep in mind this is just for fun, so if you don't like where I rank someone, please don't firebomb me. Alright, let's start with the first one. We're going with F tier first, and I thought a lot about this. I think probably the lowest of the low charisma style in the Game of Thrones world for me is Gregor Clegane, the Mountain. Guy doesn't talk, he's basically used as a tool by Tywin Lannister for the majority to just kill his enemies. Yes, he survives fairly long until he's made into an undead monster, but that to me is not exactly high persuasion or charisma. So bottom of the tier list, Gregor Clegane. Another Lannister lackey making up our second lowest spot is going to be Maester Pycelle. Now, I give him credit, he makes it to the small council, he stays loyal to Tywin for that, okay, good job, but he's continually outwitted by everyone around him. Tyrion plays him like a fool, exposes him, and he just doesn't do so well. I believe he winds up getting stabbed by a bunch of kids in the end, even though he does make it to a rightful age. Maybe he deserves D. The next one up, I feel confident in my F tier ranking, this is Viserys Targaryen. So he goes out in Book 1, he's got a huge head, he believes that despite the fact that he has no sort of measurable power, that people should react and respond to him as if he were a powerful king, and that leans to his own demise. When he walks in, demands an army, demands a throne, and gets a pot of gold poured on his head. So he's solidly F tier, I feel safe in that one. Next up, someone who I don't know if this is going to be divisive, but I think when you look at the plot, she ruins everything for the Starks, and this is Catelyn Stark. So Stark Mama, first off, convinces Ned to go south to King's Landing, which is not a very good idea. Stark guys do not do well when they get there. She kidnaps Tyrion, which starts the entire war, then lets him go. She lets Jaime Lannister go, which puts Robb in a very difficult position with his bannermen. The only thing that it seems like she does wisely is advise Robb not to trust Theon, which she is unpersuasive and ultimately doing. So she really kind of messes things up with her advice and actions throughout the story. I put her at F tier charisma, even though she seems like a well-meaning lady. And then I have to say, the next F tier, probably my favorite or second favorite character is Theon Greyjoy. And he just, I mean, he does, I think, emotionally, character-wise, appear to redeem himself by the end of the series, if he's not there yet in the books. He's working on it, but he's so bad. The decisions he makes are terrible. He sacks Winterfell. He can't hold it. He gets himself in a horrible position with Reek Ramsey. In the TV show, he runs away, doesn't recognize that the guy who he's run away with is, in fact, his captor. There's just, he makes horrible, horrible decisions throughout. Low F tier charisma. Moving up now to the people slightly above, the D tiers. These are the people who aren't the worst, maybe have a redeeming piece, but are still pretty bad. And for this, I start with Joffrey, right? We're not going to get to every single character, but I think he deserves, I mean, he's maybe F tier. But I gave him D because he actually is, if you go back to early seasons and even read some of the scenes, he's very persuasive and charming when he wants to be. Prior to becoming king, he really lays it on Sansa, makes her want to stay in the south, acts like he's this prince charming, kind of plays into the dream that he knows that she has. He knows how to play that charming prince. Now, very quickly, upon assuming power, he abuses it, makes enemies with everyone, and gets himself killed for it. So that's why he's D tier. But I think that if he had maintained a little bit of that humility, which made him play kinder than he actually was, he might have made it higher up in this list at least. The next one, I might be being harsh here, but I'm going to put Cersei. Cersei Lannister gets a D from me. And I know she survives a lot past a lot of the people who I might be ranking above her, but when I look at why, particularly in the books, it's made clear that the powers that be kind of like her in power, because she's this destabilizing force, so other people are operating around her, they just don't deal with her is kind of how she winds up in a position of power, not because she's making any brilliant power plays. Now, I would say the one example of this, which is shrewd, horrible, is when she blows up the Sept. That was quite well done. I give her crops for that. Maybe that bumps her up to C tier. But other than that, it seems to me that she survives mostly because she's not really truly enough of a political threat, enough for the other characters to handle earlier. Next one. Dead Ned. Ned Stark. D tier. Really nice guy. Seems like he'd be good to get that beer with, but in Westerosi charisma, I gotta give him a D. Poor decision-making throughout. Maybe prior to the series, he did some good stuff. Seemed to be very well-liked by his bannermen, which is why he gets a D, but as soon as he moves into the political arena, he's just outclassed by everyone around him. He trusts Littlefinger to his own death. He ignores the better advice of some people around him who tell him, you need to get out of here, this place isn't for you, and he winds up dead very early on in our story. So, sorry, Ned. We love you. And then last up, I give Janos Lent. Janos Lent was that guy who was the commander of the Watch. He got to that position of power, which is why I'm not giving him an F, but then very immediately blows it, gets kicked out by Tyrion, goes to the wall, mouths off to Jon, and gets his head cut off. So, that might even be F tier. That's some bad charisma. Moving up to C tier, I've saved this for some of our favorites here, and this might be contentious. We've got Jon Snow. I'm giving him a C tier. And I think, why does he get a C tier in my mind? Because he is very, I think, traditionally charismatic in that people around him, when they get to know him, admire him, like him, follow him. But at least in the books, where we end up is he's being stabbed by his own men. And if you read into it, we actually did a video on this, it's in large part because he lacks the ability to communicate why he's doing the things that he's doing. He's letting the wildlings through. He's incapable of making the Night's Watch understand that there are literal dead people coming for them and that this is in their best interest. He's brooding, he's non-communicative, and it gets him stabbed by several of his own men. But despite that, if you meet him in person, it seems like everybody really likes him. He just isn't good at communicating. He's a brooder. The next one, I didn't know where to place this. Because her story, I don't know how it's going to get there. But we're looking at Daenerys Targaryen, C tier for me. She is, at times, brilliantly inspiring. At other times, I don't understand why she's so cold and ruthless to the people around her. She seems to just be, I guess, that was kind of how she was asked to portray herself, Emilia Clarke, in some of the scenes. At the last scene that she has with Gendry where she starts off very unkind and then winds up giving him Storm's End, she seems to do that a lot. She's got this bad attitude, doesn't really make people around her feel good some of the time in her interactions. And then, of course, she just goes genocidal at the end of the series. I could see arguments for her being higher, for sure, given that she does wind up commanding all of these forces. But I think a large part of that is not due to her personality, but due to the fact that she's the one magical character that can walk into fire, walk out with three dragons. So, C tier for me. Moving up to B tier, this was the hardest one to fill out. I actually think, she's not a big political player, but I gave Ygritte B tier. And Ygritte, if you remember, is the redhead who is north of the wall that falls in love with Jon. I gave her B tier because, one, she's living in a harsh environment and seems to be, nobody is really taking advantage of her, which I think is impressive when she's living in that place. She's not the biggest, she's not the strongest, there's literal giants around her, but she stands her own ground. Second, she seems to be, with exception, she understands Jon, honestly. She's a good judge of character. She knows that Jon is going to probably betray her before they have that scene before they climb the wall where she says, I know you're still a crow. She's the one person that really gets, we didn't flip this guy that quick. It's hopeful thinking, wishful thinking that lets her trust Jon enough to where he actually does betray her. And then, even though he doesn't, she has the opportunity, at least in the show on a number of occasions, she doesn't kill him. And that's not for lack of knowing that that might be in her best interest, it's because she's emotionally compromised. So I give her a B tier for all of that. Next up, we have Jaime Lannister. I actually think that Jaime is far more cunning than he was portrayed in later seasons of the Dave and Dan version of Jaime who was kind of just a big dope who loves Cersei right there at the end. Where we leave him, in the books at least, he took Riverrun after, I don't know if it was months or years of a siege, bloodlessly, right? He made a couple threats about throwing a baby over, let Edmure in, and he took the castle completely bloodlessly. We're starting to see him use his head a lot more and it seems like that was there all along. He just relied on his family name and his sword hand to carry the day. He seems like he could have actually been a very astute political player but he wound up being a golden boy instead. I think he's got more smart moves to be made in the books. We didn't see a whole ton of them in the seasons but I'm holding out for that which is why I gave him a B tier. And then next up, I have Oberyn Martell. Now, Oberyn is probably the most regularly charismatic, right? When we think of charisma, everyone likes him. He seems to turn guys and girls like him very much. Sexually, he's got his pick of the litter when it comes to that. He's attractive, he's slick, he's got all of that going down and he actually makes interesting political plays, right? He comes to the capital, he winds up on the trial. He's got a seat there at the trial as a Prince of Dorne. He's weighing in on Tyrion and he gets what he wanted which is a sanctioned fight with the man who killed his sister. Now, it's his own hubris, his pride that busts him at the end but quite frankly, he wins the fight, right? He should have just stood three steps away and that was dumb but I could imagine him going on winning that fight. He's a little bit on the nose with accusing Tywin Lannister at the end there but you see what he's trying to do. He's trying to get a public confession that Tywin Lannister was the one who ordered the murder of the Dornish princesses. So he's got some political machinations going. I think his emotions get the better of him and that's why he has his premature death. Moving on now to the A tier. This is the cream of the crop. These are our movers and shakers in the world of Game of Thrones and again, I've left a couple people out. These were just the ones that grabbed me as the most interesting. So, I guess, I think, well, really, there's two families that make this up for me. Two main players. The first is going to be Tywin Lannister. Tywin, prior to the whole Game of Thrones series, he's a political genius. He comes in with the Mad King, sets everything straight, runs it. He's a little bit too good at his job, right? This is why he, I think, falls short of someone like Littlefinger because he lets it be known how powerful he is sometimes and he seems to have learned that lesson by the time he's in Game of Thrones. For instance, he gets the phrase to take the fall for the Red Wedding even when he orchestrated it, masterminded it, and provided them safety but the ones who are getting killed at the beginning of some of the books and who have all this North hatred are the phrase. It's not directed towards Tywin Lannister which is genius. I think one of the things that is, well, perhaps similar in the world of Game of Thrones is that the best thing that you can do when you have power is act powerless, right? Is act like you have nothing to do with it. He does a very good job of that throughout his life, at least in the books. He's a physical presence. We see him intimidate Joffrey. He runs the show as long as he's in town. He's the only one, really, who just completely handles Joffrey and overrules him, no problem. So Tywin Lannister, for me, solid A, pushing S tier. I didn't give him an S because he underestimates, underuses, and it ultimately kills him. which is his son, Tyrion, who I also give A tier too. If Tywin and Tyrion had teamed up, this would be the best duo that Westeros had ever seen, right? They would have been absolutely unstoppable. Tyrion, on the other hand, excellent frame control, right? Doesn't have Tywin's dominant stature, nature. We see him talk himself out of life or death situations on more than one occasion and he understands what other people want. We made a whole video about this and when he's talking, he doesn't say, you have to save me. What we see Littlefinger do, and it's the worst scene ever in the TV show. I do not think he's going to go out, but he says, please don't kill me, please, I've been so good. That's not how Tyrion talks. That's not how Tyrion tries to persuade people. He speaks to what is good for you and that's how he saves his own skin. That's how he gets out of the jail. That's how he convinces the mountain clans not to kill him. He talks to their own needs and it winds up propelling him forward. So absolutely A tier. He's got battle strategy. He's A pushing S. And then we have the other family. We have the Tyrells. And we have the matriarch of the Tyrells, Olenna Tyrell. Now, we don't see a ton from her in the books. She seems very clever in the scenes that we see from her at least in the TV show. But one, to be a matriarch in a patriarchal society is quite impressive. She's very old, right? She's achieved hyper-prominence in the society. And then she pulls this coup off essentially killing the king and is completely unsuspected. There are no negative ramifications that fall to her. They get a more manageable king who her daughter then begins to play like a fiddle. She's incredible. And then I've hinted at the final person for me in A tier is Margaery Tyrell. Margaery, again, if you have Oberyn being like the male charismatic standard who we might really like, Margaery is the one that would do the best in our world. I mean she's beautiful. She's likable. Everyone likes her. We've got the small folk who likes her who she gives back to. She's the only one who controls Joffrey in her own particular way which is not overt. She controls Joffrey by making him feel special, by convincing him that he can be loved by the masses, and in that way keeps a handle over him. Now, it's not necessarily easy for her to do but she does it and she remains undetected by Joffrey driving a wedge between him and his mother. Very, very impressive stuff. Unfortunately, her one downfall was underestimating the ruthlessness of Cersei. And I didn't give her mad charisma points for blowing up the set because I don't think that's necessarily genius political strategy because I think the political fallout of that would have been far worse than they showed in the TV show if you kill entire noble families in a fire that you're not at the trial. I think that that's where the show might have fallen short in having consequences to behaviors. That said, I give Margaery top marks. I think she might go out a similar way in the books. And now, the coveted. We've arrived at S-tier and I saved this. This was for those characters who were the most self-made. This was for the people who didn't come from noble houses but still amassed incredible amounts of power. So some of these will be able to guess and I think one might come as a bit of a surprise. So the first one, I mean, we have Littlefinger, perhaps the best player in the entire Game of Thrones. George talks about the difference. He says that there's actually a difference between how the show depicts Littlefinger and the books. In the books, he's so likable. Everybody likes him. In the TV shows, he's depicted as this character that they kind of put up with because he can help them but not in the books. He's so well-liked by everybody. He orchestrates a coup, gets Sansa out, is beginning to control the area. We see at the very end of and even in some of the scenes that have been leaked from Winds of Winter, he's still doing these brilliant plays where he's got people who are working for him, acting like they don't work for him, acting against him in order to consolidate. He's three steps ahead of everyone else and people do not realize, perhaps with the exception of Varys, how powerful he is which is, in the Game of Thrones, maybe the best thing you can do for yourself is cover your power tracks which takes us to the dueling side of that. We have Varys. So Varys, again, comes from nothing, right? He was a street urchin who winds up being master of whispers but that's not where his power ends. He actually is making some pretty incredible moves and is only intercepted by Littlefinger a couple of times. He actually negotiates and gets Ned out of jail, we believe, at the end. He's working on a deal to get him out and then it seems like Littlefinger has gotten into Joffrey's ears, convinced him he shouldn't go easy on his enemies and Ned gets his head cut off. There's a number of things, and this is why I put Littlefinger slightly ahead of Varys, that are plans that Varys had enacted that are only intercepted in the last second by Littlefinger. He seems to be the only one who is on his level. Hyper power player, incredible. And then the one person that you may not have guessed up here, self-made, did it all, and quite frankly if we'd had scenes of him doing it, it would have been confounding to understand, is Mance Rayder. Mance Rayder is the king beyond the wall and what he did, I don't even know that you could depict it, like how would you show a scene of somebody going and uniting all 100,000 different people under so many different clans, literally different species. I mean we're talking about giants and people and cannibals and all these different things. Here's a guy that doesn't belong there, who was born south of the wall, who goes up and in a matter of years has united all of them under his rule. And then in the books, we see him die in the TV shows. He's not even dead yet, right? He's still pulling some levers. We think that he might have written something called the Pink Letter, if you know what that is in the book. He's still out there doing incredible stuff. S-tier for my man, Mance. S-tier for the three self-made people that I think are really the most incredible power people. And I'm sure there are some people I left out. I should say I didn't know where to put Sansa in because she in the books right now is still very much in a learning stage. We get the impression that she's about to ascend but I think it wasn't well executed in how the show depicted it. We're told repeatedly how brilliant her plans are. I didn't really see a ton of her brilliant plans in the show so I didn't know where to rank her. I suspect by the end, she's going to be A-tier-ish and a serious player. But if there's someone that you think I left out, let me know. The last one that deserves it are at the top, triple S-tier, all the Direwolves, probably Ghost, King, Lost in the Air, fought in the Battle of the Dead, didn't even get pet afterwards but luckily, he had that one scene with Jon at the end. So, hope that you guys have enjoyed this tier list. This is obviously just for fun. If you liked it and you want me to do other TV shows or other groups of characters, maybe even real people, let me know in the comments below.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"For many men, Don Draper is the epitome of confidence. You're happy with your agency? You're not happy with anything. You don't want most of it. You want all of it and I won't stop until you get all of it. But what most people don't realize is that confidence actually comes in two flavors — there's the external confidence that you project which can make closing deals, making friends, or seducing happen more naturally but there's also the internal confidence you feel — how comfortable you are in any given situation. So in this video, we're going to be analyzing what Don can teach us about both levels of confidence and how mastering each level can take you from being nervous to completely confident in any situation. Now, at the most basic level, we have the way that Don carries himself. Obviously, he's a good-looking guy, he's got nice suits but it's his relaxed body language that is the most interesting. For instance, he almost always sits asymmetrically and spreads himself out comfortably which will actually cause you to relax if you do this yourself. Don also moves freely around most environments which signals a sense of comfort and ownership wherever he is. He acts like the boss everywhere. Now, you don't need to take it this far but simply having your feet at least shoulder-width apart when you're standing or leaning with your arm draped over a chair in a way that doesn't prevent someone else from sitting there goes a long way towards projecting confidence. Additionally, you'll see Don subconsciously signal that others need to work for his attention. He leans back in his chair even when he's in a position where you'd think he'd want to win someone over like with clients. This flips the dynamic and makes them work harder to win him over. I've been in the winter. It's quite a shock coming back. Well put but that could be any vacation. This was very, very different. Don creates a similar effect with his eye contact. In the beginning of many interactions, he's aloof making limited eye contact almost disinterested in what is being said. You're going to ply me with drinks and convince me what a terrible mistake I'm making. That is quite a drink. If you're sitting opposite him, this will make you want to try to win his attention. It feels good to get the person who isn't paying attention to you to do so. And when the other person has done that, Don gives his full piercing eye contact on special occasions like when he's making a point. What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons. Or nailing a pitch like he does on this campaign for lipstick. She wants to tell the world he's mine. He belongs to me, not you. She marks her man with her lips. Or seducing you like he does all the time in the show. My name is Don. The biggest thing to take into your own life from Don's variable eye contact is not that you need to ignore people to be cool but that when you are making your key points that you want paid attention to, hone in. Those narrow piercing eyes keep people captivated and they show confidence in the words that you're speaking while emphasizing your most important points. Now, you can do everything that you've talked about up until now fairly easily but a much more difficult element of body language to master is what you don't do. And if you pay attention to Don, you'll notice that he doesn't fidget and that takes us to the next deeper layer of confidence which is non-reactivity. This is something we actually talked about in our video with James Bond. This is much harder to fake because our emotions often get the best of us in these high-stress situations and this is one area where lacking in confidence can really be a detriment. You overreact to your own mistakes and end up making things worse but when you can remain non-reactive, it shows that you're not pressured by what's happening around you and that makes you come across as more powerful. For instance, watch how Don reacts when two men hit on his wife in Rome and how he calmly role-plays that he doesn't even know her. Contrast that with their insecure overreactions to him. May I join you? Yankee, hey, go home. Are they making fun of me? A little bit. I'm only in Rome for one night. The sense of comfort and power that Don conveyed simply by not reacting is surely part of what drew Betty to him in the first place. This same level of low reactivity is especially important if you're a leader in times of crisis. Now, feeling your feelings is important but left unchecked, they can get in the way of pulling together to get out of a serious issue. Keeping emotional expression in check actually inspires resolve in others. In addition, simply remaining silent when things are going wrong buys you valuable time to think without exposing you as someone who is totally confused and lost. Don is so good under pressure not because he's just fast on his feet — that's actually an illusion. It's because he slows down enough to think calmly and react in the best way possible. Watch how he responds when a client doesn't like his pitch and I'm gonna have to speed it up a bit because he gives himself a full 20 seconds to think. Gentlemen, before you leave, can I just say something? As a general rule, we are more demanding of fast responses from ourselves than we are from others. People give themselves only 30% as much time to respond as they would give someone else which is why so many of us find it hard to pause when doing a public speech even though we know it's a powerful tool. So when you are in a stressful situation and it feels like you need to do something right now, pause. You're almost always better served from a presentation perspective and a decision-making perspective to take a deep breath and slow down otherwise, you're gonna look frantic and out of control. Now, the next sign of a more deeply internalized confidence is not trying to convince other people and that might sound odd because when you think of Don Draper, you might think of the salesman who is all about persuasion but being persuasive generally is very, very different from trying to convince any specific person. So paradoxically, Don makes many of his sales by not badgering clients and, instead, framing himself as an equal partner in a negotiation. He's screening them as much as they are screening him. Call it a day. Gentlemen, thank you for your time. Is that all? You're a non-believer. Why should we waste time on Kabuki? Sit down. No. Not until I know I'm not wasting my time. Now, this is effective because one of the ways that we determine if we want to associate with anyone is by how much they seem to want and need us. We, of course, like people who are interested in us but not too much. Much better is to share your interest whether it's with a date or a client but to walk away if it's not reciprocated. Now, one caveat here is that if you walk away in an emotional huff, you're not signaling confidence or power. You're signaling petulance and that makes other people just glad to be rid of you. Now, Don is guilty of this from time to time when people don't like his ads. Hope you enjoyed looking in the window. Give me a minute. Out. Get out. Don, excuse me? Get your things and get out of my office now. Resist the urge to yell or to tell a date or a client how sorry that they're gonna be for blowing the opportunity and instead, step into the mindset that says, well, looks like we're not a match. I wish you the best. Now, this finally takes us to the deepest layer of confidence and that is the belief that no matter what, you will be okay. When you've internalized this, confidence comes easy. Now, it all sounds nice but how do you develop this belief so that you feel it in any situation? One of the fastest ways to build any belief is to live it. So you show yourself that you're gonna be okay by doing exactly the things that you think you wouldn't be okay if you did and you don't have to jump off of buildings. In this case, I mean social things. So this is what Don does in the final seasons and I'm gonna have to quickly catch you up on the plot of Mad Men for the next clips to make sense. For those of you who don't know, Don's real name is Dick Whitman. He stole his lieutenant's identity when he was in the Korean War in order to escape his old life and get out of the war and he's lived with that fake name and even somewhat of a fake persona ever since. He displays the outer veneer of stoicism and confidence while behind closed doors, his family and even sometimes his career and emotions are crumbling. But in the final seasons of Mad Men, Don tells the truth at great personal cost. First, he tells Hershey's, his client, the truth about his orphaned childhood which loses him the account and gets himself fired. I was an orphan. I grew up in Pennsylvania. In a whorehouse. Do you want to advertise that? If I had my way, you would never advertise. Later, he confesses his moral failings to Peggy while at a retreat in California. I broke all my vows. I scandalized my child. I took another man's name. And finally, after he's been honest out loud, he has the courage to reveal the emotions that made him abandon his old life and it's all set into motion where a man at the retreat confesses to feeling unseen and unlovable. I had a dream I was on a shelf in the refrigerator. Someone closes the door and the light goes off and I know everybody's out there eating and then they open the door and you see them smiling and they're happy to see you but maybe they don't look right at you and maybe they don't pick you. Then the door closes again, the light goes off. Don is sitting there shell-shocked from his conversation with Peggy but as he listens, he goes from completely ignoring him to totally understanding where he's coming from. Despite the validation from business success and affairs with many beautiful women, Don still feels unlovable. And when he finally recognizes that same feeling of being unseen and unlovable, he can authentically connect with this man. ...is the deepest layer of confidence. It's not about always looking cool or always saying the right thing and it's not even about getting other people to respond to you in a favorable way. It's living your life at least socially like you will be okay no matter what and that means that you can tell the truth even if it loses you a client. You can tell the truth even if it makes you feel weak because when you live the truth believing that you're gonna be okay no matter what, you won't stay feeling weak for long. Instead, you'll stop feeling like you always need to say the right thing and you'll stop worrying that someone else might reject you because you know that you will never reject yourself. And when you combine this deep internal confidence with the ability to project external confidence, every interaction becomes easier and more fun and you may begin to even look forward to the situations that previously stressed you out. Now, if you're interested in the fastest way that I know to build both deep confidence and that external showing confidence, I put together a video program to fast-track you to the point where you feel centered in any social situation so you don't feel like you're hesitating or grasping for what to say to make an interaction go amazingly. This is our flagship program called Charisma University. It's a six-week program and every day, you will get a step-by-step action guide to make confidence your default mode of being and it focuses both on the presentation aspect as well as that inner game aspect which is nice because it takes the guesswork out of everything. You just follow the guide and you get the results. So if you want to fast-track to more confidence, more charisma, you can learn more about the course with the button on the screen or the link in the description. We have had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it so I hope that you decide to join if this is an area of your life that you are looking to improve. Either way, you are okay and you will be okay. I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 694}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Tommy Shelby was our most requested video ever, so today we're doing a breakdown that's long overdue—his frenemy, Alfie Solomons. That's lovely, isn't it? That's lovely. While you don't want to be like Alfie in every way, there are four habits you can learn from him to instantly command more respect from the people around you. And even though Peaky Blinders is a scripted TV show, all the psychology covered in today's video will apply to your actual life. Let's start with a quick scene from season three. If you haven't seen it, Alfie's just sold Tommy a list of buyers for a stolen item. Notice how Alfie reacts when Tommy freaks out. Alfie demonstrates one of the quickest ways you can command respect—by being calm in situations where most people would show fear. For a quick comparison, watch how Alfie and his right-hand man each react after Tommy claims he's planted a grenade in their rum shop. Notice how their different reactions impact your impression of them. Hundred to one, you're f***ing lying, mate. Holly, what are you saying? Jesus Christ, Alfie! He tied his f***ing lace! I saw him! Look, he planted a grenade. I know he did. Alfie, it's Tommy f***ing Shelby! You're behaving like a f***ing child. Definitely don't model Alfie's violent tendencies. Like I said, we don't want to be like Alfie in every way. But being calm in high-pressure situations is a quick way to command respect in your own life. Specifically during an argument, a good rule of thumb for keeping your cool is to purposefully wait two to three seconds before responding. This will help you look poised and give you time to react calmly. Watch Alfie do it here. You f***ing invite a tribe of savages into the city and just f***ing unlock the f***ing gates! I'm sorry, what are you saying, mate? As a general rule, we are more demanding of fast responses from ourselves than we are from others. People tend to give themselves only 30% as much time to respond as they would give someone else. So when you are in a stressful situation and it feels like you need to do something right now, pause. Otherwise, you risk looking frantic and out of control. Along with this calm demeanor, there's another habit in that scene that helps Alfie appear confident, which brings us to our second key habit — Alfie holds eye contact, especially during conflict. Here's another example. You people, you hunted my mom with dogs. A common mistake some people make when watching scenes like this is thinking that you should hold eye contact all the time. But that's not the takeaway. If you hold and they hold, it can create even more tension. So the trick is to be purposeful with your eye contact during conflict. Break by looking down if your number one goal is to de-escalate. Hold if your number one goal is to show you aren't intimidated. And if you want to de-escalate without signaling fear or discomfort, then hold eye contact for 3-5 seconds and then break to the side instead of down. As an example, watch how Alfie responds after Arthur Shelby basically says, yes, I found religion, but I will still kill you. It's a perfect example of how to de-escalate without ceding power. I'm Old Testament. F**k yeah, look at that. Congratulations, Tommy. You now have the finished article. See that man, he will murder and maim for you with God on his side. There's another trick you can learn from Alfie to command more respect with just your eyes. Alfie doesn't let other people dictate where his attention goes. A great example of this is when he meets Luca Ciangrada, an Italian mob boss with more money and more power than Alfie. Luca goes in expecting Alfie to defer to him but Alfie is doing an exercise to better understand the blind and refuses to even open his eyes. What time is it? 29 minutes past 8. Right. Well, then I have another minute to go, actually, but you can begin. We saw the same principle in the previous scene where Arthur was staring at Alfie murderously and he chooses instead to speak to Tommy. This behavior has the effect of making people crave your attention because you are being selective with it. For instance, I have a friend who gives his undivided attention to whoever he's speaking to. If you try to interrupt, he won't turn to you until the person he was originally speaking with has finished what they're saying. It can feel a bit annoying in the moment when you're being ignored but it feels great as the person that he's speaking with. And for both people, it makes you value his attention because once you have it, you have it fully and if you lose it, you know you can't just demand it back. Now, body language isn't the only way to show confidence. For another option, let's go back to that opening scene where Tommy's deciding whether or not to kill Alfie for betraying him. Alfie chooses here to be honest even when it goes against his best interests which immediately commands respect. It's not that he wants to die. It's that he doesn't want to be spared for what he considers the wrong reasons. Now, in your own life, you're hopefully never in a situation where your life is at risk but there's still a concrete lesson you can learn here for social situation. Don't apologize just to avoid conflict. That's not to say don't ever apologize. If you've done something wrong, it's important to acknowledge it. But if you aren't sorry, don't say you are. This is a very common mistake people make especially in dating and it may avoid a fight in the moment but it sets you up to get walked on later in the relationship. The ability to be honest even when it goes against your best interests screams self-confidence. You're basically saying, whatever the consequences of my honesty, I know I'll be okay. Of course, the goal here isn't to fake that you're okay while you're freaking out on the inside. It's to cultivate a genuinely strong deep internal confidence. Once you do that, you'll naturally command respect in situations where most people would panic or get nervous. The tips in this video should instantly help you project confidence but building that strong internal confidence does take a bit more time. If you want the fastest way I know of to build that unshakable confidence, check out our program Charisma University. It's a 30-day step-by-step blueprint for building more confidence and charisma. Within just a few weeks of joining, we've had members transform their social and professional lives, getting more friends, more dates, new jobs, and promotions. Rather than tell you about the program myself, let's look at a few things that past CU members have written in. This first one comes from a guy who transformed his confidence. He says, Taking this course has been one of the most impactful decisions of my life. I can't recommend it enough. This next one is from a woman who works as a clinical psychologist. She says, And this last one is from a guy who joined after a breakup. He says, I feel liberated. Thank you for creating this course. If you want to join but you're not sure if it's right for you, you should know it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. That means you can get all of your money back for any reason at all. It's 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because we want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting massive value from the course. If you want to learn more, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Harvey Specter isn't exactly the perfect man. He can be rude, emotionally stunted, and sarcastic. Who doesn't like me? But even though he is flawed and, of course, fictional, his portrayal can teach you quite a bit about confidence and power in the real world. So in this video, you're going to learn concrete steps and deeper mindsets for conveying a deep sense of confidence and power. Now, a ton of this has to do with frames so I'm going to give a quick crash course. Frames are the unspoken context that dictates the rules of any interaction and you can analyze interactions as two people introducing and accepting or rejecting one another's frames. The more powerful, confident person usually wins out. That's why you're more likely to enthusiastically answer, tell me about yourself at an interview than at a party. You're going to acquiesce to the interviewer's frame because they have power that a random party goer doesn't. Whoever controls the frame has power. Anyways, the first thing to note is how Harvey's body language and tone are often in service of establishing the fact that he controls the frame and, therefore, is the more powerful person in an interaction. For instance, Harvey often surprises people by entering big and brash like the corporate lawyer that he is and he establishes the frame that the other person will react to his emotional state. Jessica threatened me. I don't care. Anyone comes at you with any threat at all, you come to me. I don't give a s*** if it's the Queen of England. You come to me, you tell me, you tell me everything. That's what loyalty is. But you'll often see Harvey respond much more slow and subdued when somebody directs him to do something. He takes his time, sub-communicating that he doesn't need to jump just because they say so. They might be saying, go quickly, he responds by going slowly, a subtle indicator of power. That's a Barbary legal handbook right there, right? Open it up. Read me something. Anything. All right, you know what, Harvey? Just get out. Get out. Similarly, other people will come at Harvey aggressively and rather than respond defensively, he strolls nonchalantly past them so that he can sit comfortably not reacting to their emotional state. First of all, Gerald, if you think anyone's gonna touch this deal after your bad faith, you're mistaken. Second... And when Harvey is in conflict with people who are losing control, he often stays cool, calm, and collected. Again, they go angry, he responds by not rising to it. How dare you walk in here and accuse me with these things? You are my lawyer. No, Bert. I'm the lawyer for Morello Asset Management. As far as the law is concerned, Dean Morello is my client, not you. What's important is not the particular frame of an interaction. That's always going to be changing. What's important is that Harvey is always the one setting the frame and you see the same ability to dictate the frame, in this case, that his status is superior to the other person's when he exits a conversation. He doesn't need to outright say it but he signals that he's in control by exiting without announcing it or asking for permission and it leaves the clear message that he is the boss. Everyone else is lucky to have some of his attention. Because right now, I got some things to take care of. Convince me why I should go with you in the first place. Okay, we're done. Don't let the door hit you on the way out. To be clear, I'm not recommending you do this. Broadcasting that you're in control all the time is not a good way to be or to be well-liked but it certainly does contribute to the sense of awe that people have when they encounter Harvey. Additionally, Harvey frames himself as nearly omnipotent by dictating not what he'd like to happen in a situation or what he hopes will happen but how things are certainly going to unfold. Listen to his language here. Here's what's going to happen. You're going to give me back my promotion and that's the last we're going to talk about this. The key to actually making this believable comes from Harvey's tonality. When we're nervous or we just want to make things sound like more of an invitation, we will add an upward inflection to a statement. Commands and certainties are often spoken with downward inflections like this. Now, this is the difference between saying, for instance, come over my house at 7 and come over my house at 7. And when you tell people what's going to happen, you typically want to do it with a downward inflection as Harvey does. Everybody, give me and Faye a minute alone. It's okay, Louis. I got it. Now, rather than focus on all of this at a concrete level, simply keep in mind that the person who controls the frame of a conversation will come across as more powerful and confident. And for the purposes of charisma, setting a higher energy frame is best in entrances and greetings whereas Harvey's slower, less reactive frame is more powerful in moments of conflict. This brings us to the next main point. Powerful, confident people respond to other people's insults not by challenging the content of their insult but by attacking the frame. Challenging the content would imply that you've accepted their frame and need to defend yourself. Shifting the framing is a verbal way of taking back control and it's the heart of quick wit. Check out a few examples here. Fantastic wine. Almost enough to make up for the mediocre company. Don't be too hard on yourself. You're not mediocre. See, that's funny because you're talking about me. So what is this, a new cologne or just a hint of jealousy? I'm surprised you don't recognize your wife's perfume. I know. You're not married. Still funny. Now, you don't need to be cutting or sarcastic like Harvey was in the last clip. The simple act of not being so concerned with literally defending yourself when someone makes a joke about you will take you a long way. In fact, the less that you focus on literally defending yourself, the better your banter will become. A key here, though, if you're going to engage in banter is not to make it critical to win every exchange. Powerful people can mess around and they don't need to win every time. So when someone does jokingly get one-up on Harvey, he can confidently play along further solidifying his confidence and power. We have breakfast at Nougatine and an excursion to Hermes that may or may not involve a new handbag. You've been needing a new handbag. You can never have too many handbags. You're a son of a bitch. It's exactly what I thought of myself when I came up with the idea. Harvey's next keyframe dictates how he interacts with clients and it's the belief that he is not there to impress or to supplicate to them. The unspoken frame is that they are lucky to be working with him. So when they begin to disrupt this framing, treating him as an inferior that they can berate, he quickly asserts that he has the power to leave them. You see it how you want to see it. But if you can't figure out a way to make Jonathan stay, you'll be the one who's gone. Tony, I'm gonna fix this but let's get one thing clear. I'm not like the other lawyers you've burned through. So the next time you go stomping around like a four-year-old throwing tantrums with me, I'll be the one getting rid of you. Again, rather than responding to the content of what they're saying by defending himself, he responds to the framing that he ought to be working for their approval in the first place. Now, you don't have to flat-out tell clients that you don't need them but if you're any kind of sales role or client-facing role, you will perform much better if you shift your mindset from I'm selling this person or I work for this person to this person needs me to partner with them. That means that you'll push back when needed, you'll give better advice and sub-communicate a powerful position that they're more likely to want to associate with. Now, another reinforcer of this partner frame is that rather than work for the praise of his clients, Harvey allows them to earn his favor complimenting them when they've impressed him. I don't take meetings. I set them. And my respect isn't demanded — it's earned. That's only two things. What's C? C is for people who show me they know A and B. Well, since we're quoting Jerry Maguire, all I want is for you to show me the money. You just took step number one towards earning my respect. It feels good for the client because they're receiving a compliment but it also reinforces the idea that Harvey is screening them. When people feel they've been accepted to something exclusive, it makes them value it much more than if they were simply sold into that thing. That's why people celebrate college admissions letters even though they essentially just received the biggest bill of their lives. Now, you can use this principle without being conniving in your own life. All it requires is that you pay attention to the moment that you think, You know what? I like this person. It could be something as simple as saying during a greeting, I love your enthusiasm. It's always a bummer when people are flat during interactions. That little statement positions you both as friendly and discerning in terms of who you choose to spend time with. Now, this takes us to the fourth way that Harvey conveys power — again, to do with frames — and it's that he is an expert at framing one's options in any particular scenario. When it comes to his opponents, he frames their options in a very limited way. He says, here's your choices — things that you don't want to do and the thing that I want you to do. It makes people feel like he has total control over the situation. We move forward with the suit, lose-lose. We can give you your money back plus the $500,000 or you and I can play poker for it. But the truth is Harvey doesn't have total control. He's just controlling the menu which is to say that he controls the options that are readily available in anyone's mind and the person who controls the menu controls the outcome. Harvey is savvy enough to never let people do this to him though. He recognizes that there is always another option that suits him better than what the menu might say. And what are your choices if someone puts a gun to your head? What are you talking about? You do what they say or they shoot you. Wrong. You take the gun or you pull out a bigger one or you call their bluff or you do any one of 146 other things. If you can't think for yourself, maybe you aren't cut out for this. The video that we did on Tyrion Lannister goes deeper into this idea as it is a staple of Tyrion's character and I'll link to that in the description if you want to check it out. But for now, we have arrived at the fundamental mindset that makes Harvey so powerful and it's that he creates options for himself. In any negotiation, the person who has a better second option is going to win. They can afford to care less and Harvey knows that he can always get another client or another job or find another way if someone closes one path to him. He has power because he doesn't need anyone specific to do anything specific for him. He can get what he wants and needs from a variety of sources. This is a mindset that can improve your life dramatically in a ton of areas. In dating, create options — that doesn't mean that you need to date all the time. It means that you simply become the type of person who knows that they're capable of finding someone else that they love spending time with and that might mean that you work on the general social skills that you're finding on our channel. In your career, create options — you are far more likely to ask for and get a raise when you've been developing your skills in your free time and know that you could get another job if things didn't work out. In short, power and confidence go up when you know that you have options. If you want to get better at creating more options in your life, you're already on the right path because whether you're focused on your career, your dating life, or your friendships, charisma is a skill that will unlock incredible new options for you and make everything in life easier. And if you want to fast-track your charisma growth with a step-by-step program that's guaranteed to give you more charisma and confidence in 30 days, I definitely recommend checking out our course, Charisma University. In just six weeks, it teaches you everything from how to make an amazing first impression through to commanding respect and being a leader everywhere you go. And every day, you get a step-by-step action guide to make powerful confidence your default mode of being which is nice because it takes the guesswork out of having to do all this improvement.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"There are five personality types that people obsess over, and if you discover which one best matches your unique individual personality, you will be able to tap into the most confident and charismatic version of yourself. But you must be aware that each type comes with a common pitfall that can wind up pushing people away. So in this video, you're going to find out which type best suits you and learn exactly what pitfalls you need to avoid. The first type is the funny type. If this is you, people like you because you make them laugh. I like my doughnuts so fat their holes are closed. But of course, funny types don't always have to be positive and bubbly. Sometimes their jokes are sarcastic. You don't have a license? No. Okay. You can't drink and drive, so what's the point? And sometimes funny types even roast people. You should not be watching me before you go to bed. Well, that's not a good image. My wife likes it because it acts as a sort of contraceptive. She knows I'm not going to... Now, while this playful teasing can make people like you, you need to be careful not to make people the butt of your jokes too often, which will alienate them over time. For example, watch Russell Brand pick on Emily Blunt in this next clip. To a funny type, this might seem like just a lighthearted joke, but Emily's defensiveness later suggests that it might have dug a bit too deep. So if you are a funny type and you want to do it without making people dislike you, the main thing to focus on is cracking jokes where the punchline builds up the other person, like this. So whether it's a celebrity or not, it's about the girl, not her occupation. If you make sure that half or more of your jokes are building other people up, you can use teasing and sarcasm without worrying that you're hurting your friendships. And that brings us to the second type, the energetic type. This type is huge on enthusiasm. Think of anyone who walks into a room and is overwhelmingly positive, optimistic, and body language. If this is you, you're probably breaking social norms without even realizing it, giving big hugs, slapping high fives, in situations where most people would quietly introduce themselves and just sit down. You can make an entire room happier just by being there, and it's likely that people call you funny, but it might not be because of the wit that the funny type has. Your mannerisms, like the sound effects and hand gestures that you make when you're telling a story are a huge part of your particular charm. And again, unlike the funny type, you might tend towards physical reenactment and impressions over witty highbrow humor. But of course, there are some pitfalls with this type. First, people might think that you lack depth and find it hard to connect with you. And second, you can come across as obnoxious if you're just being loud and hugging all the spotlight. So if you are an energetic type, that means you need to add elements of this next type to make people really enjoy you over a long period of time. And that type is the empathetic type. If this is you, you value connection above all. You get people to open up and be vulnerable around you because you are often open and vulnerable yourself. Lex Friedman exemplifies this style. If this is you, you may be more introverted and soft-spoken than the other types, but when people are around you, your eye contact, deep questions, and attentive listening make them feel comfortable and deeply accepted. You can probably even reflect people's own feelings back to them in a way that makes them feel very understood. Oprah was a master of this. Now, connection types are great one-on-one. You probably do amazing in those situations. The pitfall that you're aware of is that it's very easy for people to overlook you in larger social settings, so you're going to want to develop some habits from the next closest charisma types, the one that's closest to your personality, so that you really shine in those larger groups. Moving on to the fourth type, which is almost the opposite of the connection type, is the self-assured type. If this is you, you are extremely high in conviction. People want to follow your lead because you are so certain of what you're saying. Almost everyone is uncertain of themselves, their values, and the future, so they gravitate towards those people who seem to know exactly who they are, what they want, and what is going to happen. The pitfall of this type is that you can often miss opportunities for growth. You are so certain that things are going to go the way that you've imagined that you might overlook your own weaknesses and minimize the competition. So while you look like a phenom when everything is going well, then reality strikes and nothing is certain and it can come back to smack you in the face. This is why, if you lean towards the conviction type, it is best to rest that conviction not on guaranteeing specific outcomes, but on guaranteeing your continued effort. And that brings us to the last type, the authentic type. If this is you, honesty, being real, that's what's paramount. And what's interesting is that people might not like you right away. You might pursue a conflict that most people would sweep under the rug or share your honest opinion when you know the other person disagrees, like Joe Rogan does here with a political commentator opposed to gay marriage. Or you might just go off the reservation with a weird sense of humor that the other person maybe doesn't get, but you don't notice. If this is you, the good news is that people don't like you because every single moment is wonderful, but because they respect your honesty. You're not trying to get people to like you, and that lets people relax in your presence. They can sense that you aren't looking for validation from them, so they can take a deep breath. The pitfall here is that if you are just authentic and you throw everything else out, you might dominate the conversation by talking about things that you care about that nobody else does. So if this is you, you of course want to put authenticity first, but social graces need to be a close second. One thing that will help there is purposely pausing in conversations to create space for the other person to re-opt into the topic that you may be passionately pursuing. Now of course, the point of identifying these types is not to say that one is better than any other. The point is to give yourself permission to lean in the direction of the type that best matches who you are, not to copy someone else. When you do that, your confidence will naturally radiate out from you and blow people away because it is specific to you. And if you feel like you now know your style and want to make the most of it, you may want to join our course, Charisma University. This is our step-by-step, 30-day program that tells you exactly what to do every day to make charisma an unthinking habit, and in the first five days, you're going to nail down the charisma type that you most want to lean into with specific, advanced guidance to get the most out of your charisma style. There are just a few things that some of the past members have said, and this first comment came from just one week into the program. My two areas of focus are connection and authenticity. While going through the first impressions module, I've been able to get into conversation with people that I never would have before. The lesson on asking questions to draw out values is gold. Thanks to everyone who developed the course, it has already been life-changing and I can't wait to see what is next. Another member wrote in, I wasn't truly confident. I was constantly seeking validation and cared too much about other people's opinions. But now my life has improved tremendously because of Charisma University. I find it way easier to connect with people, to have great interactions, and to be happy even if things don't go the way I want them to. Taking this course has been one of the most impactful decisions of my life. I cannot recommend it enough. And lastly, one member wrote, Before Charisma University, I sucked at having conversations and I had low confidence around people. I am way more confident now, having gone through the daily action guides, and I can see a big difference in the attention and respect that I get. It makes life so much more fun. I don't think it's an overstatement to say Charisma is literally a gateway to getting anything you want in life, so thank you for making Charisma University. Everything inside Charisma University is built in an order that is easy to digest and learn and it takes just 20 minutes a day.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"People love Tommy Shelby from Peaky Blinders. He's a quiet, introverted character and, at the same time, extremely charismatic. While you don't want to be like Tommy in every way, there are eight habits you can learn from him to instantly command more respect from the people around you. And even though Peaky Blinders is a scripted TV show, all the psychology covered in today's video will apply to your actual life. Also, this video has a few scenes from season six, but no spoilers. The first thing that you see from Tommy is that he has slow, relaxed movements. When he isn't physically fighting, he's almost never in a rush. For example, notice how slowly Tommy moves in this next clip and how it instantly gives you the sense that he's above feeling intimidated. When you move slowly and comfortably in a situation where most people would be stressed, it shows that you don't feel scared or pressured. Along with his slow movements, there's a second body language habit you saw that helps Tommy appear confident. Tommy is comfortable holding eye contact, even during conflict. We talked about this briefly in the Alfie video, the one mistake you could make after watching scenes like this is trying to hold eye contact all the time. But holding eye contact during conflict can actually escalate the tension if neither of you is willing to break. So the goal isn't to never break eye contact, it's just to know what your behavior signals to other people. Hold if you want to show you aren't intimidated. Look down if your priority is to de-escalate. And if you want to diffuse the situation without projecting fear or discomfort, you can hold eye contact for 3-5 seconds and then break to the side instead of down. At a high level, Tommy's ability to command respect in moments of conflict comes from the fact that he's not reactive to hostility. Notice how much confidence Tommy can project without even speaking. Being non-reactive shows you feel confident in your ability to handle whatever is happening. It's hard not to respect someone who keeps their cool in situations where most people would lose it. Here's another funny example of just how non-reactive Tommy can be. This is obviously an extreme example and hopefully none of us will ever have to deal with trying to keep cool with a gun to our head. But it's a good example of how Tommy's non-reactivity projects confidence under pressure. Of course, the goal here isn't to fake that you're okay while freaking out on the inside. It's to cultivate a genuine deep internal confidence. We'll talk more about how to do that at the end of this video. There is one more quick body language habit you should steal from Tommy if you want to command attention specifically in large groups. Be as big as your audience. Gale up your hand gestures when you're speaking to more people. It is you, my friends, who must suffer the cuts in wages and in welfare and in dignity. And you must not complain because that would be unpatriotic. Moving beyond body language, the next way you can command respect is by focusing on how you speak. The first thing you notice about Tommy when he speaks is that his word choice shows conviction. Specifically, when he talks about his plans for the future, he doesn't say, I hope to or I want to, but I will. Beyond word choice, you can show conviction with just your tone. Many people do the opposite, ending in upward inflection, making statements sound like questions. This gives the impression that you're unsure of yourself. As an example, compare Tommy's tone in this next clip to Gina's. So if you want to show conviction with just your tone, end your statements in a downward inflection. Similar to his slow, relaxed body language, Tommy also has a slow speaking cadence and uses pauses between words to hold attention. The pause is the moment when you're not speaking, but ironically, it's the moment you can pull people in. Tommy does this by pausing when you most want to hear what he has to say. You may worry that speaking slowly and pausing a lot will lead to people cutting you off. The way you can prevent this isn't by rushing to finish or giving up on your thought halfway through, but by continuing to speak in that same slow speaking cadence until you've at least finished your sentence. Watch this next clip as an example you can model. For context, that ticking in the background is a bomb. Now, there's one more important thing to cover when talking about why Tommy Shelby commands so much respect. He doesn't have to shout or raise his voice because either he knows what you desperately want and can give it to you, or he knows what you desperately fear and can prevent it. So his quiet words carry massive weight. As an example, let's go back to earlier in that chosen one scene when they first threaten Tommy. Tommy projects confidence because of everything we've spoken about so far in this video, but why is he able to be so calm and non-reactive under pressure? Because he knows he's not actually in danger. Watch why. We touched on this in our first Tommy video, and it's one of his defining features. He wields tremendous power over people using carrot-stick motivation. Now, obviously, we don't want to be threatening to murder children, so how on earth can you actually apply this to your own life? Well, let's say you want a raise or a promotion from work. A lot of people would just go in and say, hey boss, I've been working here a long time, I would really like a raise, can I have more money? Very focused on I, not very persuasive. How could instead you apply carrot-stick thinking? You could say, hey boss, I feel like I can add more value to the company and play at a higher level. What would you need to see from me in the next three months to promote me? Work with your boss to create a concrete list. Then, nail everything on that list. At the same time, go out and get other job offers. In three months, you can show all the value you've created for your boss. Carrot. And if they back out from the agreement, you can tell them that you want to stay, but you have other offers that pay more if they're unwilling to give you a raise. That's the stick. No murdering of children involved. Now, while that plan is extremely likely to work, most people don't have the confidence to execute it. You might think that building that kind of confidence will take you a long time. Or maybe you even think it's impossible for you, that you could never actually build deep internal confidence. But building confidence is way easier than you think. With the right game plan, you can become significantly more confident in just a few weeks. If you want the fastest way I know to take your confidence and charisma to the next level, you should check out our program, Charisma University. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. I've been interviewing for jobs recently, I went through the confidence practices right before, and I hit the interview out of the park. It allowed me to focus on the first impression and establish rapport right from the start. Charisma University has made a huge difference for me because it taught me the power of connecting with the person you are speaking with. This next one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career. He says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma, yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills, which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you have taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. And lastly, one member writes, Thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values and I know who I am. The program is literally guaranteed to change your life. That means you can take the entire course and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund from right inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We are in an epidemic of loneliness, and it's a real problem. Roughly half of adults report feeling socially disconnected, and science is showing loneliness is associated with greater risk of dementia, stroke, depression, anxiety, and even has a similar risk of premature death as smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day. On the flip side, you've probably heard that you are an average of the five people you spend the most time with. That means with rare exceptions, your happiness and success are heavily dependent on who your friends are. So in today's video, you'll learn how to improve in each of the four main phases for making incredible friendships. How to meet new people, how to turn those meetings into friendships, how to make those friendships world-class, and how to maintain those world-class friendships for decades. Okay, so step one, meeting new people. By far the most common way that people meet their close friends is proximity. Do you know all your neighbors and coworkers? It's very possible that an incredible friendship is already nearby, you just have to follow the advice in this video to create it. When there is someone you want to meet and you aren't sure what to say, try this simple conversation starter. Hey, I don't think I've met you yet. I'm Ben. Say it with a smile and energy and you'll be shocked at how easy it is to start a conversation that feels natural. Now let's say you've met your neighbors and coworkers and you don't think your next great friendship is there. Well, you've heard birds of a feather flock together, so join a flock. Look for a pre-selected group that shares your interests. So for instance, if you're interested in improving your charisma, you can join things like a beginner's improv class or Toastmasters. If you feel like you don't have time to start a new activity, then consider how the things you're already doing can be done more socially. If you work from home, join a coworking space. If you like athletics, join a gym that specifically fosters community, like CrossFit or Jiu-Jitsu. Replace a solo habit, like weightlifting, with a similar habit that automatically connects you with potential new friends. If you can't find a pre-existing group that excites you, you can also become a beacon. Create the group and host events yourself. You may think this is impossible if you don't already have a lot of friends, but that isn't the case. You can use public platforms to attract like-minded people to your event. So if you're in school, you can do this by starting a school-sponsored group. If you've graduated, you can do this by using something like meetup.com or a local forum like your city's subreddit. You'll automatically attract people who share whatever interest you're creating the group about, and those people will want to meet you because you're the host. Lastly, if making friends is a priority, say yes to invitations. You'd be surprised how many people say they want to make new friends, but then don't go when a friend invites them to something with new people. Okay, so now that you're meeting new people, how do you go from meeting to being friends? This is a two-step process. First, you have to make a good enough impression that they want to see you a second time, and then you have to figure out the logistics of actually hanging out again. We've made other videos on how to make a great impression, so instead of covering that again, I'll link to two videos at the end of this video if you want a refresher. That said, I do want to take a few seconds to go over a mindset that makes it way easier for you to connect with new people. No exaggeration, this mindset will help you with every goal you have in your life. Focus on the process, not the outcome. So in the context of making friends, don't make your goal in conversation to become friends with the person. That outcome focus can make you nervous and kill your charisma. Instead, make your focus in conversation to have fun and see if you two connect. If you do that enough times, you'll eventually end up making friends with the right people for you. If you're thinking to yourself, even if I met 50 new people, I'd be lucky to have one who wants to be my friend. Then you need to start by prioritizing your own self-improvement. Become someone who the people you want to be friends with will want to be friends with. Once you hit it off and it's clear you're both enjoying the conversation, you want to set up a second hangout in a way that feels natural. To do this, bait for shared interests. So for example, if someone asks why I live in Malibu, I could just say I love the warm weather. Or I can say, I love the warm weather, it lets me surf and golf year round. So many times that's led to someone saying they also like surfing or golfing, or that they've never surfed but have always wanted to try it. It creates a very natural way to make plans together. On the flip side, if you've met by joining a flock or becoming a beacon, you already know your shared interest. But you might find your friendship gets stuck in that one setting. So you see your friend at improv or the gym, but never outside of it. In this case, just ask them if they want to get food or a drink after whatever you're doing. It sounds obvious, but a true friendship is hard to grow in just one setting. Sometimes, purposely going to another venue is all it takes to go from acquaintance to starting a friendship. Now let's talk about making your friendships stronger. The obvious thing that helps is simply time together. The more fun memories you have, the better your friends will be. But beyond that, there are three ways you can strengthen your friendships. Any one of these is all it takes to become close friends. And with all three, you're very likely to be friends for life. Also, just a heads up for the rest of this video, I'm going to sprinkle in some clips of celebrity friendships as examples to highlight some of the points. The first thing that can deepen a friendship is a shared North Star. That's what took Ben Affleck and Matt Damon from simply being neighbors as kids to being lifelong best friends. A shared goal automatically creates a ton of deep conversations and a catalyst to spend time together. It also naturally creates opportunities to strengthen the friendship. For example, listen to Ben explain why he and Matt had a joint bank account at one point. The first step to chasing a dream together is learning what someone's big dreams are. People often ask their friends small questions. How's your day? How was work? What are you up to this weekend? You should also ask your friends big questions. What's a dream you have for your life? What's your ideal vision for your life in five to 10 years? Simply asking these questions will deepen your friendships. Another great way to see if you share a North Star is to send your friends whatever book or video inspired your big dreams. Some people won't look at it. Others won't like it like you did. But for a few, it'll inspire them just like it inspired you. And now you have a friend who shares your North Star and wants to pursue that dream vision with you. The next thing that can turn a friendship into a lifelong friendship is being a lifeline, offering support and help in a time of need. For an extreme example, listen to Matt Damon tell the story of getting attacked in high school by a student way bigger than him. So before I knew it, it was like I was on the ground, he was he was above me, and I was like this is gonna be bad. And it was right then that little five foot two Ben Affleck tackled this dude off of me, literally at the risk of his own life. It's been 30 years since that fight, but you can see the memory still means a lot to Matt. But I remember that was like a big moment going like this guy is like he will he will put himself in a really bad spot for me like this is a good friend. And if someone already likes you, and then they see you're willing to sacrifice for them or take a risk for them, it can create a powerful bond. Because there's never been a time that I called on him and asked him for his help, that he wasn't the first responder. But just know, whenever you call on me, I will come because you have been one of the greatest friends that I've made in 35 years. Now, not everyone you support and help will reciprocate, some will be selfish, and some will take you for granted, you should never give to someone expecting or demanding something in return. But if you're supportive and generous with your friends, it is very likely they will love you for it. And then based on their behavior, you can decide who you want to be close with and who you want to keep as an acquaintance or filter out of your life. Being a lifeline doesn't always require a huge sacrifice. When someone is having a hard time, sometimes all it takes is letting them know you love them and you're here for them. I now like see resilience as like a major quality in friendship, when your stock is down, if they're still wanting to hang out, that's like, and I know who those people are now, it's really fun. There was a few critical times, which are private, and I don't want to share but which were your support was so profoundly meaningful to me that I don't think I would have been able to be successful with that. Now in your ideal close friendships, you won't just have two people who help each other achieve their goals or support each other through tough times. You'll also have mutual vulnerability, two people who feel seen, accepted as you are, and loved without judgment. How can you create this? There's three pieces to this and they feed off each other. The first piece is a willingness to share honestly. Prioritize being honest over looking good. Often you'll have to go there first before the other person will follow you. So share yourself fully, including things that you're scared will make you look flawed. The second piece is a willingness to accept honesty in return. Friends won't always agree with each other, you have to be open to hearing the other person's honest truth. Long term, standing in the gap, no matter what, I'm here for you, gonna tell you the truth, even if you don't want to hear it. We can go to one another and the other person will give like very loving advice. I mean, you've left me messages before where you'll say, lady, I think it's you. I think you're wrong. Actually, you have to be honest. We're a safe space for each other. The third piece, which is crucial if you want complete authenticity from your friends, is a lack of judgment and an underlying sense of acceptance. Even if you think a friend is making a decision that's bad for them, give that feedback in a way that makes it clear your advice is for them, for their sake. But you're here for them no matter what. Even if they do make the mistake, you're trying to help them avoid. Now, if you think the person is doing something morally wrong, you shouldn't pretend you're okay with it. At that point, your advice may hurt the friendship, but if they're doing something you think is truly awful, that's probably for the best. After all, your goal isn't to have as many friends as possible. It's to have deep, meaningful friendships with the right people. Now for the last chapter in today's video, how to maintain your close friendships for decades. The first step to maintaining a decades-long friendship is getting good at constructive conflict. Most people have an avoidance strategy for conflict. Don't say anything, pretend there's no problem, don't make it a big deal. This works if it's something you're willing to put up with forever. After all, no friend will be perfect. But ask yourself, if this never changes for 10 years, how will you feel? Will you still want to be this person's friend, or will the small fight you're avoiding today become a huge source of negative feelings and ultimately ruin the friendship? If it's the latter, you're much better off learning the three steps of constructive conflict. First, set a loving container. Let them know that you want to talk to them because you value the friendship. You're not blaming them, they're not bad. You love them. That's why you want to talk to them. Lead with love and you'll be shocked how much better your conflicts go. Second, make the conflict about a specific behavior, not the person. It will look something like this. What you don't want to do is go beyond addressing a specific behavior and attack your friend's character or personality. The third step in constructive conflict is to speak in the two F's, facts and feelings. You want to avoid saying anything the other person will disagree with. That way, you don't derail the heart of the issue bickering about details. So for instance, you wouldn't say, you always leave trash everywhere, you don't respect me. Now they can disagree with you about always, everywhere, and the feelings you assign them. Instead, you want to say, when you leave trash on the table, it makes me feel frustrated. Using this framework, you can hopefully have a productive conversation and work through your occasional conflicts in a calm, constructive way. On the flip side, how do you make sure conflict is constructive if the other person has an issue with you? If someone comes to you complaining about you or even criticizing you, don't get defensive. Don't try to prove that they're wrong and you're right. Instead, make your primary focus to stay calm and listen. Often what people first want in conflict is simply to feel heard and understood. Once you've done that, you can go through the same constructive conflict steps. Let them know you value them and their friendship and speak in the two F's, facts and feelings. Ultimately, good friends do not have to agree on everything. They just need to feel understood, respected, and loved. Now, while it's completely normal to occasionally have disagreements or hurt feelings in a friendship, you do want to remember the 5 to 1 rule. This is famed psychologist John Gottman's magic ratio. For every negative interaction during conflict, a stable and happy relationship has five or more positive interactions. So try not to stack bad interactions, or one fight can snowball into ruining what could be a great friendship. Now one thing that underlies a lot of fighting amongst friends is jealousy. And it's very rarely the topic of the fight. Instead, your jealousy creates negative feelings in you which you don't want to acknowledge, so you pretend they aren't there. Then the jealousy builds up and you start to feel an unnamed anger in you towards the other person, which ends up coming out in overreactions to other things. A lot of fights can be avoided completely if you learn to replace jealousy with joy. Be genuinely happy for your friend's happiness. For example, Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider have been friends for 35 years. Listen to how they talk about each other's success. You can see Adam's happier to talk about Rob's success than his own. You see the same behavior with Rob, he immediately deflects from his own success to talk about Adam's first big break. These guys were complete unknowns at the same time on Saturday Night Live. They very easily could have viewed each other as competition, rooted against each other, even actively tried to sabotage each other. Instead, they rooted for each other and are still friends today. If jealousy is something you struggle with, you should check out our video on happiness from last month, which I'll link to in the description. When you're genuinely happy with your own life, it's much easier for you to be happy for your friends. The next key to maintaining a strong friendship for years is to expect and embrace change. People will grow and change. If you hope they'll stay exactly the same as they are, you are going to be disappointed. And if you try to keep them stagnant and hold them still as their old self, frozen in time, they'll start to distance themselves from you. Instead, encourage them to change in the ways they want to, and then see if the new things that excite them also excite you. For example, Ben Affleck has a new passion, one that has taken over the number one spot where acting used to be. He wants to make a film studio that gives equity to everyone involved in the film. When someone changes the North Star that you've shared with them for decades, it can be jarring, and it can hurt a friendship. But rather than Matt trying to keep Ben focused on acting, he decided to join Ben and create that studio with him. Now, this doesn't mean that you have to be involved in everything your friends do. It would have been just as good for Matt to be excited for Ben's vision and decide it wasn't for him. It's natural for friendships to ebb and flow, to be close and then less close, and then close again. Just don't demand that your friends or your friendships stay stagnant. And even with everything in this video, accept that some friendships will end. That's okay. Because friends aren't Pokemon, your goal isn't to have as many as possible, it's to have amazing friends who love you, support you, and enrich your life. Now, if your main goal in watching this video is to create some amazing new friendships, you might like our video program Charisma University. We designed it to be the fastest path to more friends, a better dating life, and more confidence every day. If you don't feel like you have dramatically more charisma and confidence by day 30 of the program, you can get all of your money back. Rather than tell you more about it myself, I'll read you a few things that past members have said. I had just moved to a new city for work after college. I always had a bit of trouble interacting with people outside of my hobbies and social circle, and it was even more difficult to connect with people while working from home. By sticking with Charisma University, I've had the confidence to make groups of new friends and land a promotion. CU has changed the way I see people and connect with others, and I am truly grateful for that. Another member wrote in, I am significantly more confident in all social situations. The connection I feel with strangers and close friends and family alike have increased dramatically. I transitioned from someone who never got asked to hang out regularly to multiple people texting me on a daily basis. I've grown so much because of this course, and I cannot thank you enough. And lastly, one member wrote, In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go.

Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video, and I hope it helps you start to build some amazing friendships.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 987}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"A small talk can be a drag but it's possible to turn those boring everyday conversations into meaningful ones where you learn about someone and really connect with them. That's why in this video, we're going to explore what you can learn from some of the best conversationalists of our time about moving from small talk to deep connections so you never have to worry about being boring. Our first point is to open people up by letting them know that you're really happy to be speaking with them. You can see Joe Rogan do this in his recent interview with Lex Fridman. I love being able to talk to you and pick your mind about like you're out there coding these fucking vehicles that are driving themselves. Artificial life on wheels. Letting people know that you're happy to be with them can take other forms as well. You can also effusively compliment their work and indicate that you'd like to see or hear more of it. You want me to keep going? Fuck you. Go ahead. I'm just kidding. You better do the whole song. Or you can just straight up tell people that you love them. Before we talk about anything beside my book, Sirius XM, I wanted to tell you how much I love you. Regardless of the exact form, when you let people know that you appreciate and want more of them, it makes them invest more of themselves in the interaction. Now, saying that you're happy to be interacting with someone may seem obvious but some of us do what Howard Stern admits that he did early in his career. In an attempt to garner respect, we act disinterested or unimpressed when talking to people. We restrain our excitement to not come across as beneath the other person. Howard Stern, for instance, purposely didn't read up on his guests to assert his superiority when he didn't know who they were. This is Sofia Vergara. Is she here? I believe she is. Hey, now. And why is she here? Do you know? Because she's hot. Yeah, she's hot. That's why. Because Gary came in and showed me a picture of her and I went, well, book her. I want to take a look. But why did she want to come? I have no idea. She must have a website or something. What else? What else do hot chicks have? Being super cool and aloof can sometimes inspire people to work for your approval but it won't help you move from small talk into something deeper. That's because people need to know that you'll give them the benefit of the doubt if they share something embarrassing or vulnerable and the cool aloof guy can't be expected to do that. More on that later but keeping with the initial part of this conversation, if you want to shift from small talk to connection, you need to purposely steer towards a deeper conversational context. We all know that small talk tends to be on content like the weather, news, work, sports, or politics. What's very cool is that just about any of these content topics can be moved to a deeper context with one simple question. What did it make you feel? Like I knew nothing. That was the most profound aspect. All of this stuff that you concentrate on every day is nonsense. Moving from the specifics of what happened to how that thing made someone feel immediately creates more opportunity for you to connect over the real stuff. Of course, you don't have to say this phrase verbatim. Instead, anything that moves conversation towards feelings, motivations, or values can work. Here's just one example. about, like, physical stuff. Like, you get angry and you get anxiety because, like, you let yourself get overweight. Like, how much does that fuck with you and how much would you give to not have that anymore? Now, to be fair, people still won't always be forthcoming with their feelings, motivations, or values which is why this third tool is very useful and it's called parroting. It's simply repeating back the last few words of what someone has just said. What I loved about them and what I was so fascinated by is they didn't think consequence. They just thought, hey, I'm doing this and then they would do it and then they just dealt with it. You had too much conscience. Too conservative. Conservative, yeah. Yeah, you thought things through and said, hey, this could end up being real trouble for me. These guys just dove in. You can use this in your own life early on in conversations when people are sharing what they're studying or doing for work. Repeating their title back to them or their major with curious interest can get them to elaborate on how they like what they're doing or why they chose it in the first place and now you successfully move towards feelings and motivations with just one little trick. Now, this takes us to the fourth point and this one is a bit more challenging for most people. You have to realize that when you do get people to open up, they may share something they're not totally proud of. In these instances, you need to avoid judging them. Instead, you can watch Howard actually be an advocate for the things that his guests are ashamed to have felt or done. For instance, Charlize Theron revealed that when she was young, a Hollywood producer came on to her in an uncomfortable way at a casting at his house. Though she would have loved to have told him off, she shut down emotionally and escaped quietly. Howard proactively helps her make sense of her reaction in this next clip. I'm not that kind of girl. Why did I not tell him to go fuck himself? It made me so angry. You know why? Because in the moment, if you're a decent human being, you can't believe what's happening to you and you feel like you should be polite. It's weird. And then afterwards you go, why am I so fucking polite? Exactly. Why am I such a good boy or good girl? Similarly, Howard preempts the jealousy that he assumes Lindsay Lohan must have felt about other actresses getting roles that she could have. When you see like Emma Stone, who's got like a similar look to you, or let's say Jessica Chastain, I can tell you've thought about this. Like when you see some of those movies, don't you sit there and go, I could fucking do those movies. Yes. Right? Yes. It's gotta be driving you nuts. We're more insecure, jealous, selfish, or fearful than we let on in conversation. We hide these parts of ourselves because we think it's necessary to being liked. But in order to connect deeply with someone, we need to take off the masks that we use to fit in. When this happens, you don't want to signal to the other person that they need to put the mask back on by saying things like, how could you do that? Or I would never. Instead, a better response is to pause and take a moment when someone becomes vulnerable to acknowledge their courage. Joe Rogan does this with a combat vet who talks in painful detail about his wartime injuries and what they've cost him physically and emotionally. Someone like you truly understands the consequences of war, like the physical consequences in a way that none of us will understand. You know, it's, it's very, not just, it's brave of you to talk about this, but it's also, it's so, so valuable, so valuable for everybody that, that hasn't served to understand what it really is. So thank you for that. So in your own life, before you jump to react or give advice in these kinds of situations, just acknowledge someone's bravery first. It goes a long way to fostering connection. Now, until now, everything we've covered has been about encouraging others to open up and connect with you. But if you're committed to having deeper interactions, you can't wait on other people to be courageous enough to share. You need to go there first. That means that you reveal vulnerabilities and unflattering truths even when you're not sure how they'll be received. Now, Howard is pretty special here. Over the years, he's spoken about so many of his personal issues on the radio, from his insecurity, to jealousy, to body image, including his shame at his smaller-than-average private parts. So when guests come on, they know that they're not the only ones opening themselves up to judgment from the audience since Howard will, out of nowhere, say something like this. I was at war with the world. I was a guy who was very angry, and I was angry if anybody had a listener or an audience that wasn't mine. When guests see Howard still standing and smiling after having so much of the world know his deepest insecurities and current struggles, they realize that they can open up too even if it's in front of a massive radio audience and it's something they haven't spoken about publicly like when Paul McCartney nonchalantly admitted who broke up the Beatles. Everyone has a theory. I know. Who broke it up? John. John did? Yeah. And he tried to pin it all on you. In your own life, the advice is simple yet can be very difficult to implement. It's that when you're in small talk and you're reminded of something embarrassing, don't filter. Share it without seeking any specific reaction from the audience. When it's obvious that you're being both honest and nonjudgmental about your own failings, you'll be shocked how quickly people match your candor. Obviously, this is easier said than done and Howard admits he can only implement many of these habits as a result of years of psychotherapy. Those gave him both the ability to be honest about his flaws and his appreciation for others like we spoke about in point three. I'm able to tell people what I think of them and how important they are without feeling ashamed. You know, it's just for so many years, I was afraid to feel attachment. Therapy can be great but, of course, it can take a long time and a lot of money so if the ability to be more open is something you're intrigued by, this final question is something to contemplate. Are you personally in touch with your own shadow? Those thoughts and feelings that are often rejected by society and our own egos. Have you truly confronted your anger, jealousy, judgmentalness, grief, and shame or have you stuffed them down to function as normally as possible? If you aren't in touch with everything that you are, the good and the unsavory, you will not connect deeply with people because you will always be wearing a mask. Techniques won't be enough to break through the small talk and it's likely to remain safe and boring. Not only that, you'll probably live with a subtle background anxiety that some disowned part of you might be discovered and you'll be cast out because of it. So ponder that question because it is massively important. Now, shadow work takes time but if you're looking for the fastest way that I know to boost your confidence and charisma, you can make massive gains with our flagship course, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program that's guaranteed to give you more confidence and charisma in just 30 days and it's structured with a daily action guide so that there's no guesswork when it comes to learning these habits. You just follow the guide and you get the results. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below but I figured the best way to let you know what this is all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written in via email or the course comments. The first one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career and he says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you've taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. Now, this next one comes from another person who started a new job saying, I wanted to let you know that I nailed those first days at work. Everything that I needed was right there at the right moment. The confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset and all with your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it could just not go wrong. And he finishes by saying, I just wanted to emphasize that what I did the previous days would not even have come to my mind if I had not discovered that charisma is a skill that can be learned thanks to your YouTube channel and university program. And this last one is a comment in the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their social and dating life and he says, Life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. And there are more success stories just like those in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all. And it's 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because I want to make sure that every single person truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course. Otherwise, you can just refund. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead. Click the link on the screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it. I hope that you decide to join if this is an area of your life that you're looking to improve and we look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 677}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"The character Ted Lasso is probably most well known for his wildly positive attitude. Biscuits with the boss time! And Higgins, hey! That's what he's a crowd. Hey, that's a crowd. I don't mind being smack dab in the middle of it, buddy. This is an awesome trait that we may cover in a future video, but in today's video, we're actually going to dive into leadership. While the show is pure fiction, Ted demonstrates techniques that real-life leaders like Steve Jobs, Larry Page, and Phil Jackson use to achieve incredible success. If you already naturally do these things, it's a sign that under the right circumstances, you could be a fantastic leader. Although, people may not give you quite as much loyalty as Ted gets in the show. Fellas, I could watch you do this jaunty North Korean military thing you do all day, but I need a favor. We'll die for you, coach! Okay, so let's get into the details of leading people, and more specifically, being someone that people want to follow. We'll show some clips with plot spoilers for Season 1, but we won't touch on Season 2. The first sign of a great leader is that they make everyone on the team feel like they matter. The show illustrates this well on Ted's very first day as a coach of his new team, when he meets the team's equipment manager. You see a small habit here, but it's an important one. And then later that day, we see this. This may seem like cliche TV stuff, but making people feel like they matter is a core part of being a leader. Author Simon Sinek lays it out well in this next clip. He's explaining the test of a good leader, according to a Marine Corps general he knows. The big mistake that most people make is to only tap into that genuine interest with their bosses or socially when they're talking to the most attractive person in a group. This is a common mistake, and it hurts you twice. Not only does it make the people you're blowing off feel like you don't care, it also makes the people you're trying to get to like you dislike you. Because it creates the feeling that you're a taker or a user. You're only giving them attention because you want something from them. So the best thing you can do as a good person and for your own self-interest is to make everyone feel like they matter without weighing what you think they'll be able to do for you. Ted lays it out well here. Now, while you may consider everyone a part of the team, that doesn't mean that everyone else automatically bought in or cares about your goals as a leader. In fact, most people probably care mostly about themselves. Ted's star player Jamie Tartt takes this to the extreme after he scores a goal. Check it out. Now, most people you're trying to lead won't be quite so obvious about it, but that's probably not too far off from some people's internal monologue. So what you want to do as a leader is align your goals. Instead of trying to get them to do something that's good for you, get them to do something that's good for them that also happens to be good for you. That's a sign of a natural leader. You don't try to persuade someone by talking about what you want or need. Simply put, speak in you, not I. As a side note, if you want to be a great leader, try to help your teammates achieve their goals even when it doesn't benefit you. The show demonstrates this very well. Ted wants Jamie to be more of a team player, but what Jamie wants is to be considered a great footballer. Listen to how Ted aligns their two goals and starts the process of making Jamie into both. I can honestly say you are the best athlete I have ever coached. You are truly great at everything you do out there. Except for one thing. If you just figure out some way to turn that me into us, the sky's the limit for you. This one speech doesn't magically transform Jamie overnight, but it's a start. At least until Rebecca sabotages Ted. Now that said, ultimately as a leader, your goal isn't just to get people to do what you tell them. A good leader creates lieutenants. They set up other people to become leaders. Again, let's turn to the show just to see an example. This clip is from when Ted was struggling to come up with new ideas for his offense. Ted thinks anyone is capable of good ideas, and so he solicits Nate to speak up. In this next clip, you'll see that he also forces Nate to actually bet on himself and his idea or have it thrown out. This may also seem like something that only works in a scripted TV show, but Phil Jackson, one of the best NBA coaches of all time, had a similar philosophy. Here are a few quotes of his from his book on leadership. This philosophy that anyone is capable of a great idea is also similar to Google's 20% project. Before Google's IPO, co-founder Larry Page codified the project by saying, And Google credits this with some of their biggest innovations. There's another aspect to creating lieutenants that the TV show does a good job of showing. Watch this next clip for an example of it, after Nate tries to write a pregame speech for Ted. A good leader lets people get the credit for what they've done. A common mistake people make when they're in charge of something for the first time is to try to hoard all the credit for themselves. But a good leader knows that if you feel proud of your work, you're going to work harder and do better. In that last example, Ted read the speech and actually made sure it was good, then he pushes Nate to give it himself. And it's a huge step in Nate's career. Ted's lack of ego also lets him actively solicit feedback and try to improve. This is one of the first things he does when he gets to his new team. If you haven't seen the show, this comes at a time when Ted knows he's not very well liked by his new team. To them, he's a random American coaching a sport he knows nothing about. But he still makes it anonymous because he actually wants to know how to improve his team. Even if it means wading through a ton of insulting comments to get there. Even if you're not currently a leader, this idea of soliciting feedback is one of the most powerful self-improvement exercises you can do. For example, you can do a blind spot circle. That's where you sit down with a group of close friends and ask them for honest feedback on what they think your blind spots are. This can be terrifying, it can lead to things you don't want to hear, and it can be an incredible catalyst for making positive change in your life. It works so well because if one person tells you constructive criticism, you probably have the urge to fight it or ignore it, disagree. But if five close friends all have the same feedback, it's hard not to at least consider it deeply. Just make sure to do this with a group of people who respect you and whose opinions you respect. Another sign of a natural leader is having the empathy to understand the people you lead. Simply put, if you can put yourself in their shoes, you'll know how to get the best out of them. If a leader isn't able to do this, they need to create a lieutenant who can do it for them. Here's a quick clip from the show to illustrate the point. Notice that Ted's assistant coach is quick to assume a struggling player just doesn't have talent. But Ted's empathy clues him in to that it might be something else. Different things motivate different people. Some need tough love, some need positive reinforcement, some need a mix of both. Some people need to be told exactly what to do, and others excel when given a goal and freedom to achieve it however they see fit. If you want to be a good leader, take the time to understand what motivates someone. If you can empathize with someone instead of demonizing them, you'll be better at aligning incentives, rewarding them, motivating them, and predicting what projects they'll succeed at. Once you do empower someone to succeed, the next habit of a good leader comes into play. Celebrate other people's wins. A theme you've probably already noticed is that if you want to be a good leader, you need to get people excited to follow you. Part of that process that many leaders ignore is making people feel appreciated. The show does a good job of highlighting the power of this, albeit with over-the-top enthusiasm because it is still a TV show. Ted loves to praise and reward people who are helpful. For instance, he celebrates Rebecca for helping to block a bad paparazzi photo. Bad leaders actually get their emotional reactions backwards. They react to good work with mild praise, and they save their big emotional reactions for when they're yelling at people because they screwed up. Now that said, as a leader, you do need to create an environment where bad actions have consequences, but the key is to do it in a matter-of-fact way and not become someone who takes joy in punishing other people. This next scene shows it well. For context, if you don't watch the show, Jamie is faking an injury here in protest of being moved to the bench, and he's basically refusing to practice unless he starts. Tell you what, do me a favor. When you get out there, set up the cones so the other reserves can do a little passing drill. I must say, it's quite nice seeing Jamie put in his place for once. Thrilling, even, isn't it? No, no, no, no, no. This is a no schadenfreude zone, all right? Nine schadenfreude. All right. Being able to strike that balance of celebrating when people do well and having consequences for if they do something bad is a sign of strong leadership. Now, these last two habits are signs of a natural leader that have less to do with other people and more to do with your own mindset. The first is a belief in a motivating vision. Steve Jobs has the best iconic story of this. When Steve was young and needed an all-star CEO for Apple, he was able to poach John Sculley from Pepsi. This was a huge win because, at the time, Pepsi was much larger and more well-regarded. So how was Steve Jobs able to convince John to quit and come to Apple? Listen to John describe what happened. And then he looked up at me and just stared at me with this stare that only Steve Jobs has. And he said, do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or do you want to come with me and change the world? By framing Pepsi as a company that just makes sugar water, Steve reframes his job offer. This isn't about money or prestige anymore. It's not about which company is bigger. It's about doing something that's meaningful. Motivating people towards a random goal they don't care about will be a constant battle against inaction. Because they don't care about what you're trying to achieve. You also heard there how John specifically mentioned Steve's eye contact. That's because it's not just about saying you're going to do something big. Anyone can do that. It's about sub-communicating with your non-verbals that you really believe it'll happen. In a word, it's conviction. Ted shows that belief in his team even after suffering a season-ending loss and demotion to a lower league. That said, don't deny reality. This is a major mistake some people make when first becoming a leader. They want to be optimistic and show they have faith in their team, so they pretend things are going better than they actually are. You cannot get where you want to go until you admit where you currently are. The show writers knew that even the eternal optimist Ted couldn't believably turn around a team without acknowledging that they're not in a good place and they need to shake things up. You can watch the scene here. If you're unwilling to admit where you're weak or what areas of your life aren't where you want them to be, then you'll never be able to put the work in to get better. This is something a lot of people struggle with, especially when it relates to things like leadership, confidence, and social skills. It's extremely common to tell yourself lies like, well, I didn't get that promotion because life's unfair. It's harder to admit, I didn't get it because I don't do great work, or I don't have the people skills to make my boss like me. Similarly, it's easy to go to a bar and tell your friends, no one here is attractive. It's harder to admit, yes, that person is attractive, but I'm scared to talk to them. Before you can improve, you need to be able to take an honest assessment of where you are and how near or far you actually are from where you want to be. Does that ring true or strike a nerve? Is there an area in your own life where you secretly wish you were doing better? Acknowledge it, accept it, even if you don't like it, and that will allow you to improve in that area. Now, depending on what that area is, you may like our 30-day program on charisma and confidence. Charisma and confidence aren't a magical cure-all for all your problems, although I wish I could say they are, but if you're someone that wishes you had more friends or stronger friendships, a better dating life, better relationships at work, a promotion, or the ability to crush an interview for a new job, those are goals that taking your charisma and confidence to the next level will help you achieve. If that's you, check out Charisma University. It's a step-by-step 30-day online program. It only takes 20 to 30 minutes a day, and it comes with a daily action guide that tells you exactly what to do each day to build unshakable confidence and build charismatic habits you start doing without even thinking about it. There's two main differences between Charisma University and our YouTube videos. The first is that sequential setup. There's no guesswork in terms of how to build your charisma. It's all laid out for you in the easiest way possible. The second is it's literally guaranteed to change your life. If you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a 100% refund just by clicking a button inside the program. As of now, we've had 8,000 people go through the course and get a ton out of it. I'd love for you to do the same. People write us about new promotions, new jobs, new friends, new confidence, even marriages that they say would never have happened without Charisma University. I had confidence in some areas, but not in others. Then, Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. It costs less than half the price of one course at my college, but it has had a far bigger impact on me than any traditional class I've enrolled in. Another member wrote in, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. In conversations, I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think and how I feel, even in bigger group settings. I feel much more happy all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman I've had a crush on for about a year and made a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep going back to it when I need a refresher on the daily action modules. And lastly, one member writes, Thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values and I know who I am.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"This video is about how to be happier for the rest of your life starting today. We're going to cover three common mindsets that lead to unhappiness. Most people don't even realize they have these mindsets or, if they do, they don't know how to stop them. We'll also discuss some lessons from stoicism so that you can feel more joy every day. The first common cause of unhappiness is unmet desire. To most people, this seems both obvious and unavoidable. Of course you get unhappy when things aren't the way you want them to be. There are things you want. More money, fame, a different job, a better body, a better romantic partner. Whatever your thing is, you think, I'll be happy when I get that. That four-word phrase, I'll be happy when, can make you miserable. Because when you do get what you want, you'll experience something called hedonic adaptation. You'll feel a very short-lived increase in happiness, followed by a quick reset right back to your old baseline. Even worse, now the bar is raised for what you have to get in order to experience the next little burst of happiness. Dale Bilzerian explains it well in this clip. When I got out of boot camp, I'll use that as an example, I go to Outback Steakhouse, I'm at a 10, right? Now, if I go to the best restaurant in the world, I mean, I'm like maybe at like a six or a seven. I'm just like satisfied. I got three chefs. Like I eat the best food all the time. You know what I mean? So like that doesn't make me happy anymore. The best food in the world and it's a six or a seven. That's what hedonic adaptation does. Now, one caveat here is that Dan's always been rich. He doesn't know what it's like to live below the poverty line. That would obviously change his perspective, right? Do you feel that you're happier right now than when you were broke or not really? Sometimes. It's a sometime thing, but I feel like the way that I have money kind of took away a lot of my happiness. If you think a lot of money is gonna make you happy, you never had a lot of money before. At a certain level of poverty, more money can definitely increase your quality of life, but the amount you need to be happy is a lot lower than you think. For example, one of the most famous Stoic philosophers, Epictetus, was born a slave. Yet he found joy and inner peace through the mindset that wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants. Now, maybe your desire isn't for material things. Maybe you just want to achieve your goals. That should make you happy, right? Unfortunately, if you aren't careful, this will just replace the hedonic hamster wheel with the achievement hamster wheel, and you'll find yourself continuously moving the goalpost for what you need to achieve in order to feel like your life is good enough. If it's success, you can never get enough of that. I realize that. It's like, it doesn't stop. It keeps calling you. It's like a drug. This doesn't mean that going after what you want or getting what you want is destined to make you unhappy. But if you can't be happy while you pursue a goal, you won't be happy when you achieve it. In fact, you may be really screwed when you achieve it because you can no longer pretend that that thing will make you happy. I had bought into the not uncommon notion that when I taste success, when I get over there, then I'll be happy. But the strangest thing happened. As the show got more successful, I got more depressed. So what's the solution? You learn to be happy today with what you already have. One tool for this is the stoic practice of negative visualization. It's a quick exercise to feel gratitude for your life as it is. Sam Harris describes it well here. You can think of all the things that could happen to you, right, that haven't. And if any one of them happened to you, you would consider your prayers answered if you could just be returned to this moment. By spending just 5 to 10 minutes meditating on the ways that your life could be worse, you will naturally start to feel more grateful for what you already have. Another secret to happiness is realizing you have the ability to experience happiness right now without needing anything external to trigger it. You are the happiness gatekeeper. You are the only person telling yourself that you aren't allowed to be happy. There's an amazing 8-minute meditation called Uncaused Joy that can help you learn to tap into this internally generated joy that's always available. The meditation is on the Waking Up app. That's something we have no affiliation with. We aren't sponsored. They aren't paying us. But I highly recommend it. Now, I wanted you to be able to experience this meditation for free, so I hunted down a free trial link for you. That link is in the description below. In addition to feeling happier, if you can accept that you need nothing external to be happy, your fear of failure, rejection, judgment, it all basically disappears because you know you can be happy no matter what. Now, on to the next common happiness killer that is sure to make you miserable. Isolated Upward Comparison. This is when you focus on one thing about yourself and then compare it to someone who you think is better than you in that area. For example, listen to this clip of Alex Formosy. Alex is a brilliant businessman. At the time of this clip, he was worth about $35 million. Many of us spend our time envying other people. As our life improves, we simply find new people to envy. The cure to this happiness killer is, again, gratitude. You have to realize there are many, many people who would love to have your life. If that's hard for you to imagine, there are two YouTube channels you need to watch. Special Books by Special Kids and Invisible People. Both do important work bringing awareness to people that society tends to ignore. And both can remind you that you have a lot to be grateful for. A quick warning for this next clip, it's emotional. Even when things in your life are hard, you still have a lot to be grateful for. And if you think your life circumstances are so bad that it's impossible for you to feel grateful, listen to this. There is something important to remember when you're thinking about the people living in tougher conditions than you. You are doing this to help you appreciate your life, not to negatively judge or feel superior to other people. Negatively judging other people is a poison. Judgmental people don't know how to feel good about themselves, so they tear down other people in their mind to give themselves a temporary feeling of superiority. This is extremely self-damaging, because the way you think about other people informs the way you think about yourself. If you are harsh towards other people, then when no one is around, your mind will turn that same habit onto you. Now, on the other hand, if you get into the habit of thinking kind thoughts about other people, showing them compassion and empathy, you're much more likely to do that to yourself, too. There's another great tool for recognizing that you are already living the dream life. It's a quick audio titled, You're Living the Dream Life. It's also on that Waking Up app, but for this one, I actually found a free link so you can listen to it without even having to sign up to the trial. That link is in the description below. There's one more habit we'll cover today that almost everyone allows to ruin their life. Expectations One of the quickest ways to make yourself miserable is with the phrase, supposed to, or alternatively, the word, should. If you have a habit of thinking that someone should have treated you better, or things were supposed to go differently in the past, you are creating a happiness gap between reality and an imagined reality. Epictetus has a lesson that will change your life here if you let it. Happiness and freedom begin by understanding one principle. Some things are in your control, and some things are not. When you learn to distinguish between what you can and can't control, inner peace and outer effectiveness become possible. This doesn't mean you have to pretend everything that happened to you was great. It simply means it happened, you can't undo it, so instead, focus on what you can do now. Sometimes life feels hard. When you spend time telling yourself that things should be a different way, you don't make those hard moments easier, you just add extra suffering on top of whatever you're going through. The author Byron Cady has a great quote here that I love for this. The only time we suffer is when we believe a thought that argues with reality. So how can you stop resenting something that has happened to you? This isn't a cure-all, but one thing that has personally helped me a lot in tough times is recognizing you don't know your future. There's a great Chinese parable that explains this better than I can. It's about a farmer whose only horse runs away. His neighbor sees it happen and says to him, I'm so sorry, that's a terrible loss. And the farmer responds, we'll see. A few days later, the horse comes back and brings seven wild horses with it. His neighbor exclaims, seven horses, you're rich! What good luck! And the farmer says, we'll see. The next day, the farmer's son is trying to tame one of the wild horses and breaks his leg. Their neighbor comes back to offer condolences, that's just terrible luck. And again, the farmer responds, we'll see. And on the last day of this story, the emperor's men come to the village to draft all the young men into the army. The farmer's son with his broken leg can't go. And when his neighbor congratulates the farmer on his good luck, the farmer responds, we'll see. As Roman emperor and famed Stoic Marcus Aurelius said, if you are pained by external things, it is not that they disturb you, but your judgment of them disturbs you. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment. You might think that's easy to say when you're the most powerful person in the world, but this same mindset helped get Epictetus through slavery. He taught, we suffer not from the events in our lives, but from our judgment about them. To end this, I just want to say thank you so much for watching this video. When I do my own gratitude exercises, I feel grateful for you. The lessons I picked for today have all had a great impact on my own life, and I hope they can help you be happier.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 598}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"While watching clips from my last Game of Thrones video, I stumbled across some cast interview clips and I couldn't help but notice how effortlessly charming Emilia Clarke was. Thank you. I decided to watch a few more interviews and sure enough, she displays a number of charismatic habits that while seemingly simple are extremely powerful. So in this video, we are going to break down four of Emilia's habits that make her so charming. Many of these may sound basic at first glance but there are nuances that take them from ordinary basic advice to extremely charismatic if you hit the nuance. The first one of these is a more subtle point but it starts with something that you cannot help but notice when watching Emilia — her beaming and frequent smile. It lights up her whole face. Ha-ha! Smiling is one of the fastest ways to communicate friendly intentions and put other people at ease but since it's so easy to do, people have learned to fake it to their advantage and we, in turn, have learned unconscious ways of detecting which smiles are genuine and which are meant to manipulate us. Subconsciously, we don't look at the mouth but the eyes. If a person's eyes don't have any flexion in the muscles below or around their eyes, we judge that smile to be fake and sometimes distrust the person for that perceived attempt at manipulating us. Emilia isn't even close to triggering this though — look at her eyes in this next clip. And that's not an exaggeration. If you're ever talking to Emilia when she laughs, her eyebrows literally turn upside down. Of course, Emilia isn't focused on squeezing her eye muscles precisely to appear genuine and neither should you be. Instead, her genuine smile comes from allowing herself to find the humor in everything — this is the nuance. And while it might seem like an obvious point, more often than we realize, we restrain ourselves from these genuine smiles or genuine laughter. Sometimes, it's because we're uncomfortable laughing at ourselves. We think that it would hurt our social standing to do that. Emilia proves that a willingness to laugh at yourself is actually extremely charismatic. Hi, I'm Emilia Clarke and you're going to find out some first-time stuff. Not... ... Other times, we hold back on smiling and laughter because we can think of charisma as something that requires us to always be the leader, to be the one in the spotlight. And when we are in this competitive mindset and someone else tells a joke, rather than laugh, we might hold back and look for a way to make people laugh at our next joke. But Emilia doesn't fall into that ego trap. In the next clip, for instance, Seth Meyers is piling on to a story that she had just told and she has no problem shifting the spotlight over to him, making him feel funny, making him the center of attention. By the way, the only thing that would be worse than a guy coming to your house and seeing this is the reverse — you going to a guy's house and seeing this. Exactly. Exactly. That's a real like... Yeah. It's counterintuitive but highlighting the people around you, making them feel funny, well-liked, like they have the spotlight on them, leads to your own charisma rising. Now, Emilia's willingness to smile and laugh freely actually leads to our second major point and it's when our sarcastic comedic instincts might tell us to cut someone down, Emilia often takes those opportunities to build people up. Now, the reverse is especially common in young men who learn to say things like, cool story, bro, when someone makes a bad joke. But Emilia avoids these low blows. Jimmy Fallon, in this next clip, cracks a lame joke and rather than tease him for it, she supports it, gets the audience behind him. Smashed it. Smashed it. In England, that means cool, right? Killed it. Yeah. Slay. Okay. I just made up something. I like it. I like it. I'll take that. It's okay. Slay. Yeah, that works. You generate massive goodwill when you laugh with someone rather than at them and yes, even though the whole room might laugh when you pick on one individual, it's usually better to take the supportive role and you can still be funny while doing it. Our videos on yes ending dive deeper into this topic if you'd like more. Now, to be clear, I don't mean to say that you can never lovingly tease people. Emilia does it on occasion but interestingly, she often find ways to sneak subtle compliments into those teases. Watch as she teases Kit Harington for complaining about his heavy outfit on Game of Thrones set. On the one hand, she is lightly mocking him for complaining but she also says this... Always in the cold. I know. He does really like to tell everyone that. Yeah, he does. It's really heavy. It's really heavy. So, but you get to be like warm places wearing silk, right? Yeah. Well, no. See, this is the thing. Kit always complains because he's always in... and it's a very heavy cloak. It's a very heavy cloak. It smells terrible. Yeah, he's got abs. He's not holding them up and so he's fine. ...to still be cracking jokes but make the punchline that your friends and loved ones are attractive, well-liked, and cool. Chris Evans is an expert at this. I'm going to link to a video with him below but here are just a few quick examples. I get Pratt. I never get Hemsworth which is really upsetting. Please think I'm Hemsworth. Please think I'm Hemsworth. I feel like the godfather of these superhero movies. Whether he feels it or not, he is. You know, he's going to say something really like humble and simple and be like, oh, no, it would have happened anyway. This wouldn't have happened without Downey and nobody doesn't know that. Back to Amelia Clarke. I suspect that part of the reason that those genuine positive emotions come so easily to her is because unlike so many people, she isn't trying to have normal interactions. She doesn't want to blend in and match the energy of the room. Instead, she almost always raises the energy of the interactions that she's involved in. This is an extremely powerful habit even though it isn't always immediately noticeable. In this next clip, you can see how her enthusiasm seems to be one level above the people that she's speaking to first in her introduction and then in the questions that are asked of her. Good to see you again. Lovely to see you as well. Is it frustrating at all that you can't talk about it? Yeah, deeply. I can't wait for this to be out. I'm just going to say it. I know it. People can have like emotional connections to their scene partners. I really do. Genuinely. Upping our energy level can be a scary thing to do because our default is to try to be normal, to blend in. But when you come in with one energy level higher than a group, one level sillier than the situation calls for, people almost always appreciate it. Even when we're in a serious business mode or cool professional mode, we love to be reminded of the lighter side of life and Amelia does this frequently with her higher more playful energy. And just in case you were thinking this doesn't apply to business settings, listen to the Game of Thrones producers talk about how Amelia won the role of Daenerys Targaryen in a high-stakes audition even though she had never acted outside of a few bit roles. It was quite possibly the least inviting audition environment we had ever witnessed. Still, the president of the company was playing it close to the chest. He nodded. Amelia asked if there was anything else she could do to lighten the mood. David asked, can you dance? And without missing a beat, Amelia did the robot. And even the president had no choice but to smile. She got the job 10 seconds after she left the room and the two of us ran to tell her. So when you find yourself in any social situation, don't try to be normal. Try to have fun even if it means you're the first one to be more enthusiastic, energetic, or positive. Now the last very simple habit that makes Amelia so effortlessly charming is that she is an active listener. She makes the people communicating with her feel validated and heard. Now you've already seen examples of this in her validating jokes from other people but active listening can be even more subtle than that. For instance, she often listens while repeating phrases that that person has just said. It's just weird. It's weird, isn't it? It's like 50-60 people watching you. Yeah, I can relate to some of those things. Other times, she simply says words that are encouraging and affirmative. But everybody plays because there's a lot of downtime and you all play heads up. Yeah, exactly. No, we do. We do, yes. It's a fun game. It passes the time. Exactly. It happens. It was all a dream. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. The cool thing about this habit is that it is very under the radar. People begin to feel good and to associate that feeling with you without really knowing why and it contributes to them feeling, I don't really know how to explain it but I just like them. There are a lot of ways to be charming but I think Amelia highlights one of the most elegant. You make other people feel good by modeling how to feel good yourself. When you are happy and are comfortable expressing it in a generous way with your smiles, your laughter, your affirmations of other people, it has a way of rubbing off and making them perceive you as more charismatic. Now, if you're looking for more resources on how to really lock in these confident positive habits, I highly recommend checking out our course, Charisma University. I love, love, love this channel but part of the issue with it is that these can become ideas that stay in your head as pure theory.

Each day has a specific action guide with one thing that you can do so simple that anyone can do it. It's a 30-day program and it's that day after day action-taking that really is what creates change over the long haul.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Almost all of our expectations about love and relationships have been set by Hollywood. The problem is that these movies are putting absurd ideas into our minds about what love really looks like, which can lead to some boneheaded decision-making, maybe even ruining what could have been a great relationship. So in this video, we're going to look at eight ways that Hollywood ruins your relationships. And a caveat here, this goes against romantic conventional wisdom that is often espoused by friends, family, and Instagram quotes. And I share it in the hopes that it improves the quality of your relationships, even though a major theme is that I'm trying to take you off of love's roller coaster, which actually brings us to the first point and the title of the video, movies train us to substitute emotional intensity for emotional quality. This is the bipolar nature of Hollywood romance. You can think about it from a scale of negative 10 to positive 10, and a Hollywood romance lives at the extremes. For instance, the Beast is awful to Belle, kidnapping her, and then they have their beautiful dance, then they have to fight for love, and finally, they are reunited. In The Notebook, Noah and Allie are head over heels in love, then painfully separated, then reunited with tons of drama to spare, and this scene displays it well visually. The biggest offender here is probably Twilight. There are too many whiplash moments in the series to count and the entire series is about the rush and obsession that comes with being together, followed by the suicidal depression that the characters experience when they're torn apart. Now, the list goes on and on, but the point is that these relationships are driven not by positive experiences, but by drama, as defined by the dramatic reversal of fortune. And to be fair, this goes back way before Hollywood. Romeo and Juliet, the most well-known romance of all time, is a story about two 13-year-olds who've known each other for five days before deciding to commit suicide when they can't be together. Now, you may inadvertently be chasing the same rollercoaster relationships and passing up on the ones that are just consistently good, thinking that if there isn't drama, there must not be love and you would be better served to aim for a genuine lack of drama in your relationships, something that would make for an uninteresting movie can make for an incredible relationship. Now, our second point has to do with how we find our partners. Most movies pander to the fantasy that despite how bumbling, awkward, and uninteresting others may find you, the perfect person will magically take interest because they see the real you deep inside. Take Fifty Shades of Grey, for example, where a 27-year-old self-made billionaire takes special interest in a socially awkward college student that's interviewing him for the school paper. The roles are reversed in The Girl Next Door where the beautiful and spontaneous Danielle literally shows up on Matthew's doorstep to take him on crazy adventures despite the fact that he demonstrates nothing interesting about himself. So what's the craziest thing you've done lately? Oh, I mean, it's hard to tell, you know, because I've just done so much nuts stuff. I mean, it's just off the hook, off the walls. I mean... You haven't done anything, have you? The fantasy here is that without changing anything, your dream guy or girl will pluck you up and whisk you into a magical life. Now, the truth which we all encounter every single day is that no one is going to pick you if you're morose or uninteresting. If you want someone spontaneous, fun-loving, or accomplished, your best bet is to put in the effort to become that type of person. Otherwise, you won't even catch their eye when your paths do cross. Another early relationship trope that you will see is love at first sight and it looks like this. I'm really very sorry. Wow. And it's no mistake that in every version of this trope from The Little Mermaid to Twilight or The Notebook, the person that's being seen is impossibly beautiful which is your first clue that love at first sight has far more to do with fleeting attraction than with long-lasting love. Now, unfortunately, this makes us incredibly prone to mistaking attraction for love in our own lives. Then, like our favorite movies, we ignore the wise advice of our friends and justify sacrificing our values and goals in the name of love. Despite the swelling music that frequently accompanies these scenes, don't be fooled. It's not romantic and attractive to be googly-eyed for someone that you don't yet know. It's shallow and it's a disservice to the friends and the family who have probably been there for you your entire life. Now, one particular symptom of buying into the trope of love at first sight is the refusal to take no for an answer which is our fourth point. Love in Hollywood is proven by ignoring rejection. Here's The Notebook's Noah asking Ally, for instance, to dance after seeing her just for a few seconds. You wanna dance with me? No. Why not? Because I don't want to. Now, it would be fine if this was the end of it but Noah, of course, goes on to threaten suicide if Ally won't go on a date with him. All right, well, you leave me no other choice then. Oh, my God! Okay, okay, fine. I'll go out with you. And while she does give in in that scene, she winds up still avoiding him which makes sense but, of course, Noah tracks her down in the street and presses her further. These are the behaviors of a stalker and we see it romanticized in several other films. Pop Culture Detective has an entire video on this stalking as love trope alone. Other times, the rejection that we see takes the form of self-disqualification where the person says that they would make for a terrible partner. Here's Natalie Portman in No Strings Attached clearly signaling that she's not interested in a loving relationship. Why don't you go find some other girl who's not gonna hurt you? Because I love you. But, of course, the romantic plot insists that Ashton ignore her which, of course, works out in the end. Part of Edward Cullen's entire mysterious appeal is that he says outright that he's not a good match. What does that mean? It means if you're smart, you'd stay away from me. In the real world, do yourself a favor. When someone tells you that they're bad for you or not ready for a relationship or just not interested, take them at their word. Now, of course, every relationship will have its rough patches. The standard way to handle these is our fifth crazy trope and it's giving large unrequested gifts as a way to make amends. I've picked on this movie a bunch already but The Notebook is just a repeat offender so here it goes again. For context, Noah dates Allie for one summer when they are 17 years old. They separate and over 10 years pass. Then Noah sees Allie and discovers that she's happily engaged to her wonderful fiance. So Noah completely rebuilds the house where they lost their virginity in an attempt to win Allie back. Because the plot demands it, this works. They live happily ever after. Similarly, John Cusack blasted a boombox over his head to get back with his girlfriend and say anything. And public declarations of love like in Crazy Stupid Love are commonplace in these films. The problem here is twofold. First, if you've ended a relationship with someone, it gives the impression that a grand gesture should be grounds for reconsideration which, of course, ignores the fact that many people can be great at grand gestures and completely weak on the day-to-day joy that makes a relationship worth having in the first place. The other issue is that we learn to pursue partners who won't accept a simple heartfelt apology when we've done wrong. We joke that someone might be in the doghouse without recognizing that their partner is holding the relationship ransom pending the delivery of a large, often expensive gift. So when a partner won't forgive, you are better off apologizing and then granting them the space they've requested rather than trying to Hollywood your way back into their life. Now I mentioned Allie's fiance in the last bit which is our sixth point and it's that, according to Hollywood, pursuing someone who is currently in a relationship is romantic and not at all doomed to failure. We see this in the Titanic, Wedding Crashers, even Casino Royale though, of course, it's treated less romantically in his case. You're not my type. Smart. Single. In The Wedding Singer, it's made even worse by the fact that Adam Sandler is supposed to be helping Drew Barrymore in her wedding, not wrecking it. Now, any sort of moral compunction for breaking up a pre-existing couple is avoided in these films usually by making the significant other an irredeemable jerk. Wedding Crashers makes Zach a complete caricature of a prep school jerk — a cheating entitled ass. But it's not solely on behalf of the other guy or gal that you don't want to spend time trying to break up existing couples. It's because it's very tough to feel secure in a relationship with someone who you know is willing to betray their partner. There are so many singles out there and focusing on someone that's unavailable only reinforces a scarce mindset when it comes to finding love which brings us to our next point. Suffering, dependence, self-sacrifice are all treated as indicators of love. In fact, there are often tests of love like in A Knight's Tale where Jocelyn insists that William lose repeated jousts in order to prove his love to her. This is not without consequence as William is injured to the point of being unable to walk afterwards. According to Twilight, the only way that you know a relationship is real is if you suffer deeply afterwards. The teenage Bella sits for a months-long depression after Edwards leaves and affirms this point. The pain is my only reminder that he was real. Even the sisterly love in Frozen is defined by the willingness to sacrifice one's own life. What's common to all these scenarios is that love is proven by pain and if you buy into that, it's exactly what you'll create in your relationships. You'll make opportunities for yourself and your partner to suffer as a testament to love. But there is another view on love that it's marked by acceptance, joy, and mutual growth that love can be so transformative that even when a relationship ends, both parties are happier, better people for having experienced it. And rather than codependence with a beloved individual, love could be marked by a more positive approach to all of life such that it weren't meaningless if that person were gone for some reason. But, of course, that lacks dramatic swing so we don't see it on screen. And this takes us to the crux of all of this, what I believe is the most serious problem in so many of our movies, songs, and novels. It's that a romantic relationship is the de facto solution to the problem of life specifically that we so often feel alone and incomplete. Hercules says it here. Meg, when I'm with you, I don't feel so alone. And the most romantic scene in Jerry Maguire is him reaffirming this point. You complete me. And I just had— Shut up. Just shut up. You had me at hello. Now these movies deserve credit because they do get something right. Something does feel like it's missing for many people but the answer is not necessarily romance. In fact, these movies often overlook what is probably a more foundational piece. For instance, family is often denigrated. Hercules gives up his family for a woman who has mostly lied to him and manipulated him. Ariel leaves her family behind after only three days with Prince Eric when she didn't even speak to him. Similarly, friends are often ignored or viewed as buffoonish impediments to the true prize of romantic love. Now this isn't to say that intimate relationships are always bad. They can be wonderful but the protagonist's willingness in these movies to give up their friends and family is a cop-out of one of love's most important lessons — that it can heal and improve the sometimes difficult relationships with the people we've known the longest. Instead, Hollywood would have a search for new magical significant others rather than understanding, forgiving, and loving our families and friends. But beyond even friends and family, there is a deeper lesson that's not emphasized in most movies and it's that self-love is the foundation of a happy life and of a happy relationship. This means that instead of relying on others to fill you up, you give yourself the love and acceptance you've been conditioned to expect from a romantic partner. You learn to not feel lonely in your own company, to feel complete when you're not tied to someone else. And this allows you to let go of the narrow view of romantic love that would see you made lovesick for longing of a particular individual and it opens up the possibility for a view of life and love that is less romantic but it's more heartwarming. The king of rom-coms, Hugh Grant, says it the best. If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around. The journey to inner self-confidence that makes you feel totally secure and that naturally attracts others, of course, can take time but it is absolutely worth it not only because it helps you effortlessly attract amazing relationships, friendships, and career opportunities but also for the confidence that you feel even when you're alone. If you want to get started on that journey or speed it up tremendously, I highly recommend checking out our flagship program, Charisma University. Charisma University is a simple step-by-step guided course that is guaranteed to make you more charismatic and more confident in just 30 days. Inside of Charisma University, you will discover instantly useful techniques to radically boost your charisma and confidence and while it is focused on social confidence, inevitably, that begins to spill over into other situations in your life as well. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below but I think hearing from members is the best way to let you know more about the course. So here are just a few of the things that members have written in via email or the course comments. The first one is from a guy who used Charisma University to transform his social and dating life. He says, life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with just a few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere he goes. The next member writes in after having crushed an interview and landing a job through Charisma University. He says, I interviewed at dozens of places for jobs after medical school. At the end of one of my interview days, the doctor came to me, pulled me aside, and said I was hands-down the best interview out of everybody and that they would love to have me at their program. They ranked me number one and it's my current job. This last one comes from another guy who says Charisma University helped his dating life and he writes, firstly, loving your course. I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation module. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we are dating. Now, Charisma University also comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee that is 100% for any reason at all. That means that there's no risk on your part. Either you become more charismatic and confident or you can get every single penny back. Now, if that interests you and you want to find out more about Charisma University, I highly recommend that you click the link on the screen or in the description. If you do, I will look forward to seeing you on the inside. Either way, I hope that you've enjoyed today's video and I will see you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 864}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Game of Thrones has kept its fans hooked for over 20 years. The excitement that I and millions of other people feel as season 8 approaches is a testament to the power of its storytelling. So in this video, I want to talk about three reasons its story is so genius and show how those reasons actually predict how it will all end based on the story's structure. And there, of course, will be spoilers up to book 5 and season 7 including those books and seasons. So to begin with, fiction often treats good and evil as uncrossing opposites. Harry Potter is basically a saint and Voldemort is pure evil. Captain America is all that is virtuous. Red Skull is a literal Nazi zombie. Recent villains like Thanos and Killmonger have added some depth to the Avengers universe but by and large, our fictional antagonists are pure evil. Defeating them is unambiguously right. Game of Thrones, though, is populated by morally gray multi-dimensional humans. Yes, some of them are despicable, nasty humans and we rejoice when they get their comeuppance but almost none can be reduced to the embodiment of evil. Now, the theme of gray characters has been explored recently in popular fiction. By itself, it's not enough to elevate a series but the genius of Game of Thrones is that it doesn't initially present itself as having that subtlety. Jaime Lannister seems to be the quintessential one-dimensional villain until book and season 3 when we learn that he saved an entire city and no one has any idea. Theon Greyjoy goes from being a background character to a traitor of his best friend and murderer of little boys but then his torture is so brutal that we can't help but feel for him and root for his redemption. Robb Stark appears to be perfectly good avenging his father and never losing a battle, making sound strategic decisions but then his sense of honor and short-sighted desire to choose his own wife causes him to break a marriage pledge which results in the slaughter of everyone that he cares about. It seems that no matter how evil, minor, or one-dimensional a character may seem, we will one day be forced to encounter their humanity and that is one of the core strengths of Game of Thrones that we would do well to remember in our daily lives. Humanity exists where you least expect it. Now, I'm not sure how the show will handle it but I would bet that the books extend this principle to the seeming embodiment of evil in the series — the White Walkers also known as the Others. And I think that would poetically sum up the point that applies equally to storytelling and life even though they may appear to be shallow or evil at first, the Other has humanity as well. Which brings us to the second point — drama is built on the reversal of fortune and I don't think anyone out there now does reversals better than George RR Martin. You see it in the arc of just about every single character but perhaps no one exemplifies this better than Daenerys. She starts out an exiled princess, is made into a slave bride, becomes favored and prepped to take over the world then her undefeated husband is killed from a graze with a knife. Then when it looks like she's committing suicide, she emerges from fire with dragons and that's all in the first book. After that, she wanders the wastes and nearly starves. We think that she must give up a dragon only for her to inquire an entire army without losing a single dragon. She becomes queen and then again loses everything all over again including her dragons. And it's finally when she is enslaved and alone that she becomes the most powerful ruler on Westeros in the span of just a few minutes. But it's not simply the reversal of fortune that makes for brilliant storytelling. It's that the characters are actively causing these reversals. Whether it's through her mistaken trust or through her brilliant gambits, Daenerys is authoring the changes in her life. And now we see the same thing with Jaime Lannister. It's his own choices that lead to him losing his hand. Game of Thrones is a world full of active characters making choices that significantly impact their fortune. This is the lifeblood of drama. So let's take everything we've discussed and make some predictions on how the ending can incorporate all of these themes. First off, the White Walkers slash others will be humanized in the end. At least in the books, we're going to find out that the others are not just the embodiment of evil but that they have sympathetic reasons for attacking the South. Now, I do not believe that the war is going to end in an outright destruction of the others but instead in some kind of truce. Second, Jon and or Dany will have to make decisions that completely reverse their fortunes. First, that's going to mean saving the war when all seems lost. But additionally, the love story they have begun is going to come to a tragic end. Only one of them can make it to the end as a flesh-and-blood human. That's what reversal of fortunes mean. The other one is going to have to go out in a heroic sacrifice either by dying or perhaps even turning into another to establish the truce that I mentioned. So we have multi-dimensional characters making active and impactful decisions that drive the plot forward. That alone would be enough to form the bedrock of an excellent and addictive story but George adds one more major piece and I think this is the most unique. It's that Game of Thrones is a hidden hero's journey. Now, the hero's journey is a story structure that Joseph Campbell noticed in many of the most popular stories and myths from around the world. There are many elements to it and some may be omitted in each particular case but at a high level, we start with the boy of humble origins who is secretly of important lineage. He uncovers his own magical properties and has to master a challenging and dangerous weapon to defeat a supernatural evil and bring peace to the realm. Along the way, he finds a mentor who must die so that he can face the final evil on his own and very likely, he gets the girl. Bonus points if the story is titled after this humble boy so that we know exactly who to keep our eyes on all along. You've seen this arc play out in hundreds of different ways and it remains satisfying yet predictable. Now, given how closely Game of Thrones adheres to the hero's journey, you'd think that it would be the same way — predictable — but it's not — not even close and it's because George hides the elements of the hero's journey in plain sight. For instance, the series is called A Song of Ice and Fire — a confusing title that fans usually just replace with the title of the first book, A Game of Thrones. Now, most people do not realize that the entire series has always applied to Jon Snow the whole time because Jon Snow is secretly the son of Lyanna Stark representing ice and Rhaegar Targaryen representing fire. When we see Jon fall in love with Ygritte, we presume that things are finally back on track after Ned Stark's death and the Red Wedding but then Jon tragically and unheroically loses her and we assume that the hero's journey is completely off the rails forever. And most importantly, for 80% of the first season and book, George gives us the perspective of the main character's uncle. We logically assume that Ned and then Robb are our heroes so when they're killed, we experience the horrible thrill of feeling like anything can happen and this is George's genius. We love the hero's journey but we're bored of the fake peril that comes from knowing that the hero must survive until the final act. In hiding our heroes by connecting us with Jon's uncle and then killing him, we feel as if anything can happen. The same deception plays out to a lesser extent with Dany and Khal Drogo. This makes us feel that every moment in the story could go sideways — many do — while still treating us to the most psychologically satisfying story arc ever told and when we find out that this has been a hero's journey all along, there is a rush like no other. Now, since I believe that this is essentially Jon's story since it's called the Song of Ice and Fire, I believe that this series ends when Jon ends so I'm predicting that we will see Dany remain alive with Jon's child. That seems to at least be where the show is pointing us though I have to acknowledge that the books have prophesized that Jon may have to sacrifice Dany in order to defeat the Night King. I am not 100% sure if it's going to be Jon or Dany that survives but I very strongly believe that everything we've seen points to only one of them making it through. If you're like me, this is going to be a bittersweet end because I've never found a story that captivated me like a Song of Ice and Fire and I will miss it. There is good news though for those of you like me who are anticipating withdrawal and it's that George RR Martin wrote three excellent short stories that a lot of people don't know about. They are set in the world of Game of Thrones. I've gone through each of them twice and you can check them out today for free courtesy of our sponsor, Audible.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"I have been afraid to make this video before very very recently and I was afraid to make it because I knew that I hadn't gotten to the core of the answer why I quit. I feel like I'm there now and I want to share with you guys. So rather than beat around the bush because I will give you the long story, the short version is that my co-founder and I, Ben, had a large falling out and that falling out was due to a deep lack of alignment in how we wanted to run the business and how we felt we'd each contributed to the business and it led to a stalemate between he and I as 50-50 partners and essentially the starvation death of Charisma on Command. The longer version of that story is that, for those of you who don't know, Ben and I started this channel over a decade ago. We've been friends for more than two decades. We were best friends in high school. We spoke every day throughout college even though we lived in different cities. We were thick as thieves and when we started this business the whole idea was that it was going to be us together living our dream life and it was. It was incredible. We went to Brazil. We started this channel. It was never meant to be the size that it got to but it happened and then probably five-ish years ago I started noticing something about myself that I didn't like and it was that I was being mean. I was being unkind when he would die in a team video game. I was frustrated by our interactions together and feeling put upon to call him to go to certain events and I didn't like that about myself and for a long time I tried to change and be different and work on whatever was going on inside of me and it took a long time to see that what was happening there was that resentments from business issues and things I hadn't addressed in other areas of our friendship were surfacing in the areas where it was safe because if I got upset in a video game it didn't mean that we were going to have to end our 20-year codependent streak of doing every single thing together but if I acknowledged what I was actually feeling which was under supported in work like we had different motivating forces for why we were doing what we were doing and deeply out of alignment with him then the worst would have happened which would have been maybe we would have had to separate we couldn't have had the togetherness that we'd had since high school and of course what you resist persists I allowed that resentment to build inside of me until I just snapped and said I don't want to talk anymore and that was about two years ago and I didn't know at the time exactly all of the stuff that I'm sharing with you now it was over the course of reflection of years that I sort of realized that one of the key things that was in our business I think perhaps the easiest way to explain to someone who wasn't there without saying that my perception is objectively correct is that when it came time to add up responsibility for something that maybe didn't go well in the business if you took the percentage that I would assign to myself of my contribution and the percentage that he would assign to himself for his contribution we would not add up to 100% and if you took something that did go well there was credit to be taken for something and you took the amount that I would authentically give to myself and the amount that he would authentically give to himself you had a number that was greater than 100% and there was no amount of dialogue that changed that and in sensing that and sensing that we were seeing the world in fundamentally different ways different ideas about what was causing particular effects different ideas about what was driving the heart of the business and in fact that that was a key piece of it was that I looked at it perhaps more artistically romantically spiritually even we were not on the same page and not addressing that for years not allowing this honest and authentic decision to split to actually occur when it probably could have occurred in a much more gentle loving way years before created the huge rift so since then I've reached out to him we've started to reconnect we've talked about what broke down in the friendship and we've talked about what happened in the business relationship and we still don't see things exactly the same in the business relationship which speaks to the depth of lack of alignment that we have but they've been good conversations they've been connecting they've been healing lots of wonderful things have come from it one of those wonderful things is that I have purchased all of Charisma on Command so I am 100% owner of Charisma on Command from now probably until eternity because I cannot imagine letting this thing go at this point and I'm very very excited about that uh without being too sappy it feels like a piece of my heart is back home and it was not on Ben that it strayed it was the codependent aspects in me that prized doing things with the people I love above doing things in a way that was authentic to me and that's a pattern that has run through all of my life as I have tried to take family and friends into the weird fringe life that I have set up for myself and I've seen this pattern play out over and over again and I am ready to put an end to it so in terms of what to expect I'll start with Ben I believe and there's certainly an aspect and I've heard this from Ben that elements of the split while incredibly painful were wonderful for him in that he started living a life that was much more in line with I think where he would have gone without my influence which is he immediately started a family he now has two children he has a wife he's a dedicated father it's the thing that I see when I talk to him light him up and move him and feels like where his heart is and was and was always headed and so I'm very very happy for him in terms of content he may decide to make something but right now that's not what he wants to do if that changes I will tell you guys I want you guys to be able to find anything that he makes I want him to be able to access all the people that might have liked content that he made just because I don't necessarily want to do it with him anymore does not mean that I don't want the world to hear his voice so that's him in terms of me I'm so excited to get back to creating it was a self-inflicted wound that I stopped making videos in an attempt it was so backwards to like let him catch up to the contribution that I felt I had contributed by kneecapping my own creative instinct which just hurt all around and it was a totally codependent backwards unconscious way of dealing with this whole problem so I'm excited to get to create again I'm so excited to share everything that I've learned these are things like boundaries codependency coping mechanisms projection all this kind of stuff and I'm excited to do it in the charisma on command way which is in a way that is fun for you guys whether it's wrapped with Robert Downey jr or game of thrones or whatever is cool nowadays I'm so excited to make fun videos about the things that I wish I had known two three four five years ago so that's number one look out for way more videos probably at least one a week well I shouldn't say at least look out for one a week to start some old charisma command videos some new formats some podcasts I'm going to start to incorporate the podcast channel in a more meaningful way and bring segments over to the main charisma on command channel that's one thing the second thing is I want to make the most powerful program on uncovering the self-confidence that you already have that has ever existed I want it for my fans I want it for myself it is truly it just speaks to me that's what I want to do and so I've learned a tremendous amount that's going to take time if you're already in charisma university look out for improvements I don't know exactly what those will be but I just I want it to be excellent and also look out for new programs because while charisma university is an online at your own pace program I want to have other things that are cohort based and in person where you're interacting with other people that's been hugely hugely helpful for me as I've gone through this entire multi-year transformation really and so I want to offer that in the unique charisma on command way to anyone who has felt connected to this content and that's what's up that's why I quit that's why I'm back I just want to say at the end of this thank you guys if you have ever watched are watching or will watch a video it has been a honor and a privilege to share everything that I've learned with you guys the channel is a thinly veiled diary of mine where I try to share the most meaningful pieces of advice and guidance that have helped me in the struggles that I've had in my life in the hopes that you can move more gracefully through them in yours and whether that's what do I text this girl or how do I talk to my boss to get a promotion or what do I say to keep the conversation going or how do I deal with all of the stuff that I've been going through in the last couple years that's what I want to offer it's truly a gift to do it and whether you love it or hate it or idealize it or demonize it or disagree or agree I so so appreciate literally all of it it is an honor and a pleasure and I'm so excited to be back.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 611}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Elon. Elon Musk. Richest man in the world. You're actually like a world-class incredible video game player. Yeah, I don't have a lifetime of playing video games. Even if Elon Musk doesn't really do much work as a CEO, he likely wouldn't have enough time to play this. Elon Musk is lying about being good at video games. My understanding is that he's been paying good players to play under his username. It's very clear from the live stream he did, it's not actually his character. And this is the worst thing possible, and that would be a fake gamer. The richest, most powerful man arguably in the history of the world was just caught pretending to be better at video games than he really is. And people have dunked on Elon, understandably. Okay, I guess he's just that much of a god gamer. He isn't better than every single other person on the planet. He's got all the money in the world and all the insecurity imaginable. But the psychology behind this is genuinely sad, and it's something we need to explore, because not knowing about it can ruin your life and lead to malignant narcissism. But before we get into the psychology, first, the context. Just two weeks after a game called Path of Exile dropped, Elon live-streamed himself playing with a ridiculously high-level character. In fact, it was in the top 10 across the world. And he repeatedly referred to this character as if he had gotten him to that point. And I've died several times trying to get there. It's kind of grueling to build a hardcore character, so I think if Perseverance dies, that'll be my last character. My staff is only level 62, so I haven't been able to find a better staff, you know, in over 30 levels. Now, the problem with this claim is that getting that high in level in the short window the game had been out would have required about 10 hours a day of continuous playing. So he's ranked in, like, an absurdly high level in these games, a level that can only get to—if you play straight, like, 40 hours, like— A week. You know, in two days. Something that would have been very hard for anyone, let alone a man running multiple billion-dollar companies and preparing for a presidential transition. Elon! Wait, Elon, how are you logged into the game, Elon? How are you logged into the game? Wait, explain. And if you needed any more proof that Elon is 100% boosted, he was playing the game today, inside of Maps, blasting, while simultaneously on a X space. Multiple streamers caught this immediately and exposed Elon for not only stretching the physical limits of time and space, but also for generally not knowing much about the game he was supposedly one of the best in the world at. There are four things there. This one has the real risk of dying. Four things? What are those things? Four things. It's four things, dude. Oh, by the way, I'm completely convinced he didn't play the character. Then, when a streamer named Asmongold picked this story up and commented on it— I'm a huge fan of Elon Musk. I really like Elon Musk a lot, but this is embarrassing and very silly. Elon insulted him on X, said he was not his own man, implying that his video editors somehow had sort of control over him, and then mysteriously Asmon's blue check disappeared on X, though it did come back shortly after people pointed this out. And then, after about two weeks of this criticism, Elon claimed over DMs on X that of course he boosted his account, and that he never claimed otherwise, which is technically true. He just did this. And I've died several times trying to get there. And I've died. It's kind of grueling to build a hardcore character, so I think if Perseverance dies, that'll be my last character. That'll be my last character. This story has captivated a lot of people, but I think there's something critical that has been left out— the psychology behind it all, which is important not just for Elon but for you, because if you're not aware of it, it can literally ruin your life. And it's the sad pipeline from shame to toxic shame to narcissism. Now, shame is the feeling we get when our actions don't align with our values or the values of our group. It feels uncomfortable and that discomfort is what calls our attention to the need to make a change either in our behavior or to the environment we're in. We just leave the group. Toxic shame is the pervasive belief that you are not enough, can never be enough, and must endlessly work to not have that terrible truth be discovered by anyone. The belief follows this pattern. First, I did something bad. Therefore, I am bad. Therefore, I must hide. Some people hide in a very typical way. They avoid being noticed, refuse to speak up, and don't pursue relationships or their goals so they can never be rejected or fail. Other people, though, hide in a very different way. They step constantly into the spotlight but do it wearing a mask of perfection. This brand of toxic shame will make them endlessly pursue more external success and validation. They'll focus more on image than on character. They tell lies that seem completely unnecessary from the outside and tie their well-being to whatever their obsessive metric is whether it's money, looks, fame, or power. This makes them compulsively pursue things that don't make them happy because dropping that pursuit and facing the shame head-on is even worse. I hate that job anyway. I see why you just don't quit. Because I want to fit in. The tendency to turn shame into toxic shame is often set in childhood when we experience some form of trauma that makes us feel unlovable just the way we are. In Elon's case, he suffered serious abuse both from his father and peers. I mean, we lived in torture. It was emotional, psychological torture. Which growing up was just an inherently very violent place. I got punched in the face many times. I almost got beaten to death once. So, many times. Now, even if your trauma isn't that severe, almost everyone I know has a degree of toxic shame that they aren't fully aware of so it runs in the background often surfacing as overthinking in social situations or overreacting to perceived judgments and criticisms. The cruel irony here is that this makes us lose our ability to lovingly own our flaws, to poke fun at ourselves, or to take responsibility for our mistakes which then tends to make the judgment from others even worse. And if you've been a fan of the channel, you know that the opposite of toxic shame — things like focusing more on your character than your reputation, owning your flaws, poking fun at yourself, feeling comfortable building other people up — these are all key components of what drive your charisma. But it can get even worse. If toxic shame isn't addressed head-on, it can fester into malignant narcissism. That is where the pattern gets one more step. I hide by feeling superior to everyone. At this point, the shame is so unbearable that it becomes almost fully unconscious. This person loses awareness of the tremendous amount of pain and self-hatred that they're carrying but it doesn't make it go away. It means that they begin to externalize that pain onto others sometimes with no provocation. Get a goddamn job, Al. And if someone, purposely or not, activates that unconscious core of shame, the narcissist will do everything they can to destroy them. Patrick Bateman is a heightened but quintessential expression of this pipeline. I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello. We should have gone to Dorcia. I could have gotten us a table. Nobody goes there anymore. So, for your internal self-esteem, your charisma, and the sake of everyone around you, you need to address toxic shame directly. That means changing your pattern from, I did something bad, therefore, I am bad, therefore, I must hide to, I did something I'm not proud of, therefore, I'm learning, therefore, I will take responsibility and make amends where I can. And there are many, many ways to approach this but I want to give you just one practice you can do in 60 seconds and it is genuinely magical if you do it with intention. Find a spot where you can be alone. You can do it right now if you want or you can do it later tonight when you're alone in your bed. This won't take long. Then, when you are there, put your attention in your chest, on your heart, and say these words out loud to yourself taking as much time in between phrases as you need. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you. I love you. This practice is based on the Hawaiian tradition known as Ho'oponopono and it might sound simple but I don't know anything as close to magic words as these four phrases. I recommend you give it a try now and tonight as you lay in your bed. Seriously. But sadly, most people don't ever address their shame directly and when I see someone like Elon so clearly acting it out, I feel sad and genuinely sorry for the pain that I know underlies those strange behaviors and for everyone who has walked with that pain and let it out in ways that they're not proud of and I count myself in that group. By the way, that doesn't mean that his or anyone else's externalization of that pain is justified. Totally the opposite. Victims easily become bullies and they need to reflect and adjust when they drift in that direction. I just hope that Elon can grow in a way that decreases his shame and that he doesn't use his immense resources to build more of a wall against it because untreated toxic shame will eat you alive. And to see them casting stones in your direction, it's difficult. Now, if you want shame or self-doubt to play a much smaller role in your life, you might want to start by leveling up your confidence and charisma with our course, Charisma University. And rather than tell you about the program myself, here's just a few things that past members have said. I had confidence in some areas but not in others. Then, Charisma University changed that for me. Since the beginning of the program, I've seen noticeable changes in my life. It's helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. Another member wrote, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. In conversations, I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think. I feel much happier all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman that I've had a crush on for about a year and made a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep going back to it whenever I need a refresher on the daily action modules. And lastly, one member wrote, Thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma University, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values and I know who I am. Now, the program is a step-by-step 30-day program and it is literally guaranteed to change your life. That means you can take the entire course and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a refund right from inside the program.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Oh my god, when I'm talking, you're not talking. I'm sorry. No, when I'm talking, you're not talking. He mumbles, I'm sorry. She is no longer respecting his answer. Huge, huge mistake. Oh my god, you're distracting me right now. I'm sorry. Like, now you're just doing that. Another I'm sorry. Why are you distracting me? I'm just captivated by your behavior. Yeah, you're just distracting me. Oh my god, stop. You're annoying me. Stop. This is why, yes, we'll have to just cut him out of the show. That kind of disrespect is the last thing you want to have happen to you. What is crazy about this particular interview is that while the entire internet sort of dogpiled Alec Baldwin's wife, they were saying they felt so bad for Alec, what they missed and what people miss in their life are the nice guy things that Alec did all leading up to this that basically guaranteed that she treated him with disrespect, lost attraction to him, didn't trust him. And I can imagine that this type of disdain and contempt might be fairly commonplace in their relationship. Rather than dive into what is going on behind the scenes with them, I'm going to use this as an example of six things that a lot of nice guys are doing all the time that are guaranteed to make women disrespect you and lose attraction to you. That way, you can cut them out of your life once and for all. So let's get into it. At the beginning of this interaction, things are pretty good between them. And you can watch the way that they interrupt each other. It's friendly. Kids are trying to go to bed. This was an early one. He interrupts, gets back to her. I had to sneak out. Interrupts. I go, mommy has to go to work. And they're like, oh, OK. No, then the baby wanted to come to you. There's no hard feelings here, though. Watch how that shifts in this next question, though. Or listen for, rather, the tone that Alec takes when he talks about Hilaria's age here. Pierre, were you? The last one to open, how old were you? Six? You were six years old when the first planet Hollywood opened. So she's shut down. She's not feeling good. She smiles it off. In this moment, that is a tone of the little man. That's a superior. How old were you? Buh. How old were you? Six? If you speak to someone with that tone, it's reasonable that they're going to feel like, why are you coming at me? This sets off everything that goes on after this. So right here, Alec interrupts. She then gives him 30, 40 seconds to talk. And quite frankly, he just fills up space. He says almost nothing. He drops some names. He repeats himself a couple times. And you can tell that while she's listening, she is no longer respecting his answer. Long time. House of Blues, too. Danny Aykroyd and that crowd. OK. And they were very, very famous restaurant music clubs. Played a lot of music. But now they went down. They closed. And they're reopening. She's bothered. That's a lip lick. You're going to see a lot of these. The original founder, the original guy that started it, is back here starting it again. So good for him. And that's the History Channel. So much right there. Let's slow this down. That's the History Channel. Obviously, that is a passive aggressive dig. And that's the History Channel as a way of saying, that was boring. Don't do that anymore. Look what Alec does as soon as she says that. This is the first huge problem. And that's the History Channel. He mumbles, I'm sorry. And by the way, if you can read lips, I'd love to know what he says after this. But the part that I can definitely read is, I'm sorry. Do not say sorry in order to make someone else stop being mad at you. Just because someone is bothered with you does not mean that it is appropriate for you to say sorry. You should say sorry when you feel that you've acted out of line with your own values, when you wish that you hadn't done something that you'd done for your own internal reasons. But what nice guys do, they use the word sorry to try to get out of trouble when the other person is upset with them. If they think that that person is overreacting with their anger towards them, they'll just say sorry to escape it. I'm sorry. And watch what happens here. Here, she is feeling like she doesn't trust him answering for her. She, as a mother, is very good at keeping them on a routine. But do you feel that? Open your mouth. She wants to say something. She's not doing it. She doesn't trust him. I have to say that every, I don't think you make it more silly than it is. I actually feel, I feel. I disagree. She's not happy with the way that he is handling this question. And honestly, she is now opposing him from what has happened before. I actually feel, I feel. No. No, we just cut all that part out. Cut me out. Cut you out. This is the other part. The cutting out, this is not just about the show. This is more passive aggressive of like, I need to cut you out right now. Watch how this transpires. No, I mean, I think that every day, because we like routine, and I think anybody who's a parent knows that routine is king or queen. Routine is key, which is king and queen at the same time. It's essential. It's essential. So he says this is essential. Watch how long it is before this interruption. He's clearly not listening anymore. He's needing something back from her. We'll talk about exactly what that is. I think that us trying to, every day. What's the word for essential in Spanish? Esencial. OK. That's rough. Don't let me down. Yeah. Don't let me down. Oh my god, you're distracting me right now. Sorry. Like, now you're just doing that. Another I'm sorry. Why are you distracting me? I'm just captivating the way you're doing it. Yeah, you're just distracting me. For nice guys, approval is like oxygen. The primary source of their approval over the course of their life tends to be women. But it starts with seeking approval from the mother, transfers, and is projected onto future romantic interests, dates, girlfriends, wives, that sort of thing. And so when the approval stopped flowing just a minute earlier, he started feeling unwell, dysregulated. So now he's just going to try all bunch of strategies. He's going to help her out. He's going to ask her about Spanish. Whether or not he's poking her here isn't totally clear. You're going to see him cycle through all different kinds of nice guy behaviors. But this interruption is a very child-like strategy to try to get attention and approval back to him. She now is upset with it. And she's going to shift into aggressive aggression, or active aggression, where she is no longer just like saying, ha-ha, history challenge. She's going to say, stop doing what you're doing. It's not cute. You're just distracting me. No, but, oh my god, stop. You're annoying me, stop. It's not cute. No, he's distracting me. So beautiful. So much going on here. OK, essentially what nice guy is, it is a childhood manipulation strategy because you need mom's approval. You're frustrated with mom. So the way that you act out is covert and passive aggressive. You're just distracting me. No, but, oh my god, stop. To compliment someone when you've just bothered them with an insincere compliment, what are you doing? Why are you interrupting me? It's because you're so beautiful. No, it's not. It is obviously not because she's beautiful. Something else is going on in him. If you look at it a very surface way, what the internet did, everyone then came and yelled at her. What the nice guy is very effective at doing through the duration of his life is if there's a room, there will often be conflict that erupts in the room that the nice guy is him. But the person who looks bad will not be that person. It will be someone else who has had it up to here with the manipulative, covert crap. And they'll go active in their aggression. And to someone who isn't attuned or doesn't know the details or the back story, it's going to look like that person just erupted. Oh my god, stop. You're annoying me. Stop. It's not cute. No, he's distracting me. The nice guy is so afraid to be perceived of as bad, they're focused primarily on looking good. Hence the compliments, hence everything. And the biggest thing that happens here looks at the camera. We're going to see a lot of this. Nice guys triangulate a third person into the relationship because they don't feel safe to stand up for themselves on their own. So they try to get a majority of people. And you're going to see them do it multiple times. Looks at the camera. Looks at the reporter like, oh, you know. Walk out of this interview. I need the motherhood notes. You are doing amazing. So then he wanders off. No. OK. Go back. Let me go back. OK, so she collects herself. It's all about routine. She's answering questions here. He's just lost. He hasn't gotten the approval. He needs to go somewhere. He's dysregulated. OK, so now another strategy. Similar, he's going to say how much he wants to come home. He needs to come home. He loves it. He loves his wife. He is needing that reflected approval. When you've bothered someone going up and kissing their butt over and over and over again from an ungrounded place, especially in this nice guy scenario where you're going to attract someone who generally doesn't go for that, it's not going to work. It's not going to get him the approval that he wants. He is sharing, most likely, this anecdote to try to get back in Hergard Grace's. And you'll see him do this. He tries at the end of this. She's not having it. Now, seriously, I have a home. Loves home. Home. I have a home. Loves his home. And when I'm not home, I want to go home. I just went to Florida overnight for an event in Palm Beach. She's got this lip lick. I flew down there yesterday, came back today. She's frustrated. Even when I'm away from them for a day, and you believe me when I say this, she loves when I go away. Why would you have to say, you believe me? And you believe me when I say this? It's because you're not speaking from your grounded self. You're not just saying what is true for you. He is trying to get her to believe him, that he really wants to be home. It's this little kid survival strategy of needing your approval to survive. I mean, it comes out directly here. You believe me when I say this? She loves when I go away. She loves it. Wow. Wow. And then she won't do it. Another thing that nice guys tend to do is they put people on the spot in difficult situations where they are stuck between this choice of publicly being like, stop doing what you're doing. I don't like that, which was her choice, or creating awkwardness. She's like, you like when I go away. You believe me. She loves when I go away. And the implication is you got to say, no, I want you to stay. I want you to stay. They seek that validation. And it is very annoying and frustrating to be around somebody who is getting validation not by saying, hey, I'm feeling insecure. Could you help me? They're seeking it in these manipulative, controlling ways to put you between a rock and a social hard place where you look like a jerk if you don't say it. We want more of this. Season two, do we know anything? The Hilaria Show. OK, so we're skipping ahead a little bit here. He's going to make this joke twice. So he tried being complimentary. It didn't work. And now he's going to cycle back to passive aggressive. The resentment is building in him. This is one of the core traits of nice guys is they are filled with resentment. And to the degree that you have this, I have definitely had this in my life. You will build resentment and frustration over time because the strategy doesn't work and it's emasculating. Season two, do we know anything? The Hilaria Show. So the Hilaria Show, like what is going to happen in season two, implying that it's going to be all about her. And he'll make the same joke even more pointed later. No, no, I think we're going to see, you know, we're going to see how it feels to have it be out there. It's going to be great. You're a winner. Oh my god, when I'm talking, you're not talking. No, when I'm talking, you're not talking. This is a direct, passive, aggressive attack from him. It's going to be great. You're a winner. You're a winner. He's so angry at her when he is saying that. She brings the aggressive, active aggression. She says, stop doing this. He's cowed. He looks down. I'm talking, you're not talking. This is why, yes. He looks at the camera and he does the thing where he brings in, he triangulates a third party. If you find yourself having to triangulate a third party and you're going, she said that I was right. And I told her what happened and she said that I was right. So I don't know why you're being upset with me. That's a sign that you're in a toxic relationship. A healthy relationship is one where two people trust one another enough to take responsibility when they've made a mistake. They can say, hey, I think you mistreated me there and trust that the other person has the maturity to reflect and say, you're right. Or, you know, I actually think that something was going on with you and you were projecting on me. Or, you know, you don't have to use all the therapeutic language. But to say, to divvy up responsibility in a way that feels good for both people. If you don't trust your partner to do that, you're naturally going to try to seek majorities outside of the relationship to come and weigh in and overpower the other person, which is what that look at the camera is. He's looking to the cameraman, trying to rope other people in. And honestly, that is what happened here. The internet definitely got mad at her compared to him. Got him out of the show. She cuts him out. I mean, I think this is a really raw show. And now he feels like crap. He's angry, angry now. He tried being nice. He tried being passive aggressive. And, you know, I think that it's... Walking away. Okay, so she's gonna bring him back in a little bit later. Because you guys saw an episode too. Carmen and her face masks. When you are affectionate or with someone in the middle of an unresolved fight is a way of like controlling them, or it can at least be perceived as that. You might not mean it to come across, but being really huggy and affectionate and, oh, I love you so much, that is a smothering move. And it doesn't feel good. He doesn't like it here. And then watch his response, because he's going to come with the most aggression that we see from him. For episodes, I predict now on television, on American television, that season two is going to be you and Carmen. It's going to be the two of them. They have their own show. Can I tell you, from now on... He's pissed. He's saying, you don't let me be involved, but he's completely passive about it. Instead of saying, I wish you'd let me talk more, or like, you keep cutting me off. I don't appreciate that. You don't seem to value the things that I have to say. It's not happening. And because he's not bringing this stuff actively, she is even disrespecting him more and more and more. Can I tell you, from now on, unless it's history, don't take anything that this guy is going to say, because he just invents it. Let's fuck. It's all like this. That's how she feels about him. She's telling other people don't take it, but she's saying, this is how I feel. I don't take anything that he says. He just invents it. I can't trust him. So now he's come back, and now we're back to the compliment. Well, people read my wife's book and realize what an unusually amazing woman she is. So it starts off with a nice compliment. My wife is probably one of the most special people. She is. Probably the most special person I've ever met in my life. Her qualities are just so... The combinations are kind of mind-blowing. Anyway. And she doesn't receive it, and so he can't stick with it. There's no depth to that compliment. It may be true for him in other times, but be careful. If you find yourself in the middle of fights wanting to say things like, I love you, I appreciate you, or every time you bring up something that is challenging for the other person, something you'd like to have them change, you have to compliment sandwich it. That is a symptom of nice guy stuff. It means that you can't bring out a pure expression of something is bothering me without feeling that you have to buffer it. And usually that's because earlier in your life, you shared that something was hard with a primary caretaker and they emotionally stepped away from you. They made it your fault. They blamed you. They walked away. And so you're always on thin ice around people, which is why you don't bring conflict up clearly and actively, and then allow that conflict to sit. Nice guys, while they can be very consistent with their resentment, they can only sit in it for a little bit at a time. They never get deep into the actual anger because they don't trust that the relationship can withstand that. I really quickly just wanna highlight some of the things, the key takeaways that I've written down here. First, cut out any reflexive sorries. Only say sorry when you mean it, when you feel genuine remorse. Second, pay attention to your own passive aggressiveness. If you're wanting something, when you find yourself making a passive aggressive joke, look inside and saying, what is it that I'm wanting to receive or wanting to stop? And speak the sentence that starts with I'd like, and that's it. I'd like you to not interrupt me the next time I speak. Do not compliment women or anyone to get out of the doghouse. Do not chase someone if you sense that they're angry with you. Do not make that the sole reason that you're chasing to try to make them feel better. It is okay for people in loving relationships to be upset with one another, to step away from one another. One of the most common pieces of advice that I disagree with is never go to sleep angry. I disagree. I think it is totally healthy to have a relationship that can permit anger that lasts through the evening, right? You can go to bed knowing that you can wake up and resolve it. It doesn't have to be immediately resolved between you. That means that the things that you're resolving are small. You're not getting into the larger issues that might take more time and space to resolve. Pay attention. If the woman that you're with does not respect you when you're answering questions, she doesn't trust you and reflect. Is there something that you could learn from it? Being like, wow, I do ramble a lot and I could see that we're promoting a television show and that might not be good for it. Or ask yourself, holy cow, do I wanna be with someone that does not trust and respect me to handle it when I'm talking? And if you're doing this to the woman that you're with, you can't trust her when she's in public to answer for herself. Notice that there's a problem there. Also, do not try to win in arguments by inviting in outside parties. It's totally fine to seek advice, to vent to friends, to do all of that. If you're going back to your spouse or the person that you're dating and saying, you know, I told so-and-so about it and they agreed with me, now you're trying to gang up and form majorities, that's not what a relationship is. It's two people and you have to work that out with one another. And if you find that some of these nice guys tendencies are in your life, that's extremely normal, but there is a way to get over them outside of this video. I would highly recommend checking out Charisma University. It is the program that I made and I've recorded it four times. The first time had way more people pleasing nice guy tendencies in it. And I recently went through it just to check and I am happy to say, and I was genuinely proud to go through it and see that, oh, wow, I've leaned a lot of this up. There's ways to attract people, feel confident, make situations go well without resorting to people pleasing. So if you wanna improve these tendencies in your life, you wanna be more confident and charismatic in any social situation, check out Charisma University. I hope that you guys have enjoyed this video. If you liked it, let me know and I'll see you in the next one, peace.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 948}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've all had those moments where we wish we could think of something funny to say but our mind goes blank. It can be frustrating especially when you're talking to someone you really want to like you. So in today's video, we'll go through six easy ways you can make people laugh or just love being around you. The first trick is to finish someone's incomplete sentence with a joke. Here's a quick example with Chris Evans. How many times a week do people come up to you guys and just say, I love Star Trek. It's like, yes, not me. Cutting someone off to genuinely finish their sentence for them can be annoying but by doing it with a joke, you make them laugh and instantly create a more playful vibe. And as you'll see in this next clip, it's easier for them to retake the conversation so they can finish their thought. You spent a long time obviously chasing a career in Hollywood and then when you finally got there, it feels as though you've been very quick to not run home but just... You kind of had it in your hands and you chucked it away. You spend a lot of time at home. The key to getting a big laugh is to finish their sentence with something ridiculous. Make it something they clearly weren't going to say. Here's one last funny example. You bring these slightly different nuances to Thor, whether he's on Asgard or on Earth or whatever. You bring new aspects to him and with Captain America, it's like, as we've seen him... He doesn't bring new ones. Yes! The only downside with this joke is that you have to think pretty quickly. You need to come up with something funny before they finish their sentence. If that seems daunting, you can start by practicing being witty in a different situation — one where you have plenty of time to think of what to say. When you're asked a question, most people answer every question literally, which can get boring. Instead, look at questions as opportunities to make people laugh, like Chris Hemsworth at the end of this next clip. Most likely to grow a beard and disappear for a while, a la Cap. Probably me. Evans. Yeah, I think it is Evans. I think Hemsworth. Scarlett Johansson. It's that easy. If you want to consistently make people laugh, surprise them with unexpected absurd answers. Here's another example, this time from Chris Pratt. This is a two-part clip. First, listen to him set the scene by talking about shooting underwater for Jurassic World. A minute later, Chris is asked if he would pee in the water. Most people here would simply answer yes or no, but watch what Chris does instead. With my eyes open, of course, as if I could see with my eyes open underwater. Chris, did you pee? I actually shit myself. You can also use unexpected absurdity when you're the one asking questions. For context for this next clip, Margot Robbie is Australian. If you could have lunch with any celebrity, living or dead, would you take them to Outback Steakhouse? Now, let's say that you forget to give an absurd answer. You default to your old habit of answering literally and then realize, oh shoot, this was my chance to make them laugh. In that case, you can start with a real answer and then pivot to an exaggerated version of that real answer. For a quick example, watch Chris Evans in this next clip. Stealing movie set props is totally normal. Three, two, one. Yeah, you know, I'm into that. Come on. Yeah, I'm just into theft in general. Yeah, me too. Stealing is fine. It doesn't matter who owns things, you know? You saw there one of the advantages of doing this playful pivot. It encouraged Taika to be playful as well. You'd be surprised at how a few little jokes like this early in an interaction can completely change how well you connect with someone. Here's one more quick example of this playful pivot, this time with Chris Hemsworth. Most of you have kids. Is this up to the cool factor? I was just telling the guys one of my kids thinks that I'm cool. Just one? Yeah, just one. And he gets fed the most, he gets looked after, he gets loved. The other ones like Wonder Woman so they sleep outside. Beyond jokes, a lot of the time when someone reflects on feeling boring or awkward in conversation, they often say, I couldn't think of anything to say. What that's really code for is I had thoughts in my head but I judged them as not good enough to share. So a key habit you want to learn is to lower your filter. Specifically, start saying your positive thoughts out loud. We often take for granted that people know we like them but saying it out loud can have a very positive impact on your relationship. Well, it's like hanging out with Jeff Goldblum and no hyperbole, it's the best time you'll ever have. She exudes a sort of — you just — you feel like, yeah, this woman belongs here. She belongs here. She fits right in and it's gonna — you know, she doesn't need any advice from me. You may not think this works outside of people you know well but you can even do this the first time you meet someone. If you're talking to someone you've just met and your mind goes blank, you can use a complimentary cold read to keep the conversation flowing. That means you say something nice and follow it with a guess about the person you're talking to. By saying something like, you're so charismatic, I bet you're an actor or that's a really well-trained dog. Are you a dog trainer? You'll make the person feel good and are very likely to start a new branch of conversation. If complimenting other people isn't something you're comfortable with, you can also be charming by simply being positive about your own life, especially if you can be relentlessly positive, meaning you can be positive about things other people would normally be negative about. Here's a great example from Chris Pratt where Ellen is giving him a hard time about living in a van and taking low-paying jobs before his career took off. Chris is ignoring her negative tone and staying relentlessly positive and it makes him very likable in that moment. He does this again a minute later taking something most people would view as negative and reframing it to be positive. If this isn't naturally how your mind works, that's okay. While it may take some time, you can absolutely make positivity an unthinking habit. One exercise that can help you is when you find yourself in a negative mindset, ask yourself, If I had to say something positive about this situation, what would I say? You can do it in the moment or you can make it a nightly journal exercise. Once you have this kind of positive energy, people will love being around you. Ironically, another great way to get there is to stop focusing on making other people like you and instead focus on having fun. Chris Pratt loves to dance on set and crash his co-stars' interviews, Chris Hemsworth is often seen being goopy with his daughters, and Chris Evans loves pranking people. Rather than orienting towards trying to look cool, they all seem to orient towards having fun and making things fun for the people around them. And at the end of the day, we like being around people that make us feel good. The best part is all that takes is the confidence to look silly, stop worrying about what other people think, and just have a good time. Ironically, while knowing that those habits will make people want to connect with you as a friend, co-worker, or date. Now, you might think building that kind of confidence will take you a long time or maybe you even think it's impossible for you that you could never actually put this stuff into practice. But building confidence and charisma is way easier than you think. With the right game plan, you can do it in just a few weeks. If you want the fastest way I know to take your confidence and charisma to the next level, check out our program Charisma University. Rather than me telling you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. This first one is a comment in the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their social and dating life. He says, Life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event that I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. This next one comes from someone who had just started a new job. They say, I wanted to let you know that I nailed those first few days at work. Everything that I needed was right there at the moment I needed it. The confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset. And with all your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it just could not go wrong. And this last one comes from an officer in the army. They say, I used to come off overly serious and reserved, which got in the way of connecting with new people. Since taking the course, I have way more confidence to just go out and strike up a conversation with random people. It's also helped me handle body language and physical contact a lot smoother. And in general, I notice people are smiling way more when I'm around. Thank you for making it. I'm glad I joined. If you do join Charisma University, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is 100% for any reason at all. We make it 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because we want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting a ton of value from the course. If you want to check the course out, click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this program and get a ton out of it and we'd love for you to do the same.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"The most underrated social skill is so invisible that it looks like nothing and it is so uncommon that I've made hundreds of videos on this channel and I haven't covered it yet and it's mostly about what you do not do. Here it is. We don't have to talk, man. I can just sit here with you for a minute. When people are having a hard time, they're usually met with well-meaning interruptions like, you'll get through this, just remember how strong you are but what is needed most in those moments is not fixing, advising, or encouraging but the strength and presence to simply hold space. And in this video, I want to talk to you about how you can use the skill of holding space to become adored for your quiet presence and appreciated by everyone you choose to share this gift with. For context, Sean Strickland is opening up to Theo Vaughn about his childhood abuse but notice in this next clip how his emotions seem disconnected from the story he's telling. I'll never forget, you know, I always tell people the first day I trained, I got the sh-t kicked out of me, covered in blood, bro, like, first moment in my life I ever felt happiness. I'd sleep under the bed, you know, I'd sleep by the door because I thought my dad was gonna kill my mom so, like, just laying underneath the bed like as they're fighting because I think my dad's gonna kill my mom. Wow, he was that violent? Yeah, he's just a coward, you know? You'll see this in your own life when people tell emotionally charged stories with a flat affect. This is often a sign that they are dissociating. The experience is so painful that they haven't fully let themselves feel it but they're telling it because it is seeking to be heard and if you stay with it, oftentimes, the underlying emotion will break through. Dude, I remember, like, laying in bed. Like, I remember I stopped believing in God, man, like, like, I have, um, yeah, it's crazy, dude. Crazy sh-t, man. These moments, admittedly, can be jarring and to be clear, you are under no obligation to hold space for someone that you don't feel comfortable with but if you do want to offer support, the first step is to switch conversational modes. You see, most of the time, we are in relating mode. You crack a joke, I elaborate on it. You tell a story, I tell a story of my own. This channel is mostly about that relating mode and Theo is clearly still in it here. It's okay, man. It's a lot of that sad, dude. I used to be scared at night, like, uh, I used to stand up like I heard when I was a kid that, like, if you peed around your, like, animals could pee somewhere that other animals wouldn't come. You know what I'm talking about? You know what I'm talking about? Huh? Have you ever heard that? It's clear that Sean is still in the pain of his memories and this is where you can move to the mode of holding space. That is, shifting out of the you-go-I-go mode into one of sitting patiently in a non-judgmental present state. When you're holding space, you're listening to another person without an agenda to fix them, change them, or even make them feel better. Yeah, I'm sorry, bud. So, ah, man. I'm sorry, buddy. It's all good, dude. This is hard. We see someone that we care about and it is natural to be triggered into offering advice or telling them that it's not their fault but all of this can take people out of their experience and stop them from sharing the vulnerable thing that they're about to share. It can make them feel like there's something wrong with them for not being okay. In fact, people are so used to being rescued in these moments that they'll often reflexively say that they're fine just to avoid the other person trying to make them fine. I'm sorry, buddy. It's all good, dude. This is a defense mechanism to weed out those who can and can't hold space for the enormity of what they're experiencing. You don't need to respond here. Just listen and gently affirm that you're open to sitting with them. I'm just going to let this next section play out because Theo's handling of this is beautiful and because his silence is the gift. See if you can just feel it. We don't have to talk, man. I can just sit here with you for a minute. Take a sec. I can just sit here. We can just sit here. Nah, it's all good, dude. Take a sec. I'll just process it. I think it's a little hard things that people don't understand like trauma, you know? Yeah. Now, there's a real subtlety of when and how to speak in these situations because holding space isn't about sitting there and being mute. It's about whether you're trying to escape the discomfort of the situation or if you're down to just be in it without taking on the other person's burden. We've seen what are called empathetic interruptions from Theo that have this quality of willingness to just be in it and you can see that Sean responds by feeling more each time. We don't have to talk, man. I can just sit here with you for a minute. That makes me sad. Yeah, dude. No, it just makes me sad that a kid has to feel that way, you know? Yeah, so like... Any kid. Whenever Drikus goes on there and like he jokes about that, right? It's like, dude, you have no idea. But there's also interruptions where Theo begins speaking for Sean or speaking from his own discomfort. Absolutely no shade here to Theo because he handled the situation incredibly well but I want to show you these so that you can see how well-attuned someone in this state is to the quality of your presence and you can see how even just a little bit of less than empathetic interruption to that presence can cause them to enter into their defensive patterns. Like, I remember I have a hole in my gum. Yeah, when I was a kid, I used to scratch my gum and I have a hole in my gum. You know, I'm... Just from being nervous and stuff? No, just anxiety, you know? Yeah. Yeah, even to this day. Yeah. I mean, today, dude, like, I'm a grown-ass man. I don't give a ****. I mean, you could post this. I don't care. Oh, dude, I don't have any... No, it's all good. Switch modes, gently offer to listen, and interrupt only from a place of presence. It's simple but not easy. And the incredible power of holding space in this way is why good therapists make so much money and why a friend who can offer this is worth their weight in gold. Now, if you're interested in mastering those other two modes relating and sharing so that your social confidence goes through the roof, you may want to join Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program that tells you exactly what to do every day so that 30 days from now, you radiate confidence and charisma naturally without even thinking about it.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Why does anyone spend money on OnlyFans in a world where X-rated content is free? I asked myself that question the other day and quickly concluded that people were just being stupid and I moved on. But of course, that's not the case. I've learned that whenever I think that masses of people are stupid, I'm the one who's being stupid. I just don't understand them. But if I did, I could learn something important about the real world and what truly drives human psychology. So with credit card in hand, I signed up for an OnlyFans investigation and what I found surprised me not only for what it said about human psychology, but also the direction that consumerism is taking all of us. But before we get there, we need to cover exactly what OnlyFans is. Essentially, OnlyFans allows anyone to put a paywall on their content. You can set up a monthly subscription fee and have the option for one-off upsells to easily monetize photos, video, audio, or just the chance to message you directly. OnlyFans has some fitness trainers and some musicians on the platform, but really, they specialize in X-rated content. Same story with their co-owned sister site, MyFreeCams, which offers live X-rated webcam chat rooms. On both platforms, the dominant business model is men paying women for racy messages, photos, and video, which is where the question that started this whole video arose — why do these men pay when free pornography has been available on the web since 56k dial-up connections? The surprising answer comes in three parts. First, OnlyFans has nailed the dopamine hooks of social media sites and casinos that pornography has not fully exploited on the web. You see, the very structure of OnlyFans is gated silos. When you log into a creator's page, you can see the number of posts they have, but no details about those posts. Once you're a subscriber, you can see the posts, but some of them are blurred out behind a locked paywall. The only thing that you can see is a provocative text description. Of course, though, you can pay to unlock those. If you want to go deeper into the gated community, you can order custom videos, but you'll have to send extra tip money to get those made for you. The constant feeling that one has on OnlyFans is kind of like the one that you might get if your phone buzzed with a text or someone sent you a Snap video, but you couldn't open it. There's mystery. You're thinking about it, and that creates anticipation. You can contrast this with X-rated websites, where every mystery is immediately revealed. Want to know what's in a video? In seconds, you can read the explicit title, see an explicit thumbnail, and even hover over that thumbnail to see various moments in the scene. There's almost zero space in between desire and the fulfillment of that desire. With OnlyFans, though, your imagination has to work. You focus on the hints at each level of gated content, wondering what exactly is on the other side, and when you focus longer on something, you tend to value it more. That's partially why digital slot machines still show the real stopping one by one. That extra time builds anticipation and investment in the game. Now, the dopamine hacks are even more aggressive on the live cam sister sites that incorporate other staples of the gambling industry straight from it. There are kino boards in the chat where buying the winning number can get you a sexy dance or something of that nature instead of gambling winnings. There's roulette wheels with different racy activities for your preferred cam girl to act out. And if you donate enough tips on censored OnlyFan posts, that will make the creator show the uncensored version. The unclear amount required, though, to win is reminiscent of those coin games in Chuckie Cheese where the next coin could be the one that tipped the whole game. Again, the prize in all of these cases is similar to what's available on every other pornography website. But the mystery in anticipation drives seemingly irrational behavior. Family Guy understood this years ago. Not so fast, Lois. A boat's a boat, but the mystery box could be anything. It could even be a boat! But the mystery box isn't the only thing that has made OnlyFans so successful. Our second point is where OnlyFans starts to really distinguish itself. Take the top creator, Jem Wolfie. Her Instagram page is pretty darn explicit in several photos but what's missing here? You. On Instagram, Jem is often aloof. She doesn't always look at the camera. The audience is more like a voyeur that she doesn't recognize. But on OnlyFans, the audience is acknowledged. She and other creators will often send messages asking you to react if you like the recent shots. And at the time of writing this, in her last 10 Instagram posts, Jem has commented the word you or you're only twice. But with OnlyFans, those words appear in 8 of the last 10 posts. This recognition becomes something like intimacy when creators send good morning or good night texts claiming to be thinking of you. One creator sent me a message complaining about being bored asking me slash all of us to write messages to give her something to do. And I'll tell you how I responded in the next point but the point for now is that the relationship on OnlyFans begins to mimic a friendship or a long-distance relationship at least in its cadence. In fact, active members of live cam chat rooms often form friend groups. They recognize one another when they came in which was shocking to me. They'll check in with one another to see how the big work project went or where they've been if they haven't showed up in a while. If the creator doesn't stream though, the fans can't hang with that friend group on that day. So aspects of intimate relationships and friendships are offered via OnlyFans but really, it's this last piece that makes OnlyFans potentially more addictive even than casinos because on OnlyFans, you can purchase guaranteed acceptance. I told you earlier that I responded to that creator who said that she was bored and I had a hunch that acceptance was a huge piece of the OnlyFans psychology puzzle. So I purposely wrote back the most lame, boring message I could think of just to see if I could get her to reject or ignore me. This is a message that if you sent on a dating app like Tinder or Bumble would get you left on read because it's just totally uninteresting. It's the type of thing that so many guys text and it's very boring for someone who gets a lot of messages like this to respond to. I said, Hey there, just doing some work this week, enjoying the sunshine, WBU, any plans? And what do you know? On OnlyFans, I didn't get left on read. She wrote back with a message containing two exclamation points and a smiley face emoji. That's without even tipping her which I suspect could have netted me half a dozen exclamation points. The point is on OnlyFans, I didn't need to make myself interesting to her. I didn't need to stand out from the crowd. She would remain interested even if I wasn't interesting. I saw the same dynamic in the hobbies of OnlyFans creators. On most dating apps, it's the exception to find a woman who emphasizes her love of basketball, golf, anime, or obscure philosophers. Of course, those women exist but those interests tend to be mainly held by men. On OnlyFans, the number of women highlighting predominantly male hobbies is through the roof. Beyond hobbies, I also saw stories of not fitting in in high school and feeling different from everyone else. Now, all of these creators may genuinely have these hobbies and backstories but their representation is far higher than that of the typical dating pool and I think the reason for this discrepancy is that men sometimes struggle to relate when speaking to a woman they're attracted to. They have to put an effort to make their hobbies relatable to someone who doesn't necessarily share them or step beyond their interests to talk to someone who doesn't love all the same activities, entertainment, and conversational topics but OnlyFans shortcuts this discomfort. Not only will your dream girl send you naked photos, she'll also do the more important work of carrying the conversation, of finding ways to make relating easy. You don't need to feel uncomfortable or at a loss for words or rejected if she doesn't reply. For a fee, that's all gone. One creator told me that a popular tip mechanic she has is to offer to rate guys dick pics on a scale of 1 to 10 and she said that some men who have been insecure about their penis and received a low score actually feel relieved because even if she gives them a low score, they're still part of the group. She'll still answer their messages enthusiastically, still be excited to see their name pop up in the chat, still send them videos of her saying their name sexually if they send the right tip amount and think how intoxicating that must feel to reveal your biggest insecurity to someone that you're wildly attracted to and for them to see that insecurity, tell you the truth about it, and then not have that insecurity impact your relationship. That is not always the case outside of OnlyFans. We often have insecurities precisely because at some point, we were rejected for some aspect of our body, personality, or our history. It's one of the most gut-wrenching feelings and one most people avoid at all costs. So why does OnlyFans exist in a world with lots of pornography? Because if porn offers arousal and orgasm, OnlyFans offers connection without the fear of frustration or rejection. The difficulty of getting into and maintaining a relationship can be bypassed, at least, in part. For a price, you get a sex-obsessed long-distance girlfriend without having to offer her anything in return but money. You don't have to interest her, relate to her, or help her through any of her difficulties unless, of course, that's your thing. In a way, OnlyFans is a direct competitor to personal development resources including this channel because you no longer have to change your habits to get different results in your social or romantic life. Now, I should pause and say that OnlyFans doesn't totally replace relationships for all of its subscribers. Several creators told me that they have followers with girlfriends or wives. For those men, they said they offered an escape but I think that it's a similar escape to the men who are not in a relationship but are also subscribed. In both cases, you leave behind the obligations and pressures of dealing with another potentially difficult human being. My personal take is that this isn't great for the customer. If you bypass the challenges of relating to other people, you deprive yourself of life's major catalyst for personal growth. Instead of building hard-won character traits that can last a lifetime, you rely on cash to maintain relationships that are comfortable and pleasing to you. So my humble recommendation is to avoid paying for connection, risk rejection to develop the skills and the character traits that make you someone people want to be around, and someone that can handle the problems that arise when other people aren't being paid to be friendly. It's certainly slower and more difficult but I believe that it's ultimately more rewarding. And you can save your money for somewhere that it can go a lot farther. I'm talking about simping for charity. You see, we've partnered with Charity Water to get clean water to 10,000 people who don't have it. We are nearly halfway there but, quite frankly, I need the help of this community to make it happen. If you choose to donate using the link below, even a small amount, the people that you are helping are people who may get diseases from dirty water or who have to walk hours a day just to get a few gallons and try to avoid that fate for one more day. And what's crazy is that for the price of unlocking some OnlyFans photos, you, personally, can give someone clean water for 10 years. That is $40 to get someone clean water for a decade. We've worked with Charity Water in the past and thanks to your generous donations, we've already built several wells where entire communities get water every single day. And just so you know, every single dollar that you donate through the link below goes directly to the field so it's being used as efficiently as possible. So I hope that you click the link and, again, join me in simping for charity. It might be something that you decide on a whim right now but it is no exaggeration to say that that choice can literally save someone's life. And if you're on the edge, I will match whatever you donate until we hit those 10,000 people so your giving goes twice as far today. So click the link on the screen to donate. I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 700}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Why does anyone confess to the police? While a plea bargain in court might lower your punishment, confessing to police can only hurt you. Yet, people do it all the time. What did you do? I killed Bridget Harrison and killed Harrison. Guilty or wrongfully accused, an officer's first step in an interrogation is to pretend they're your ally. So, before mentioning anything about the case, police will try to build rapport by bringing you something to drink or bonding over commonalities. The goal is to make you feel relaxed and unthreatened. Watch this next clip. You would never guess from his behavior that the detective already has hard evidence that the guy in front of him is a murderer. I'm a big coffee guy. I don't know if you're a coffee guy or not, but I didn't want to drink in front of you, so... No, I appreciate that. Alright, go ahead. Russell, just to avoid any confusion, because people do get confused when they're talked to by the police, is that you're obviously not under arrest here today, okay? Anytime you feel you want to leave here, you feel free to do so. The door's not locked. The police will walk you down the lobby anytime you want, okay? Once they've built rapport with you, the next step is what police call a positive confrontation. They tell you they already know you're guilty and they just want to know why you did it. This is where things get interesting. Whether it's true or not, interrogators will tell you they have so much evidence that your guilt isn't in doubt. This can involve legally lying to you about fake witnesses, fingerprints, DNA, or video footage. In this next clip, an officer tries to get a confession from an innocent man. Notice the confusion and doubt that starts to creep in when he's faced with false evidence. There's a number of witnesses. Ooh, great. One of whom had a video camera. Perfect. Yeah, yeah. So view the video camera. I have. Okay. That's why your guilt isn't an issue here. That doesn't even make sense to me. Because if I'm on the video camera... While faking evidence is extremely effective at getting guilty people to confess, it can unfortunately result in innocent people confessing as well. One of the more heartbreaking examples of this is Marty Tankleff. At 17 years old, Marty woke up and found his mother stabbed to death and his father bleeding and unconscious. Marty called 911. After bringing him in as a suspect and interrogating him for hours without success, an officer lied to Marty that his father had woken up and identified him as the attacker. Marty knew he was innocent, but didn't realize that police can lie during an interrogation. So suddenly, he started to doubt himself thinking maybe he did it while in a blackout. Marty then gave a false confession that he immediately took back saying he was coerced while in a state of shock. But that confession led to his conviction and he spent 17 years in prison before being deemed innocent and set free. Part of the reason these positive confrontations are so effective is because the police are trained to speak with complete certainty when presenting the evidence to you. In this next clip, police are looking for a missing woman. They're interrogating a co-worker who claimed he hadn't seen her the day she disappeared. Listen to how the officer's tone conveys no doubt about whether or not the missing woman was caught on camera in this guy's car. Okay, well tell us when you left with her in the car because that is what is shown. We can't make up that. We can't falsify video camera-ly. I'm not lying to you because you know I'm telling the truth because you know that's what's on the video. Now, in this case, the video camera was real but they had no way of proving the missing girl got into his car just a car that looked like it might be his. Yet, because the detective says it with such conviction, he confesses that he's been lying to police and admits he was the last person seen with the missing woman. Ultimately, this led to him confessing to police that he murdered her. Because this confrontation with evidence is often the first time you'll realize you're a serious suspect, it's very common for people to push back and deny their guilt. This psychological trick comes into play. Police interrogators shut down denials immediately before you can even state them. This pattern interrupt makes sure you don't build up confidence in your ability to stand up for yourself. Here's a quick example. We can prove that. We're beyond that point, buddy. We're beyond that, man. The goal is to create the feeling that there's nothing you can do to convince them you're completely innocent. Here's another example. I don't know how much I can tell you right now. It's not even an option right now. You did not pass the polygraph, so I know you were being deceptive. That's not even an issue right now. The issue right now is what happened to Shanann, Bella and Celeste. Now that you're feeling trapped, beaten down and hopeless, the next step is to give you a way out of this mess with minimization. The goal here is to get you to confess by minimizing the perceived evil of the crime. One way to do this is to say that you did what anyone would have done in your situation. Watch Officer George Birch explain how this alone can get a confession. I had a sexual assault case. I had to talk to the guy how hot the woman was and I understand where he was coming from. And when I said that, we were buds and he started talking to me. And he's still sitting in prison. Another trick is to let you think there's a chance you can shape the story that gets out. The questions you're about to see are what finally convince this man to confess to murder. When stuff gets out that you guys left and all that together and all that stuff, do you want people to remember you as a guy who said, okay, look, I'm gonna do the right thing? Or do you want your family and everybody else to think that you're some evil, heartless person who won't tell us where she is? Please tell me where to go find her. That's how people will remember you. During this minimization process, police will often use what they call alternative questions. Basically, they'll present you with a story where you're guilty of the crime but in a way that's more sympathetic or justifiable. Returning to the case of Chris Watts, his wife and two daughters are missing and he's already failed a lie detector. Watch how the interrogator first tries to minimize the crime as a mistake and then poses an alternative question to make Chris feel like he can confess without being the bad guy. We have no doubt you love these girls with all of your heart. I have no doubt. But we make mistakes. I did not do anything. I did not do anything. I did not do anything. What did she do? Tell us, Chris. Chicks are crazy. Can I talk to my dad or something? Chris desperately wants to get out of this interrogation and he latches onto the idea that he can lie and say his wife was hurting his kids. What did she tell him? Mary. Mary Blue. She told both of them that. I freaked out when she hit me. Just like that, the police have him confessing on tape for murder. You may think, this is actually smart of Chris because at least he's only getting convicted but in reality, his minimized confession hasn't done his case any favors because the police don't actually buy it. I did not hurt these girls. Are you okay with the public knowing that she did? Yeah, because I did not hurt these girls. Chris, I'm not sure I believe you. Minimizing a crime during an interrogation is very effective at getting the guilty to confess in hopes of a less harsh penalty. Unfortunately, it can also be effective on the innocent. Here's an example that isn't as clear cut as Chris Watts. This man says he's innocent. The police say he's guilty. He's being accused of shooting a police officer. After seven hours of telling the police he didn't do it and being told he's lying, you can imagine how this alternative story suddenly becomes appealing. It could have been a fucking accident. It could have been an accidental discharge. Okay, but when you don't, when you're completely denying that, then I gotta think another way, bro. Now we need to know if you tried to kill that deputy or did you just discharge the firearm Imagine that's you. The police have thrown a mountain of real or fake evidence against you, told you they're absolutely certain you're guilty, and shut you down instantly whenever you try to deny it. You feel like everything is stacked against you and fear you'll get wrongfully convicted for shooting a police officer. Then the interrogating officer tells you that confessing is your way out of this mess with as little penalty as possible. It's suddenly easy to understand why police are phenomenal at getting criminals to confess. Unfortunately, it's also easy to see why some innocent people falsely confess. If you want to learn more about false confessions and the dangers of talking to police even if you're innocent, I highly recommend you check out Professor James Duane's audiobook You Have the Right to Remain Innocent which you can get for free thanks to our sponsor for this video, Audible. It really hammers home why you should always get a lawyer if the police call you in for questioning. One of the lessons from Professor Duane is that even if you don't confess, police will try to get you on the record with seemingly harmless details so that they can potentially use them against you later. For example, he shares the story of a man who told police that an ex-girlfriend of his lived in a certain neighborhood and that piece of information, voluntarily shared, got him falsely imprisoned for 20 years for a rape it turned out he did not commit. You Have the Right to Remain Innocent has a number of incredible and shocking stories of people being imprisoned for a variety of small things they said or did while being interrogated. You can get it for free by going to audible.com slash charisma or texting charisma to 500-500. Audible is my favorite audiobook platform and something I personally use all the time. It's a great way to take time that's normally dead time, like doing errands around the house, and transform it into productive time where you're learning and improving yourself. By joining Audible, you get a credit every month to use on any title in their premium selection, regardless of price. You also get access to their Plus Catalog with thousands of titles you can listen to for free. Again, if you want to try it out, you can go to audible.com slash charisma or text charisma to 500-500 and get a free 30-day trial including any audiobook you want. One other quick note, a lot of the interrogations I studied to make this video seem to follow something called the read technique. If you want to watch the read technique being used in full-length interrogations, I recommend the YouTube channel JCS Criminal Psychology. Either way, I hope you liked this video. I want to thank our video editor, Therese, for working so hard to edit it.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Something is missing in modern men and without it, they are lost, aimless, and the statistics prove it. I'm someone who doesn't have a lot of friends. Unemployed, single, and living at home. You have record numbers of men in their 20s and 30s that are still living with their parents. You have fewer young men in relationships or having sex and a quarter of young men report that they have no close friends. Most men are single. Most young women are not. I'm recording this video because I'm lonely. Four times more likely to kill themselves, three times more likely to be addicted, 12 times more likely to be incarcerated. There are important economic and sociological factors behind this but from a psychological perspective, there is one major contributor for all of these issues— disconnection from the masculine archetypes. Now, you may not know what an archetype is so let me explain why these are so important. An archetype is the part of your psychology that already knows how to live your highest potential and each specific archetype unlocks a specific aspect of your highest potential. The king knows how to lead with deep conviction and power. The magician knows how to break through stuckness and create transformation and the lover knows how to love fully but most of us are disconnected from these archetypes and so we don't live up to our highest potentials. That's why we have always told myths and made art that remind us of these archetypes because those stories wake us up to the version of ourselves that already knows how to live with confidence, courage, and purpose. Now, I've already mentioned the first three masculine archetypes— the king, the magician, and the lover but it's the final masculine archetype that is the most discouraged by modern society and I believe that losing it has been a core cause of the epidemic of male aimlessness. That missing archetype is the warrior because it is the warrior that gives men their focus, their drive, and without it, they become weak and harmless in the worst way possible. Well, if you're harmless, you're not virtuous. You're just harmless. So I want to dive into four key aspects of the warrior that will wake that up inside of you so that you can retake control of your life. This is where we hold them. This is where we fight. First, the warrior loves his aggression and it's no secret that modern society does not know what to do with the aggression of boys and men. From a very young age, we talk about being able to sit quietly and regulate your emotions and not be aggressive and not be impulsive. The problem is that aggression can't simply just be turned off or pushed down. It needs to be channeled because aggression is the fuel that enables men to draw boundaries. When men are taught how to harness this power from a young age, they learn to assert themselves and defend their boundaries without violence or even needing to raise their voice and you can see that contained aggression here. Here's the thing, Peter. You're stepping over a line now. You're stepping over a line. You know you are. I suppose the question is that people want to know. Peter, you want to know. But if aggression is demonized and never given an opportunity to express itself, it gets turned inward and shows up as depression. So boys and men need to connect with their aggression and learn to channel it. This is a physical act which can mean training, or just yelling your lungs out in private about everything that's pissing you off. At first, this can feel frightening because we were taught that aggression always winds up hurting someone. But letting this energy flow in contained environments will help you to set those boundaries that we talked about and make you more confident and competent in every area of your life. And this takes us to the second point — the warrior defends sacred solitude. Almost everything in the modern world is fighting to keep you pseudo-connected all the time. And I say pseudo-connected because it's not true connection as much as it is distracted engagement. What happens when you're just scrolling and scrolling and you just can't, like, stop? Well, social media has essentially taken human connection and turned it into a drug. The moment you turn it on, it's like playing you a new thing. Playing you a new thing. You're like — and you're just sucked into it. This is why the warrior must create sacred solitude. This is non-negotiable daily time alone and it allows him to connect with what truly matters to him and to apply himself to training that is required to manifest his goals. Because I know you're into meditation. I know you spend a lot of time in dark rooms. There is something what you can do better, yeah, every day. And that's my idea of the training life idea. Now, for people who are not professional fighters, this looks at least like taking some time every day with your phone on do not disturb or leaving it behind entirely. It means that you take dedicated work sessions with no distractions or interruptions and the productivity gains alone are worth it but the real value of this solitude is in knowing that you have honored your own priorities. And that takes us to the next point — the warrior seeks out risk. There is no glory to be had now. Only retreat or surrender or death. Well, that's an easy choice for us, Arcadian. Spartans never retreat. So much of our modern safety-obsessed world demonizes risk. As young boys, we were encouraged to not do things that might get us hurt and made to feel reckless if we did and as adults, well-meaning loved ones encourage us to take the path that carries the least possibility of pain. We're not going to let you ruin your life. Tomorrow, I'm withdrawing you from Welton and enrolling you in Braden Military School. You're going to Harvard and you're going to be a doctor. But what the warrior knows is that without risk, he cannot tap into his deepest capabilities — the ones that are buried beneath self-doubt and fear. He knows that the possibility of meaningful failure is actually a gift. So the warrior seeks out risk and makes friends with fear. This relationship means that he knows how to risk wisely in the perfect amount to keep him on his edge. Why can't you change your thinking? Everybody else does. Because I'm a fighter. That's the way I'm made, Adrian. Which is unlike the man who never risks anything and then overestimates his abilities. And even if the warrior loses, he grows faster than others, eventually accomplishing what seemed impossible. This takes us to the final point — the warrior embraces the power of death. Are you a man who once said death smiles at us all? All a man can do is smile back. Death is often denied in the modern era. So much of our society is organized around hiding it from ourselves. Our sick and our dying are removed from communal spaces so that by the time we're adults, most of us have actually only seen maybe a handful of dead bodies. The death we do encounter is in video games and media where it's easily surmounted and stripped of its full weight or it's something that happens over there in another part of the world to people unlike us. The warrior knows, though, that death walks with him at every moment and this fills every moment with overwhelming gratitude. The gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal. Because any moment might be our last. Everything's more beautiful because we're doomed. His time on earth is a blessing that will not last forever and this person to live fully without shame. This is liberating because so many men are drowning in shame. Don't cry, don't laugh too loudly, don't look dumb singing or dancing or enjoying yourself too much or, God forbid, trying earnestly and failing. But in the face of death, all of those concerns are irrelevant. So the warrior sings, dances, laughs, plays, and fights all out. It's an honor to die at your side. It's an honor to have lived at yours. And you're already dead! Brothers, what we do in life echoes in eternity. He lives with an open heart because there is nothing to lose and he is magnetic to others because he is fully alive. Those who cling to death live. Those who cling to life die. So as you reflect on this, I want you to ask yourself, how do you want to spend your precious time? What have you been holding back in order to feel safe? And what are you willing to live all out for? You don't need to answer with words, just feel it. If you want to know the best way that I have to get into that place of felt warrior clarity, I've worked with a friend to create a special breathwork session just for that and I cannot recommend it enough. Breathwork is my sacred solitude every day and this warrior track is great.

Most the time I smell like a foot I could barely get myself out of my robe. You knew I liked you You've been on the show. Yeah, there's that pause right there. That is letting awkwardness sit with the power of AI and hindsight we are going to dive into some of the most awkward celebrity interviews and Fix them and hopefully if you watch this and take a few mental notes You will learn how to avoid these awkward situations in your own life as well Let's dive in using the powers of artificial intelligence and un awkward this interaction. This is a good one Congrats on your little bump in this scenario. You guys may have seen this video Basically, what happens is Blake Lively is pregnant. She's beginning to show my understanding is this was a public knowledge thing at this point The interviewer comments congrats on your little bump. Congrats on your pregnancy to which Blake replies Congrats on not being pregnant or maybe you're fat or the implication is not totally clear but it is not kind and she will go on for the rest of this interview to ignore the Host or the interviewer most of the time she'll be making eye contact mostly with her co-star in this situation We can fix it though We can make it not awkward because Blake is now is catching a lot of crap for this interview And I'm just gonna show you with the power of AI how we would do that First of all, congrats on your little bump Thank you Problem solved the rest of this interview doesn't have to go the way that it went this problem doesn't come back to bite Blake Lively years in the future It is generally the most charismatic and prudent thing to do when you receive a communication from someone that feels like it might be An attack is to project positive intent onto that and what I often tell people is take any ambiguous communication especially early in an interaction and Assume that it's positive Even if they were trying to take a shot at you when you read positivity into what people say it kind of can just derail That whole negative train they were going down and flip things to the positive and now you're in the place you want to be Anyway, so that's what you can do Let's say that you are insecure about this and you don't want people pointing that out speak to that Insecurity own the insecurity and make a bit of a light joke This will let somebody know please don't continue going down this particular route If you speak your insecurity rather than allowing it to come through passive aggressively, that's gonna be much more effective Let's assume that you're on the flip side. You're in the interviewer shoes and we get to this moment here Do you guys love wearing those kind of clothes that you yeah Yeah, and you know working in digital talk about the clothes, but I wonder if they would ask the men about the clothes I would so at this moment one of the things that you can do when someone is being a passive aggressive towards you is Invite them to take that passive aggression and make it active and you do that with a question that speaks directly to the thing that They're not directly saying But I wonder if they would ask the men about the clothes Would you prefer that I didn't ask you questions about clothes you stop the hiding behind I wonder if people would ask other people about this and you bring you and I into this and ask them their preference One of two things is gonna happen here. They're gonna say yeah, you know, I would like that or they're gonna say no No, and now they're sort of backtracking and undoing the thing that they said and will probably wind up apologizing in some form to you Or at least stopping with that continued passive aggression because you've invited it to come out directly. So let's move on to another sort of Situation that could be read as a passive aggressive dig that made a moment of awkwardness this one another famous one First of all, you smell good, which is surprising Why is that Guy who would have a nice scent on I'm gonna really work hard to not take that as a shot So Jonah is actually in this moment doing an externalization of the internal monologue that I just described Which is I'm going to take this ambiguous communication and interpret it positively And he's just saying that he's that's what he's doing out loud. I think you would smell nice. No, but I don't Don't have So the nice thing here is that Jonah sort of calls it out, but then he releases it He doesn't continue to punish Jimmy over and over and over again This is not a very uncommon way for men to interact or these comedians to start conversations like this with some sort of a joke that is not necessarily the implication is not the nicest to the guest the way to handle this most of the time is to Agree and exaggerate and just let it go. So what that would look like here something like this First of all, you smell good, which is surprising most the time I smell like a foot I can barely get myself out of my robe So this is a really important occasion for me to agree and exaggerate that moment would let it go just as quickly In fact more quickly than calling it out and inviting an awkwardness And here's a great example of Robert Downey jr. Doing that same tip on the same show just a few years earlier I Do think what was happening here is that Jonah was always the butt of the joke in any sort of group He was like made fun of for being the Hollywood fat guy Are you the fat guy in Hollywood still or do you have any other questions that are smart? He came back after years and having done therapy and was working on Asserting boundaries so that that habit of being made the butt of the joke wasn't something that continued to happen him all of the time And I think he was a bit sensitive to it here, which is why he handled it the way that he did this is a totally viable reasonable way to handle a situation where you don't like the comment that somebody made to you and It will put them on notice that they probably shouldn't do that to you in advance because it's gonna get awkward Which is actually a key thing that I did not understand about awkwardness There's lots of times in your life where you want to allow awkwardness to exist Because it's actually for the other person to feel it so that they don't continue to treat you and the Uncomfortable way that they've been treating you which actually takes us very well into our next clip. This one is Legendary, let's watch the Ellen Dakota Johnson Birthday fiasco happy belated birthday. When was your birthday? It was October 4th, October 4th. How was the party? I wasn't invited. I just want to pause here. We'll come back to this the context of jokes really matters There are jokes through where the context is. You're so awesome. There's jokes where the context is You're such a loser. The context of this joke is You should be guilty for not being nice to me, which isn't a great joke context I'll unpack this later, but let's see how it plays out Actually, no, that's not the truth Ellen you were invited last no last time I was on the show last year You gave me a bunch about not inviting you but I didn't even know you wanted to be invited So this what Dakota is doing in this moment is allowing awkwardness to enter the interaction. She is not saving Ellen from it She's saying no this is what happened and she's contradicting her and she's letting it roll Which is fine If you don't want somebody to make that sort of comment You have to kind of let the awkwardness sit so that they learn from it. You knew I liked you You've been on the show. Yeah, there's that pause right there. That is letting awkwardness sit. You knew I liked you You've been on the show many times and don't I show like Yeah, but I did invite you and you didn't there's a real opportunity to relieve tension take some responsibility here by cracking a joke that Is something to the effect of cue the AI? Actually, no, that's not the truth. Ellen. You were invited now I feel like an idiot for trying to make you feel guilty shows me right It just is a kind of taking back that responsibility in a fun and playful but clear way that would have I think made this entire Segment not nearly as frustrating for people to watch back years later We're gonna move on this one asked the question. What can you do? If someone else is just breaking every social norm and it's making you feel uncomfortable. You might have seen this one I've covered a lot of fashion weeks. This is the first time I've run in to Jim Carrey Wait, tell me is it true? You're wandering the streets. You need a date to the party. What's up? No, no No, I'm doing just fine. I just you know, there's no meaning to any of this So I I wanted to find the most meaningless thing that I could come to so Initially she's just not liking the way he responded this question, but it plays out a little bit I don't think this is the moment where it goes sideways Okay, so this moment right here Where she looks at the camera this look communicates. Oh Shit, what is going on here? This guy is crazy in these sorts of moments for one reason or another We have a set of social Expectations of how we're gonna behave in a restaurant or at work or something else and then for whatever reason somebody else does not obey Those expectations we can get vicarious Cringe in those situations what you want to learn to do is to sit back and allow that Awkwardness to exist without feeling that it is your job to fix it and even these moments where somebody's being absurd as long as they're not hurting anyone can actually be Enjoyable and fun to watch if you don't take on this burden of I have to make this social Arrangement work in the way that I'm used to in her case It's I have to talk about fashion and why it's important in this particular interview Just sit back and let a guy who is one of the most famous comedians of the world. Just talk shit What do you do believe in icons? Personalities, I don't believe that you exist, but there is a wonderful fragrance in the air This is a wonderful opportunity for what we talked about earlier, which is agree and exaggerate So he just said something effective. I don't believe you exist, but there's a wonderful fragrance in the air How could you agree and exaggerate on that and start to play with this energy rather than fight it? Which is what the interviewer continues to do. I don't believe that you exist, but there is a Wonderful fragrance in the air Monkeys wearing rags wandering the world sounded furious signifying nothing you know just just nonsense because I think the problem was I was sitting here trying to think of like a clever way to respond and if you watch The rest of this which is yeah, he's he's while he is alluding to some philosophical and spiritual ideas of no self He's also just making noise Shut her down now the underlying thing here for awkwardness is that we often Take so seriously what we're doing and it's easy for us sitting on the outside to look at this woman at a fashion show and say Yeah, obviously this doesn't matter just enjoy the conversation But it's very hard to see those opportunities in our own life to just take it a bit easier and not allow the awkwardness To exist because it's not supposed to go any differently than it is These are what I have for you today.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Something bad is going on with young men. It's bad for them, and it's bad for the women around them. I have been feeling and seeing how poorly young men are doing. Why are men and boys struggling? Why are men in such crisis? And what made me really see it is a bit silly, but stick with me here. It was the Amazon Prime show, Reacher. Now, if you haven't seen it, Reacher is a show based on the Lee Child novels of the same name. They're action-packed male fantasy fulfillment. And in them, we follow Reacher, the impossibly jacked wanderer, who miraculously doesn't go to the gym and eats whatever he wants. How do you eat like that and still look like you do? Like this. He kills bad guys, saves the day, and beds a new woman most every book. This is nothing new in the male fantasy fulfillment genre, except there is something that's weirdly new. In the show, Reacher, who is the most assertive, dominant action hero you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams, never initiates anything sexual. He's entirely passive with his female leads. We barely even see him look at the leading lady, who inevitably has to make the first, second, and third move before throwing herself at him. Now, this was not the case in the books from the early 2000. It's an amendment from the 2020 show. Dude, it just becomes like a fantasy of this guy who every guy wants to be. You want to get the girl in every town you visit, and Jack Reacher fulfills that fantasy. And just so you know that I'm not exaggerating here, in season one, after asking him to dance and hanging out in a hotel room with him in her underwear, Roscoe literally has to walk in on Reacher showering to make something happen between them. And she, of course, leans in for the kiss in case he didn't pick up on her intention. In season two, Dixon indirectly asks Reacher out at work. Will you buy me a drink? I gotta keep working on these reports. Maybe next time. Yeah. Then she directly asks him why he didn't do anything about it. Is that why? Back in the day, you and I never happened. I mean, come on, Reacher, it's not like I didn't drop any hints. Then she has him play doctor with a wound on her breast. And when he doesn't lean in then, she finally throws herself at him. You don't have to be lonely tonight. As the relationship continues, she makes every overt move. Shot at by Hitman and almost blown up. Need to put it mildly. I've got some pent-up tension. Season three is the same exact dance until Duffy finally just leans in and jumps Reacher. I can still make sure she stays safe. I know it's important to you, so I wanna make sure. Later, Reacher bashfully compliments her, but of course can barely hold eye contact. If he cheated on you, he's an idiot. And in the middle of the tactical planning for her coming shootout, she completely jumps Reacher's bones. You really wanna make me feel better? I got an idea. Now, I'm not saying that we should go back to the cardboard cutout female characters with zero agency. The male fantasy genre 50 years ago had its own issues. Man talk. What I'm saying is that if Reacher is the updated male fantasy, we need to ask ourselves, what does this fantasy of sexual passivity tell us about young men today? Think about that. Because before I give you my answer, I wanna tell you about the male fantasies of my bygone era, the 2000s, and what they told us about my generation. You see, when I was a teen, there was one movie that mirrored the dream of so many young men and their hopes about women. The Girl Next Door. My God, did this movie hook me. I personally kind of find it a perfect film, in my opinion at least. It's the teen fantasy that lit up the early 2000s. The Girl Next Door became an instant cult favorite. In it, Maddie, who is played by Emile Hirsch, has a stunningly beautiful girl move in next door to him. And when she does, his entire life is turned upside down by her impact on him. Finding that one thing you really care about. That one special thing that means more to you than anything else in the world. Now, the fantasy, which is specific to the 2000s, is that she sees something in him without him doing anything stereotypically attractive. Maddie gets the girl of his dreams just by being his nerdy, previously unnoticed self. She literally appears next door and just likes him. This was, of course, my fantasy and the wish of many mathletes across the world. I'm all wet, can I come in? But even though Maddie is smaller and nerdier and way less capable, there's one thing he has that Richard doesn't. He is undeniably attracted to Danielle. His desire for her cannot be hidden or suppressed and his victory is in acting on that desire despite not being the stereotypical hot guy. In the act one climax, which is such an iconic scene that I wish I could just play it outright, Maddie's at a party and the jock has just slid up on his girl. Maddie is out. Man, what's up? Can you come here for a second? Oh, no, that's cool, they're pals. Danielle is now with the jock because, come on, look at that guy. And just as Maddie's about to leave and defeat, something shifts. Maddie acts on his desire and we get one of the defining shots of my teenage life. Maddie wins because he goes for it. He doesn't do a million pushups or beat anyone up, he just goes for it. This is the inverse of Richard, who is super high agency in every action scene. If you boys knew what's about to happen to you, you'd leave now. So I give you to the count of three. One. But totally passive around women. You think I'm doing the asking? Come on. Now, of course, this is a teen movie and Richard's action-based, so maybe it's an unfair comparison. So let's look at an action film from the same 2000s era, Casino Royale. The name's Bond. James Bond. We have the same impossibly capable lead who kills bad guys and gets the girl. Doesn't bother you, killing those people? I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did. But in 2006, he, of course, still wants her. Bond's desire for Vesper is immediate and he's anything but passive in communicating it. I'm the money. Every penny of it. So as far as I can remember, in the 2000s, male desire for women still existed in that stereotypical male fantasy genre. Victory came from risking rejection to act on that desire. That one special thing that means more to you than anything else in the world. And when you find her, you fight for her. You risk it all. And a capable man could handle rejection without forcing the issue or getting overly flustered. And this is what worries me about Reacher. Desire for women. And if it were gay, it doesn't matter. It's desire for sex, for intimacy, for a relationship. It's all gone. Sure, Reacher is a participant, but he's not an active initiator. And by the way, I see the same thing in a lighter form in 2019's Witcher. They say we're not going to be able to get married. I'm not going to be able to get married. Geralt acknowledges his attraction to Yennefer, but it's her initiating at every stage. You can't contend with me. Sorry I couldn't be direct. I knew you'd fight it. Now, perhaps I'm extrapolating based on just one show and I'm reading too many books. I'm reading too many books. I'm reading too many books. I'm reading too many books. I'm reading too many books. I'm reading too many books. and I'm reading too much into it. But consider how broader media habits have shifted since the 2000s. It had its serious issues, but TV required you to feel what you wanted. You had to tune in at a particular time to watch your show. You had to select the YouTube video based on a title that said, this is what I want to watch. Sure, we had the channel surf, but every millennial knows how miserable of an experience that aimless searching was. Now, the TikTok mentality is basically, I don't know what I want. Feed me anyway. What happens when you're just scrolling and strolling and you just can't like stop? Well, social media has essentially taken human connection and turned it into a drug. The moment you turn it on, it's like playing you a new thing, playing it on. You're like, and you're just sucked into it. And it's not miserable. You can be entertained for hours without once feeling your own desire. So that's the meta landscape that this is occurring in. But there's also what I hear from young men. Up until a few years ago, I had never spoken to a young man who planned to spend his 20s on his business and his money and his health while ignoring dating completely. As a man, you need to, before you get into any relationship, build your frame as a man, build your internal kingdom. Staying single puts you ahead of everyone, everyone. Just think about it. Just go fucking monk mode, everything. Like as long as it takes to get to the top. And that's now something that I've heard repeatedly. And I don't think that's the purely rational monk mode move that it's sometimes framed as. I think it's the result of being raised in a world where feeling your own desires, particularly the sexual and romantic ones, was more dangerous than ever. And in part, that's because rejection in the social media era is so much more public. And perhaps it's in part because the Me Too had a chilling effect, not just on the men that we wanted it to, but also on the young guys who weren't quite sure where the line between healthy romantic initiation and cancellation where the boundary crossing was. I often hear from men that they are now more reluctant to go to a woman in a bar or whatever. That there's this problem of fear of being falsely accused of something. So they chose to just avoid the whole thing altogether. And I think that's where this passive fantasy we see in Reacher comes from. It's the wish that if you're maximally capable, you won't ever have to face rejection from a woman. You'll never have to even initiate. It'll just find you. And that scares me because we need men who are connected to what and who they want, who are capable of risking their egos to pursue those desires, and who are capable of dusting themselves and their egos off in the face of rejection. If you don't have that, if you can't feel your most raw, instinctual desires, you will spend your whole life as a sheep. You'll chase socially approved stepping stones, telling yourself that one day, you'll go after the real thing. So you can make money, sculpt your body, build a social Rolodex, but you do it all in avoidance of the things that you really want. So my advice to you is that if you find any of this compelling, ask yourself, where in my life am I avoiding what I deeply want by telling myself that I need to focus on stepping stones? Is there someone that I'm attracted to, but I won't ask out until I have that six pack in six months or six years? Is there a business that I wanna start, but I won't begin until I have the right made up credential? Is there a creative project that I haven't shared because I'm not yet perfect enough at that thing? If something comes up, my advice is to go for it, risk rejection, especially in a world where everyone else is distracted with imaginary stepping stones. The person who can risk rejection and pursue their deepest desires is the one who winds up leading. Now for me, skipping stepping stones meant that I had to take a good hard look at my social life. And when I did, I realized that I wasn't approaching the women that I liked the most or asking for the promotions that I wanted and felt I deserved or connecting with the people that I admired all because of social fears and awkwardness.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"There is an incredible scene in the show Shogun, and it highlights a psychological battle I have fought my whole life. So in this video, I want to share what exactly that battle is, how it ruins most people's lives, and three questions that I used and recommend you use that will help you to avoid that outcome and change your life for the better. But let's get back to Shogun, because this will all make a lot more sense when you watch that battle play out on screen. So in this scene, we have John Blackthorne, who is this Englishman, and he is shipwrecked in Japan in the early 1600s. My name is John Blackthorne. I'm English, pilot of the Erasmus. And he's talking with his interpreter, Mariko. Now, Mariko is miserable because she is living her life entirely for other people. She's married to this guy that she just hates and has gotten so bad that she does not want to live. So Blackthorne, being this Western explorer individualist, says this to her. You'd die to avenge your father. You'd live in anguish. To spite your husband. Which is it? What becomes of you? My life is mine, and yours is yours. If you can't see that, you'll never be free of this prison. When I watched this scene, I was nodding along in total agreement, because this is my philosophy. I want to be free. I want to live my life. Trying to please others and live up to social expectation has basically felt like a prison for as long as I can remember. But Mariko's response to him, I swear, it made my heart drop. It is you who is imprisoned. If freedom is all you ever live for, you will never be free of yourself. I want to say bars here, but I'm too old for that, so I'll just say, ouch. Just so, so dead on. Because yes, I can confirm, maximal freedom can easily turn into an insatiable pursuit of more, more, more. And that could be a $10 billion step, and I eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company. You'll never get enough. You're just going to make yourself more and more thirsty. Like, when I set my first goals, quitting the job that I'd hated, starting my own business, working on my charisma, that was all so thrilling, so fulfilling, 10 out of 10, definitely, definitely recommend doing that. But there came a point where that way of being expired. I had hit my real goals, and setting new ones for more revenue or more subscribers felt empty. My first goal was, say, 100,000 and then a million, and I just watched the goal posts get moved while my satisfaction with the completion of those goals did not rise. But with no worthy goals to orient me, I was also rudderless and lost. I had all of this freedom and nothing worthy to do with it. So like Marako said, I was in a prison of my own making. It is you who is imprisoned. If freedom is all you ever live for, you will never be free of yourself. And that's when I started to wonder, what if Blackthorn and Marako are both right? What if the real trap is thinking that we have to choose one or the other? I've lived thinking about that for years at this point, and I've gone back and forth trying to figure it out. One moment, it was believing, Marako's right. Maybe freedom leads nowhere, so just get back to helping other people and find meaning in that. And then the next, I would swing all the way back to the Blackthorn. Maybe I hadn't aimed my personal ambition high enough. I needed more goals. It's been years of me going back and forth in that, and I want to let you know what I've come up with because it feels really good. I believe that many of us grew up like Marako. We thought that if there was any social disharmony, it was our fault. So we adjusted ourselves to try to make things in our families and friend groups go more smoothly. That meant doing whatever we had to in order to fit in and be liked. So we developed these functioning social relationships by becoming what other people wanted from us. You're just the very reason my father kept me alive. This is a super ego-driven life. The question that we're constantly asking in this way is, what should I be doing? Or, what will make the people around me like me more and love me? Now, this can work for a while. It gets you solid relationships, but it will feel awful at some point, Marako can attest. Do not be fooled by our politeness, our vows, our maze of rituals. We need it all. We could be a great distance away. So I and many others snapped to the other direction. Give the guns to Fujisama. She's your consort. She will give her life to defend them. I could damn well defend myself. I'm going to do me. I'm not going to do what you want. I'm going to do what I want, which means separating from our prior group in some way. It was only when I studied abroad that I created that space to break out of the sweet, shy boy identity. Because if you don't do that disconnection in some way, the expectations of the people around you are usually too heavy for you to break out of and embrace the freedom to define yourself. But I do think that that phase that I went through of living your life ferociously separate from the expectations of others, that Blackthorn way of living, is a coping strategy. Just like the strategy of doing whatever it takes to fit in, that Marako way is a coping strategy. First we're anxious Marakos, then we're avoidant Blackthorns. And we become that Blackthorn avoidant because living as Marako hurts so much. But living separately hurts too, so most people spend their lives tipping back and forth, ping-ponging between these strategies. And they only shift when one extreme hurts too much just to repeat the cycle over and over again. And yes, I'm telling on myself here. And so I got turned off to the whole process of trying to grow past a certain point of enough. Except, and I hope that you have experienced these, there are those few precious moments where you're doing exactly what you want and it winds up being what is most valuable for other people. If you think of this as a Venn diagram with Blackthorn and Marako, self and other, there is that little sliver of overlap in the middle. And when you hit it, it is the most amazing feeling. And it usually comes as a surprise. For instance, I had no plan to help anyone when I quit my job and moved to Brazil. I was just focusing on solving the biggest problem in my life, which was relationships. And still, to this day, they are. But it was fun to share what I was learning with others at the time. So I started writing and then making videos. I'm here on Ipanema Beach answering reader questions. Ten years later, without even meaning to, I have made more of a positive impact doing that, what I wanted, than I'd ever imagined. And it all happened while I was living my own dream. It happened seemingly by accident. Charlie, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people have benefited from your work. But actually, as I look back and I really think about it, it wasn't an accident. I actually think that's inevitable. Because when you align with what is most important to you, it is impossible not to be of service to others. That means that there is this way to combine the best of Marako and Blackthorn where following your deepest, very personal desires is the greatest offering to the group. And the magic of this is that that thin slice of the Venn diagram can grow. And that way, over time, just doing what you want, lazily, can become a gift to others, to your relationships, to your livelihood. That way, you get more connected, you get more wealthy, and more fully yourself. That is the freedom that I've always wanted and I believe it is actually the way the world works. The catch is that you have to really connect with the deep you. That means deeper than your surface-level ego desires. It's fine if you want money or status but from what I've seen, I am most able to feel truly free when I step out of my survival fears, that more, more, more money, more status, more whatever, and I drop into the things that I truly want. And I found that there are three orienting questions that help me get on that path to my deepest wants. So ask yourself right now, what would I do if I had $100 million? This is the question that led to me moving to Brazil in the first place. Second question, what would I do if I knew I couldn't fail and no one would be upset with me? When you break out of this, there's no social expectation and this led to me throwing myself into uncomfortable social situations. The third, what gift do I most love giving? For me, it's that I basically wanted to be a big brother to myself so I want to help versions of me that are three to five years younger. These questions are so powerful because they take you out of the fear that has you bouncing from anxious, people-pleasing to avoidant, withdrawing. You're not back and forth with this Mariko Blackthorn dilemma of being imprisoned by the other and then yourself. You transcend that and that means that you're able to become who you truly are which is an individual like Blackthorn who embraces deep connection with others like Mariko. Blackthorn's selfishness becomes sovereignty. Mariko's servitude becomes service. It's the best of both worlds and that little sliver of the Venn diagram can grow into a deep whole life of connection with self and other. So ask yourself those questions seriously. Write down the answers but most importantly, live them. You do not need to know where the answers to these questions is going to lead you. I promise you, I did not but it was the asking of those questions, the orienting towards them that led me without having any sort of grand plan to create Charisma on Command. And now when I ask those questions again today, they point me somewhere kind of new which I don't know where that is yet but it feels really exciting. I did Charisma for five years before I made a dime and I'm willing to do Dungeons and Dragons or explore psychedelics and open a clinic for five, ten years because it's what I like to do. And by the way, if one of the things that you answered with that $100 million question is I want to feel more confident, I want to feel more charismatic, you might enjoy checking out my course, Charisma University. This is the 30-day program that I made so that developing charisma and confidence is as fast as possible. It's the thing that I wish that I had when I started years ago. And it's got a step-by-step action guide so that you know exactly what to do every single day for 30 days to guarantee massive results. And this is what just a few students have said about what they took from the course. I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet they want me to fill this position and when I asked why this was the answer, you have great social skills which is rare for an engineer. You can think quickly on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you have taught me. You have truly changed my life because without Charisma University, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. Or check out this student's experience with dating. Loving the course. I've liked a girl for over a year now but never thought much of it because I thought she was just too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we are dating. And try this one out for friendship. It has been truly incredible. I have instantly had results that seem insane. So many more meaningful conversations. My friendships have improved and my interactions with total strangers are a new, exciting, fulfilling thing. I want to recommend this to everyone. This should be in our basic education system.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Some people are extremely judgmental about height and it sucks to be judged for something that's totally out of your control. But there are tricks you can steal from some of the world's most charismatic men to help you command more respect from the people around you regardless of your height. This video isn't meant to be a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, think of it as a menu to choose from. Pick the advice that fits the charisma style you like most. First, let's look at a few different ways you can address your height starting with Kevin Hart's strategy. Did people make fun of you because of your height? I did it before they did. You did it before they did. Self-deprecation. Anything that the person thinks that they can say, I disarm you of it by saying it myself. That's your first option. Go there first with a joke. If you don't consider yourself very clever, here's a few quick jokes you can steal. Yeah, that was a moment where she looked down into my eyes. I'm just small. Like, look, here's the bad part with me. Like, if I sit all the way back. Especially in that last clip, it would have been easy for Kevin to stay quiet and simply feel insecure sitting next to Shaq. But instead, Kevin jokes about his height and takes the spotlight in a positive way. Tom Holland has a different approach. Talk about it like it's no big deal. For example, watch his response when asked about his Spider-Man being the first Spider-Man who's shorter than his girlfriend, MJ. I mean, you'd have to ask John what's his question, but every girl that we tested for both roles was taller than me. And I wonder whether, John, that was a decision that John had made. There was no one that tested that was shorter than I was. To be fair, I am quite short. Conveying that you're comfortable with your height comes down to body language and tone. Contrast Tom Holland with this next clip where someone on a blind date show talks about their height. He looks like he's anywhere from 5'7 to 5'10, maybe 5'10. I'm not 5'7. I'm not 5'8. I'm like 5'9 and a quarter. 5'9 isn't even short, but by fidgeting, having downcast eyes, and trying to get credit for that extra quarter inch, you get the sense that he thinks his height isn't good enough. In terms of projecting confidence, you'd be much better off smiling, holding eye contact, and saying, yeah, 5'9, she nailed it. It's by discussing your height without shame that you seem the most confident. This won't magically make it a non-issue if someone is super prejudiced about height, but for most people, your confidence around the issue will have a big impact on how they perceive you. There is another option for how to address your height. Simply don't make it a part of the conversation. Our team watched a lot of Tom Cruise for this video and never saw him talk about his height. And a lot of Talk Show hosts and comedians have made fun of it over the years. So it's not like he doesn't know it's out there. He just ignores it. These are all fine approaches, but there is one benefit to doing things Kevin's way. When you tease yourself, it sets you up to tease other people without them taking it seriously. For example, watch how The Rock reacts in this next clip. Just a little jump up. Idiot! Now, it's worth noting that while Kevin and the Toms are often shorter than the people they're speaking with, they each have habits that give them a big presence that keeps people captivated. Kevin's trick isn't for everyone, but it's very effective for him. Simply be the loudest person in the room. Notice in this next clip how he commands the conversation despite multiple people trying to talk over him. How come you didn't play in a celebrity game this year, man? You're the perennial MVP. What else do you want from me? I'm a four-time MVP. I'm in a Hall of Fame of celebrity games. It's over. It's over. I can't do it anymore. I achieved greatness, Shaq. You know what that feels like. If the idea of being loud makes you uncomfortable, you can also create a big magnetic presence by using expansive hand gestures when you speak. For example, watch how Tom Holland uses his hands to capture attention and really own the space around him. I mean, I remember seeing Avengers 1 with one of my best friends, Tom Hutton, in the cinema as a kid, so excited. And now I'm in it. You know, I'm walking around with Iron Man and Captain America, and I can now kind of call them peers and stuff, so it's still pretty surreal. So we're doing this scene. Harry's upside down, swinging back and forward, and bless him, he's doing a really good job, and as the day is going on, he's got these lines, and he's starting to forget his lines, and his eyes are about to pop out of his head. Did you notice how Tom's hands get so far from his body while he speaks? Most people do the opposite. They subconsciously try to take up as little space as possible. If that's you, it might get interpreted as a lack of confidence. You can also expand your presence by freely using neutral space. For example, notice how on The Tonight Show, Tom Cruise makes it a habit to touch Jimmy's desk. An entrance right there, yeah. Thank you, bud. Yeah, what do you think? Nice, nice, uh, thank you. Congratulations. Thank you, brother. I loved it so much. Yes, you get to see what it's like. I dig that you get this. Are you vinyl, too? I'm full on vinyl. Yeah, yeah. Going from the airplane, and it was also cold in the airplane. This isn't to say you should crowd other people out, but assume unused neutral space is available for you to use. You can also expand your presence with platonic touch. Often when someone reaches out for a handshake, Tom Cruise will take things one level further with an off-handed pat or a quick hug. Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Cruise! Thank you. New America! This increased level of platonic touch helps to build connection. And the person is likely to mirror you, which also means they're following your lead in the interaction. There is one more thing that Kevin Hart, Tom Cruise, and Tom Holland all have in common. Many people mistakenly think the only way to command respect is to be that low-emotion, non-reactive James Bond type. But an even easier, more consistent way to command respect is simply by being positive. There's something magnetic about someone who smiles effusively and laughs easily. It feels uplifting to be around. And people want to be around people who make them feel good. One specific way you can do that — celebrate other people's success. Some people who try to command respect see the world as a competition. They mistakenly think that if someone else looks good, it makes you look bad. So they'll always try to reorient the conversation away from other people's successes to their own, not realizing this actually makes you look insecure. Instead, recognize that being able to genuinely praise others makes you look secure in yourself. This is a habit that Kevin, Tom, and Tom all have. They're comfortable passing the spotlight to others and making them look good. And ironically, that habit makes you look good, too. Watch these next few clips and notice in yourself, even though they're talking about somebody else, how does it make you feel about them? Being honest, you guys work so hard. You know, look at the training. We call him Six-Pack Peggles. Yeah, no, he's the best, man. I mean, Jake Gyllenhaal, for me, he's been my hero since I was a little kid. I mean, his movies are amazing. It's hard to name a bad Jake Gyllenhaal film. I bow down to him. I don't give a f**k about these numbers or anything I got. Dave, in my opinion, you're the GOAT. Ultimately, this all comes down to a mindset about accepting yourself and focusing on what you can control. Being the best version of yourself instead of worrying about things that are outside of your control. Yes, some people are prejudiced and may judge you for your height, but that doesn't mean that you have to define yourself by your height. Height is one of many, many factors that contribute to how someone perceives you. Since you can't control it, the best thing you can do is focus on the things you can control. One of those factors that's way more in your control than most people think is your charisma. Unlike height, your charisma, your presence, your ability to command respect with your voice, or even just your body language, that's all in your control and something you can learn to master. If you want the quickest way that I know of to have more confidence and charisma, you may like our program, Charisma University. Rather than tell you about the program myself, here are a few things that past members have said. I had confidence in some areas, but not in others. Then Charisma University changed that for me. Since beginning the program, I have seen noticeable changes in my life. It has helped me unlock the confidence that comes with knowing that I can go into any social situation and crush it. Another member wrote in, I've always been bad at expressing myself in situations that weren't one-on-one. In conversations, I'd find myself hesitant to speak or I'd get caught in my own head overthinking things. After CU, I am now way more confident in saying what I think. I feel much happier all the time. I was even able to talk to a woman I've had a crush on for about a year and made a great first impression. Overall, I love this course and I keep going back to it when I need a refresher on the daily action modules. And lastly, one member writes, Thank you so much for this program. After going through Charisma, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I've solidified my values and I know who I am. The program is literally guaranteed to change your life. That means you can take the entire course and if you don't think it's worth every penny, you can give yourself a full refund from right inside the program.

I really appreciate you taking the time to watch it and I hope to see you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 537}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Today, we'll go over how to handle it when someone insults you. We'll start with a few comebacks that are great at winning over a crowd and embarrassing the person who insulted you. The downside is they can make the target of your comeback hate you. Then we'll cover some friendlier, more charismatic responses so you can come away looking cool and confident without making enemies. One strategy when someone insults you is an Aikido insult. Accept their insult and use it against them. I look like I f***ed a pig. Do I still owe you my money? Is she annoyed, is she? Have you never heard of standards? Yeah, that's... No. I don't have any. I can tell. Yeah, I'm with you guys here, that's why. This is one of the best ways to win over a crowd. You're only able to insult the other person because they insulted you, so you make people laugh without looking rude. There's an easy way you can do this even if you can't think of a clever comeback. Point out they're easy to dislike. For example, watch Theo Vong get insulted in this next clip. He clearly doesn't like it. No, shut up, dude. You look like you just got your s*** cut at Supercuts. Just like a number 7 at the Lemon Tree. Lemon Tree! Motherf***er! Eventually, Theo hits him with this next line. You can steal this word for word the next time someone tries to disrespect you. Holy s***. If you could even... If you could ever meet yourself, you would hate it. The key here is to smile while you say it. That's what prevents you from looking defensive and gets the people around you to laugh. And again, it only works because of how rude they were to you, so you roast them without looking like a jerk. If someone insults you with a joke, you can also turn it back on them with a Trojan horse compliment. This is where you compliment the joke in a way that roasts the insulter. You look like a DJ at a rave. Dip slow. Bro, you look like a sh... dip slow. Dude, I'm so used to you not telling good jokes, I almost didn't even listen to that. These first three strategies will help you win over a crowd, but they won't necessarily make the person you're talking to like you. So another option is to genuinely compliment the insult. This can make you look extremely self-confident and help you build rapport with the other person. Who's most likely to be caught napping between takes? Actually, it's usually me during Dwayne's close-up. Oh, that was good. Who's most likely to break out into laughter in the middle of a take? I have no self-control. I feel that you are humorless. Oh, that's so good. You may think this only works among friends, but it can work with strangers, too. The key is to assume positive intent. When you assume positive intent, you hear a lot more jokes than insults. One, honesty or flattery? Honesty. Your forehead is bigger than my dream. That was good. That was good. That was good. I do have a big forehead. Don't worry. My dreams are small. Oh, it's even better. There is power in laughing along with a funny insult. If someone insults you and you don't think of anything clever to say and you don't laugh, then it seems like you're being laughed at. You have the same haircut as Jane Lynch. I don't know where the f... you got that haircut. Whatever. That's not that funny, guys. If you find yourself in that same situation and you are able to genuinely laugh, you put yourself in on the joke and project laid-back self-confidence. Dude, you look like my third-grade gym teacher, Mrs. Klein. Oh, yeah? She was like this lesbian we used to call a Liu Kang. You kind of look like Liu Kang from Street Fighter, if he was a white dude and had money. Thanks, man. Yeah. With friends, an even better reaction to look confident and build rapport is to play along. Specifically, agree and exaggerate. You can get a laugh by jokingly exaggerating the thing that they just accused you of. Who is the biggest diva in the whole cast? Yeah. Who do you think? Robert. Oh, you think it's Robert? Get that f... off the monitor. For another example, watch Olivia Colman accidentally insult Jack Whitehall. An American accent. Yes. Yes. He's doing an American accent. What, in that clip? Yes. Olivia! He was. He was. Now, notice how Jack makes everyone laugh by leaning into the insult. It was good. Thank you very much. I've heard it. I've heard it. It was good. You see, what a lot of actors do when they do an American accent is they tend to just go for, like, one region of America and they commit to a single American accent. I decided with this role that I would take a sonata around all 50 states. Now, sometimes someone says something truly rude and you don't want to play along. In those cases, what can you do? Here's one option taken from Don Draper in Mad Men. May I join you? Yankee. Hey, go home. Are they making fun of me? A little bit. Being non-reactive can be a powerful response to an insult. You're implying that the person isn't important enough to bother you and your unshakeable confidence is unaffected. Another option is to call out their behavior. Specifically, their behavior, not the whole person. So, that was rude, not you're so rude. That was rude can make them reflect on what they said. You're so rude will just make them defensive. This won't work in cases of overt bullying because the bully isn't trying to hide their behavior. But it's great for situations where someone is trying to be rude covertly or rude in a professional setting. Let's stay away from the genetics and back to the brain scans. You cut that out now or you'll go home in an ambulance. Yeah, that seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion. A call-out draws attention to a person's social mistake. This puts pressure on them to take it back or double down and look bad. Here's an example of that from an Australian Senate session. You've restarted, fair enough. Let me just stop you so you don't waste a line of questioning. I'm just giving you... I love the mansplaining. I'm enjoying it. You're loving what? The mansplaining that's going on. What's mansplaining, Senator? Well, it's the slightly patronizing and condescending way that you're responding to my questions. Once he's established for everyone else there that she is being rude, he calls it out. I would suggest, Senator, that if you're putting the word man in front of some description of what I'm doing, you're doing that which I'm sure you're very much against. He's making a sexist implication. Now, sometimes a rude person simply isn't worth your time. In those situations, you can just walk away. He's like, okay, let's go for ice cream. All right. All right? So we get off the boat and he turns to me and he goes... First of all, you weren't like, all right. You were like, yeah! Good night, everybody. This is a fantastic response with people you don't plan to see again. For people who are regularly in your life, it can be a bit too reactive. In those situations, a better thing to do is draw a boundary and walk away if your boundary is violated. Here's a great example with Julian Assange. In this clip, he was told they'd be discussing evidence he found of potential war crimes by the US. Instead, the interviewer asks about personal allegations against him. He starts by calmly cutting her off and drawing a soft boundary. A soft boundary is one where you don't spell out the consequences for crossing it. If someone doesn't respect your soft line, follow up with a hard boundary. There's three things for you to take away from this example. Speak calmly, draw a clear boundary, and explain why the boundary is important to you. If you're going to contaminate us revealing the deaths of 104,000 people. When the interviewer continues to cross his boundary, he stays true to his word and he walks out. Now, to master any of the techniques in this video, it helps to have a strong foundation of self-confidence. Deep confidence makes it easy to genuinely find humor in being teased, so you can fire back with a smile or laugh along with the joke. And it makes it easy to draw boundaries and cut rude people from your life. If you want the fastest way I know to take your confidence and charisma to the next level, check out our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program that tells you exactly what to do every day, so that 30 days from now, you radiate confidence and charisma naturally, without even trying. Now, rather than tell you about it myself, here are a few things that past members have written us. Thank you so much for this program. After going through it, I've made more friends, have higher self-esteem, and can more easily talk to people I don't know. I am way more confident now, having gone through the daily action guides, and I can see a big difference in the attention and respect that I get. It makes life so much more fun. I don't think it's an overstatement to say charisma is literally a gateway to getting anything you want in life, so thank you for making Charisma University.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"George Clooney has a subtle and almost effortless charm and unlike some of the people that we've covered on this channel, you don't have to take drastic steps to emulate it. So today, we are going to be looking at some of the habits that make him so effortlessly charismatic and learn what you can do to convey that same charm in your life. The first thing that you can learn from George is that at the start of every social interaction, rather than focusing on what you say, focus primarily on setting the tone and pick the one that suits you best. Now to see this principle in action, let's begin by examining the most common start to any social situation — entering a room. First, have a look at this clip of a young Daniel Radcliffe making an entrance on stage. ... You'll notice that Daniel seems a bit nervous. His walk is rigid and he heads quickly towards Ellen without taking in the room or acknowledging the audience. Now contrast this to an older George Clooney while he enters David Letterman's stage. ... George feels much more relaxed. His pace is slower, he looks around smiling, and he lingers to greet the audience. That carefree attitude sets the tone from the start and frames the rest of the conversation. You'll also see George often spend more time to touch and warmly greet people when he enters a new space like here. ... All of these habits add up to one clear point. Whether you're walking into an interview, a workplace meeting, or a bar, for the first 10 to 20 seconds of any new interaction in a new place, rather than worrying about what to say next, focus on setting the tone. Now you can go really high energy like a Will Smith with huge gestures greeting everyone loudly or you can go for the more subdued Clooney charm by taking time to make yourself comfortable and then greeting others with a smile. Either way, the energy at the start of an interaction accounts for far more than the specific words you say so put your focus there. Now, if it's not already clear, the energy that George tends to create is one of comfort and this extends to how he situates himself physically. Just watch. So nice to see you, George. It's so nice to see you. Many wonderful things have happened in your life since the last time we saw you. Yeah. The reason that this is important to note is that physical comfort leads to psychological comfort and feeling comfortable is one of the main ingredients of charm. Even the simple act of crossing your legs if that makes you feel comfortable or resting your arms on the on chair combined with a relaxed posture can make you feel as if you were hanging out in your own living room as opposed to being under any sort of pressure like on a talk show or in an interview. Now, moving on to the next point, let's have a look at an easy way to make people laugh and enjoy your company without having to tell funnier jokes or even be much higher energy and that is laughing with your eyes. Watch how the interviewer here laughs incredibly easy at George's jokes and it's largely because he is priming her to do so by showing signs of laughter in his own eyes. In the same way that other people laughing can make you crack up for no apparent reason, seeing laughing eyes can do the same without you even realizing. Just watch. Have you ever been to Washington, D.C.? Yes. They are almost identical. They would say Washington is Hollywood for ugly people. It's like Hollywood with big marble props. And if you're worried about laughing at your own jokes, don't sweat it. When you have fun with your jokes, even to the point of laughing at them, it is very charming as long as the laughter is real and not forced. Here's a good example. Give me everything in the drawer. I was like, okay, and I walked away. He didn't show me a gun or a knife. The manager was like, did he hold you up? I was like, no, he just asked for the money in the drawer. I'm like, I'm not taking it. Let me make sure you have a gun. You're right. So the key here isn't simply to squint your eyes or put on a veneer of laughter behind your speech. It's to get emotionally involved with what you're saying and what is actually fun for you. And when you do this, your eyes will naturally go to that laughing look and people will match you making your charm effortless. And this brings us to another element where more genuine involvement in the things that you're saying is going to help and that is your eye contact. Now, there's a popular myth that more eye contact is simply better. And of course, if you're staring at your feet half the time, more eye contact would be an improvement. But George's style of speech illustrates that looking down while forming thoughts can actually make your communication feel more genuine. After all, there is a natural tendency to look down when you're accessing emotional memories. The key then is not to make unblinking eye contact but to be more like a boomerang making sure to return to the person you're speaking to after looking away so that they feel involved like here. I threw myself on the ground and it was a strike, you know, and everyone laughed. And I remember there was just a defining moment when I stood up and I looked at the guy and I realized I'll never hit an 85-mile, I'll never hit that. Now, in another video on Don Draper, we discussed that if you are giving more sporadic eye contact, the best time to deliver that is when you're making your most important point. And there's no hard and fast rule but George shows a way to handle this with humor and that's to make the punchline when you deliver that strong eye contact but then to break as people laugh so they don't feel too much pressure and you see him do this repeatedly. The African-American family moves into an all-white neighborhood and the mailman knocks on the door and says, this is Mrs. Myers here and she says, I'm Mrs. Myers. And he went door to door to tell everyone, have you seen your new neighbors? And by that evening, there were about 500 people on the lawn protesting and building a fence around the house. Some of your music for the new album and you're right on the beach and I was like, aren't you, don't you worry about somebody ripping you off? You're like, no, not at all. And somebody recorded from the beach, didn't they? Yeah. I could say something, go to sleep and wake up in the morning and my career would be over. It doesn't make sense to me that I would have that weapon available at any point. Now that last clip segues well into our next piece and it's George's self-deprecating nature. He does this all the time but what's perhaps most interesting here is that he does his self-deprecation more in some situations than in others and it connects to two seemingly opposite sides of his personality — his propensity to tease, prank, and laugh at people compared to his propensity to compliment people and to laugh at himself. Now the reason that these two opposing sides actually work so well together is that there's a pattern to the way George uses them. He's likely to be playful with people of a similar status — sometimes teasing them or laughing at them — but is often supportive and complimentary towards those that might have a lower status than him in any given social situation. So for instance, George will tease other celebrities of a similar stature like here. He's pricey. Matt's kind of — you know, he's on that slide on the way down now so we got him at a pretty good discount. He's also notorious for pulling pranks on his colleagues and here, he actually shows a picture of his naked crotch to Jimmy Kimmel on his show. What do you have? Well, I got a picture of my son. Aww. Oh, no. That's right. On the flip side, he regularly showers his interviewers who are less known in compliments. You look very dashy. Well, look at you. Before we get any further, can we talk about the green sweater? Can we bring it out? Yeah, what do you want to talk about? It's good. Is it weird? No, it's good and I'm telling you it looks great. Thank you very much. And he often delivers these compliments with self-deprecation, lowering his own position in a joking way. ...being defined as retro-futuristic. Would you want to explain? I don't know. You take your best shot. You're smarter than me. So consider whether you are punching up or down when it comes to teasing or laughing at people. At your level and above, and it's more likely to be fun for everyone involved as long as you're coming from a positive place. But if you're talking to someone who is lower than you in terms of status like a student who's in a younger grade or an employee who's underneath you in a business hierarchy or someone operating in a service role for you, generally, compliments are a much better way to go because you can come across as a bully without even meaning to if you're teasing due to your status. Now, this finally brings us to the mindset which ties all of this together. And it's that it doesn't appear that George's ultimate goal in conversation is to be charming nor should it be yours. It appears that his ultimate goal is simply to feel good and to make the other people around him feel good, too. Now, that's why he takes the time to settle in and it's why he has variable ways of treating people. Different things make people feel better depending on their status. Now, if you do this, you'll probably find that you are more willing to crack jokes at your own expense. You'll probably also find that you're quicker on your feet when things go wrong because it's just another opportunity to have fun. So instead of habitually asking yourself, what can I do to fit in or what do I have to say to make this conversation better, ask yourself instead, what would make both of us feel more comfortable right now or what would make both of us have more fun? If you do that, the charm will flow much more easily. If you're interested in the fastest way that I know to build both competence and charisma, I would recommend checking out our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step guided program that's guaranteed to give you more confidence and charisma in just 30 days. And it's structured with a daily action guide so that there's no guesswork when it comes to learning these habits. You just follow the guide and you get the results. Now, you can read all about the details in the link below but I figured the best way to let you know what this is all about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are just a few of the things that CU members have written in via email or the course comments. The first one comes from a guy who got promoted to a senior position early in his career and he says, I don't even have a bachelor diploma yet they want me to fill this position and when asked why, this was the answer. You have great social skills which is rare for an engineer. You can think quick on your feet and you are open and self-assured in your demeanor. Thank you so much for all that you've taught me. You have truly changed my life because without CU, I wouldn't have qualified for that position in a million lifetimes. Now, this next one comes from another person who started a new job saying, I wanted to let you know that I nailed those first days at work. Everything that I needed was right there at the right moment — the confidence, the energy, the smile, the positive mindset, and all with your tips from last Tuesday in mind, it could just not go wrong. And he finishes by saying, I just wanted to emphasize that what I did the previous days would not even have come to my mind if I had not discovered that charisma is a skill that can be learned thanks to your YouTube channel and university program. And this last one is a comment in the course from someone who used it mainly to improve their social and dating life and he says, In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Whether it's an interview, a first date, or just a conversation with someone you don't know well, we've all had times where things didn't go well because we were uncomfortable or nervous. That feeling sucks. So in today's video, we're going to go through some easy ways to look and feel more confident in those moments where you might have previously felt nervous. We'll do this by breaking down clips of Tom Holland. One reason Tom seems so charismatic is because of how he handles his mistakes in conversation. In situations where most people would shrink, Tom expands. For example, watch this clip of him playing a guessing game with Jake Gyllenhaal. Note if there's a moment when you smile or feel yourself liking Tom more. We're in London. We're going down the street to a funky beat. And I'm gonna get a haircut. Most people shrink when they make a mistake. They'll look down, hunch their shoulders to take up less space, or get quieter when they speak. In contrast, Tom actually gets louder and more expressive. Here's another quick example. Notice how Tom reacts after realizing he's messed up. Reacting like that when you accidentally say something stupid shows you're unfazed, which makes you look confident. Another trick you may have noticed, Tom also immediately calls himself out for his mistake. He doesn't try to hide it. If being loud feels unnatural to you, you can start with just a smile. Here's a clip where Tom isn't quite as high energy, but still calls out his mistake and finds humor in it. For context, at this point, it wasn't confirmed that there would be a Spider-Man sequel. When you misspeak and other people laugh, your body language is the difference between having a vibe of making people laugh or being laughed at. People cue into your body language so much that when giving contradictory words and body language, they will almost always trust what they see over what they hear. For a quick example, watch these two clips. Tom says he's nervous, but he still comes across as confident and likable. Tom says he's nervous, yet he's smiling, laughing, talking with his hands, and overall comes across great. So the question is, how can you carry yourself with a genuine positivity that feels natural when you're in a situation that normally would make you feel nervous? The trick is to cheat by using your mind-body connection. Research has shown that you can shift the way you feel simply by changing your body language. For example, imagine you're feeling nervous moments before a big event. Your heart is racing, your hands are shaking. It sounds silly, but you can shift that nervousness towards excitement simply by making yourself smile. Tom actually uses this exact trick. Now that said, a forced smile can make you look nervous or uncomfortable. So what do you do? Smile beforehand. Before an important phone call or in a car on the way to a date, throw on some happy music and plaster a smile on your face. It'll feel weird at first, but it'll put you in a better mood and kill some nerves. And obviously coming in with positive energy will help it go better too. There's a reason salespeople have been teaching smile before you dial for decades. But you won't always have the chance to prime yourself for nerve-wracking situations. Sometimes you're just put on the spot, like when you're asked a question and don't know how to respond. Most people fear awkward silences. So when they aren't sure how to respond to a question, they fill the silence with filler words like um or ah, which makes you seem nervous. But silence can be thoughtful rather than awkward. For example, watch Tom when Jimmy asks a potentially awkward question about how he pays his brother. Essentially, yeah. Does he ever come and say, hey, I'd like a raise? Maybe. Maybe. This is a super easy point, so we'll make it quick. When you pause to think about a question, look up and away rather than down. If you pause and look down, it can make you look uncomfortable. Then your discomfort can make other people feel uncomfortable around you. If you pause and look up and to the side, it just makes it seem like you're thinking without any feelings of awkwardness. Pausing before you answer a question can also help make your response funnier. You, uh, how old were you when you're in your first movie, the movie with Naomi Watts? I would have been about 13, 14. 13 or 14. Yeah. Did you ever at any time consider doing something else for a living? I didn't, but my parents did. Your parents did, yeah. If you want to learn more about the power of a pause in comedy, we'll link to our Dave Chappelle video at the end of this one. Another reason you get nervous when answering questions is that you're trying to give a right answer. You worry if you say the first true answer that pops into your head, you may embarrass yourself or be judged. This is especially true for embarrassing stories, which we'll touch on next, and for things that are potentially vulnerable. Many people incorrectly think that admitting vulnerable emotions shows weakness, so they lie or get defensive. This next clip is hilarious, but it's also not too far from how some people actually act. Are you crying? What's that? Are you crying? Am I crying? No, I'm not crying. You're crying. It's okay to cry. People cry. It's great, but I'm not crying. I'm not a crier. I don't cry. I work out. For some people, being vulnerable is hard. If you don't feel comfortable sharing vulnerable things about yourself, then you can steal a little trick from Tom. He actually used to have the same aversion to crying as Starsky. I went through a phase where I'd never cry about anything, and now I reckon I cry four times a week. I don't cry four times a week, but I cry a lot. Starts crying now. No, I don't cry that much. I cry, like, all the time. Tom bounces between sharing and joking, and every time he seems like he's backtracking, he doubles down. I think Bob said you cried on the phone. Is that true? I weeped. You — did you really? No, I didn't weep. I did, yeah. You did a little bit? Yeah. No, I was really emotional because I felt like it was all coming to an end. It was — it was bad news. It really was bad news. No, we — I don't know. You don't have to do this. There's nothing wrong with sharing without joking. But if it's not natural for you yet, then humor is a great first tool for charismatically sharing. Now, you may be asking, why is being vulnerable even charismatic? If you can admit vulnerable emotions with a positive attitude, you earn respect because you're sharing something many people would be scared to share. It also helps your internal confidence because you're training yourself to realize there's no emotion you have to hide or pretend you don't feel. Once you've mastered these tips, you no longer have to be afraid of being emotional, embarrassed, or awkward around others. Instead, you can use these past embarrassing moments as inspiration for charismatic storytelling. For example, listen to Tom share a story from shooting stunts in the most recent Spider-Man. So Zendaya would land, and I'm the superhero. I'm supposed to look cool. And she would land, and then I would sort of land like this, and my feet would swing from underneath me, and then she would catch me. And then you're like, cut! I'm like, oh, I'm not doing that. We've said it before, but telling embarrassing stories is a great way to showcase your own confidence. In our last video on Tom Holland, we mentioned a few tricks for this. Activate confident body language, choose high-impact words, and embody your characters. That last point is one we've made in several videos, but it can be intimidating. After all, if you're not a professional actor like Tom Holland, how can you act out all the characters in your stories? The easiest thing is to act out your past self. That should be easy since you're always acting like you anyway. The trick is to realize that the bumbling nervousness of the past can be the thing that makes you charismatic in the present. So just reenact your nerves. For example, watch how Tom shows the excitement and panic he felt when he met Robert Downey Jr. And I see Robert Downey Jr., I go up to him, I shake his hand, nice to meet you, and I'm starting to panic, right? I'm like, oh my god, it's Robert Downey Jr. And I'm looking at him in the face, sort of going, there's something different about you in person. Here's another example, this time with Tom acting out his nervousness from meeting Madonna. Now the whole way on the way over there, I'm going, what do I say? Hello, I had no idea what to say. So I get up there and I go, hello. You can make your story funnier simply by reenacting the emotions you were feeling at the time. And any emotion works, you don't have to limit yourself to just stories where you are nervous. For a quick example, in this next clip, Tom acts out excitement and then surprise. This girl walks into the scene, she's gorgeous, and she's walking over and I'm like, here you go, bro, here you go, here we go. And she breezes right past me, say hello, and she goes over to Sam and she goes, oh my god, are you Timothy Chalamet? And he was like, yes. That story is so much better because rather than just tell the story in past tense and third person, it's told in present tense and Tom acts out three different people in 15 seconds. And you can see the acting doesn't have to be Academy Award winning. Any attempt to change your body language or voice will make your story more interesting. Even a bad impression can make people laugh and love being around you if you commit to it. If that seems too over the top, don't worry. You can start by using the easiest type of emotion, a surprised pause. Someone comes up to me and they'll be like, oh my god, you're Spider-Man, hey. And I'm like, hello, how are you? And they go, you're English? They paired me with a kid called Arun and I was supposed to be his brother or something like that. And Arun is an Indian kid. And when I came in, everyone was like, really, your brother? And we're like, yeah, we're just distant brothers from, you know. But he called and he said, listen, you know, we want to workshop this like a real Broadway production. I'm like, cool, that's great. Then he's like, also, you might want to start working out because you have trapeze rehearsals when you get here and I want to use the sun double as little as possible. Now, there's one more thing I want to talk about in this video that doesn't tie directly to the title, but it's just a fantastic habit that Tom has that will help you be more charismatic and more liked. Tom casually defends the people in his life if someone tries to elevate him above them. So now you mentioned your brother. Is your brother here with you tonight? He's backstage, yeah, he's here. I met your brother last time he was here. Yes, you did, yeah. And I'm curious, as you know, I'm always curious as what the brother, because he works for you. Well, I really work for him if I'm honest. Remember when Jaden Smith fangirled so hard over meeting Tom Holland because I sometimes forget that this actually happened. I wouldn't say that he fangirled over me. I mean, I was as excited to meet him as he was to meet me. I've been a big fan of his for a long time. I love his music as well. Ironically, Tom's disinterest in making himself seem above his friends makes him look extremely confident in himself. Also, long term, the people in your life will love you if they know you have their backs when they aren't around. Now, whether you want to be confident because you're looking for a new mentor, more friends, or more dates, there's obviously a lot more to that than just what we've covered so far. You have to know how to start a conversation, how to hook them in the first few minutes so that they want to learn more about you, and then build a real connection so they want to see you again. If you want a step-by-step guide that lays out how to quickly master those skills, you may like our program Charisma University. It's the fastest way I know to become both confident and charismatic. You can read all the details in the link below, but I figure the strongest way to let you know what it's about is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few of the things that CU members have written in. This first one is from someone who says their social life has transformed. They wrote, I am significantly more confident in social situations. The connection I feel with strangers and close friends and family alike have dramatically increased. I transitioned from someone who never got asked to hang out regularly to multiple people texting me on a daily basis. Many people have openly expressed their admiration for me and I get a lot more positive attention. I've grown so much because of this course and I can't thank you enough. This next one comes from a guy who's been making new relationships. Before going through Charisma University, I didn't know how to bring energy to a group and I was terrible at meeting new people. Everything in my life has improved after CU from loving myself and others to creating and developing amazing external relationships. There's so much more joy in my life and CU has been a huge reason for it. And this last one comes from a guy who joined after a breakup. He says, Thank you so much for Charisma University. I thought after completing this course I'd become a smooth talker and be able to take over any room. What I didn't realize is I'd get that and feel so confident in myself. I feel liberated. Thank you for creating this course. If you want to join but you're not sure if it's right for you, you should know it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee. That means you can get a full refund for any reason at all. It's 60 days even though the course is only 30 days because we want to make sure that every single member truly feels like they're getting massive value from the course. If not, you can get your full investment back. If you want to learn more, go ahead and click the link on screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it and I would love for you to do the same. Either way, I really hope you enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one. Bye.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 890}}\n",

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"We've done several videos on this channel about how you can command respect through very subtle behavioral shifts but there's a flip side to this and it's that you can lose respect through very small behaviors and you're probably doing several of these today which is why, in this video, I want to talk about seven common behaviors that I see all the time that you're likely doing that are causing you to lose respect and what you can do instead so that you stop. So now the first one of these has to do with first impressions and it's when you just can't wait to share your achievements or your accolades in the first few minutes of conversation and this most often occurs when you want someone to like you. You're trying to impress them, right? It's somebody that you're interested in romantically or professionally, whatever. When I was in New York, I most often saw this in the form of receiving a business card as the first moment of conversation, right? Somebody would hand over a card and it invariably would say a really prestigious company and an interesting role because they wanted everyone to know that. If you're in entrepreneurism, perhaps people are talking about what they fundraise, how much their company sold, it can take many different forms but for you, ask yourself, do I constantly find myself talking about one particular prideful thing that I have, that I'm a musician, that I've earned money, that whatever it is for you in the first few minutes of conversation because if it's coming up all the time, chances are that you're shoehorning it in there. Now that's not to say that you shouldn't talk about these. You should absolutely talk about your values and the things that you're proud of but you want it to arise organically so first, connect with people, build some rapport, crack jokes, generate a feeling of trust, and then as conversation naturally, organically arrives at a place where they're asking you what it is that you're up to, then you can share it and they'll be genuinely interested and you won't alienate them. The second of these has to do with your attention so just ask yourself. Pretend that you're in a scenario where you're speaking to someone, you're in an interesting conversation, and somebody comes up and says something completely off-topic — how do you handle this? What I see a lot of people do, and I do this as well because we want to be inclusive, is immediately pivot to this person, answer their question, go back, and then somebody else says something and now you're in six different conversations. This is intended to be kind but what you communicate is that nobody here needs to respect my time and attention. You can interrupt me no matter what I'm talking about and I'll just pivot immediately. The people that I most respect have a way of handling this that is both kind and generates respect. When they're talking to someone and I've been the one interrupting with a completely off-topic comment, they don't flinch. And I stand here realizing that it was kind of rude of me to just try to interject into a pre-existing conversation. As they wrap up their thought which might occur in 10-15 seconds, they always then return to me and go, hey, you were saying something or they introduce me to the person and they pull me into that conversation and it makes me respect them more but also not feel excluded from the conversation. So doing that is going to be much better than simply trying to include everybody by answering every question immediately. Third of these also has to do with group conversations and it has to do with how you handle being interrupted in a singular conversation. Now, one of the things I grew up on the East Coast, right? Friends interrupt each other, it's not a mean thing to do but how you handle these interruptions, do you seed the floor immediately or do you at least finish your point? That is what generates or loses respect and even amongst friends who all love each other, there tends to be the case that there are some friends who are held in higher esteem and higher respect and some who are not. If you find yourself towards the bottom of that, this is one thing to change. So if you're speaking to someone, you're in conversation, and somebody interrupts you, cracks a joke, whatever, it doesn't mean that you can't seed the floor to them but at least finish your sentence strongly. It doesn't mean trail off going like, while this person takes over, it means finish that sentence in the same speed and the same volume that you were going to. When you arrive at a period, totally fine, that person can take over, your friends are allowed to do this in a non-mean way to one another without having to cut one another off and be rude about it but you definitely, definitely, definitely want to finish your sentence. It helps generate respect a ton. This fourth one has to do, again, these aren't things that bad people do, it's just something unfortunate that happens. I had a friend that I very much liked and one of the things that would happen is he would constantly talk about new business ideas and at first, it was really engaging because they were fun, interesting ideas to talk about but after weeks and months and dozens of these ideas that he was going to do, none of them happened so it meant that when he would come in to speak about one of these things, I would immediately tune out because I knew that what he was saying was so much hot air so if you lack follow-through, if you're talking about big plans for your future, places you're going to visit, businesses you're going to start, nothing wrong with that inherently but if you don't do it, you're training the people in your life to just tune you out so either shut those conversations down or even better, follow through on the bold plans that you're stating. It's going to make you a much more interesting person and maybe one of these great things will happen. You'll take a cool trip, you'll start a cool business. The fifth one, again, personal experience. I've been on both sides of many of these to be quite frank. The fifth one, I was at an event rather recently and there was a handful of people hanging out and someone entered the room that was moderately well-known. We all recognize this person. And a person in the conversation who had been there for 20 minutes prior to this and had been very quiet, disconnected, disengaged, immediately perked up and all of a sudden was so interested in this person, so eager to connect, so friendly, all of these other things and I know that it made me and everyone else who was in that table who had been there previously feel a little bit weird, a little bit grossed out by how try-hard this moment was and it was sub-communicated clearly to the person they were trying to connect with because they got out of there so fast. So if you find that you are changing your energy levels instantaneously when someone that you're attracted to enters a room or maybe it's a mentor, someone you'd like to do business with, if you find that that's completely variable depending on what you think you can get from someone in a conversation, that is going to lose respect. Now, naturally, there's going to be people that you're more interested in and less interested in and you're going to converse different amounts with all of them but a much better strategy is to keep a higher level of baseline enthusiasm and willingness to connect if you're out in public. It doesn't mean you need to have an hour conversation with everyone but the simple act of being friendly, engaged, not staring at your phone while you talk to one person and then locked in on another is going to make you come across as much less of a try-hard and a much more genuine person, quite frankly, because it is more genuine to do that. Now, 6.1, thankfully, it's not the most common of all of these but you might see it on Facebook. If you've been part of this, I forgive you but change it. It's when people start selling to their friends and family and you've seen it on Facebook, it's the MLM, it's the, you know, buy my fit tea, whatever the hot thing is today. They start monetizing their social network and you've probably been on the other end of a call from a family member or an acquaintance in high school who was trying to sell you on one of these things. Respect immediately goes out the window. Now, I am absolutely not anti-entrepreneurship but if you are starting any kind of business, I don't care if it's structured like a pyramid or whatever, you should be able to sell to a market that is people that you don't know because the product speaks for itself. If the first people that you're thinking of going to in any business venture are your family and friends, chances are that you're just converting those social links that you have into currency because if you didn't have the social link, they wouldn't be interested in buying and that's the case with a complete stranger. Totally fine if you have a business to sell to friends and family if they're interested but don't make that your primary source of income, revenue, whatever. I know this isn't most people but I had to include it because it's one of the biggest ways that acquaintances just drop off and plummet in respect and it's become much more common, unfortunately, with social media. So don't do this. The last one, the biggest, the most common, it's a catch-all, we've all done it, is lapses in honesty and integrity. This can take many forms but when people see you, go back on your word and it doesn't even have to be going back on your word to them. I've been in situations where I've seen someone who has cheated on their boyfriend or their girlfriend and immediately, the respect just plummets. If it's, again, the situation that I talked about earlier where you're talking about big things you're going to do when you're not following through, if you're hypocritical and you're judgmental of everybody who does a particular behavior and then when you're thrust into a situation, you do it, respect is just gone. So be very, very careful here with your word. When you follow through on this, it generates massive respect and, of course, the flip side is that in hard situations where you do the right thing but it's hard, everyone around who witnesses it has a massive amount of respect and it's where that cliched phrase, you know, oh, wow, I respect that even though they might not agree with it, comes from. So just keep this in mind, it's probably in 50% of my videos, do your best to be honest, do your best to remain in integrity. Now this last one, again, is massive but one of the things that can help support it is if you feel like you don't need to please everybody and part of that comes from having a stable foundation of self-love. Now I've done some videos on this in the past but one of the best primers that I can think of is a book by Kamal Ravikant that is called Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It and you can check it out today for free courtesy of this video's sponsor, Audible. Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It has a simple yet profound message about the importance of loving yourself and, of course, how to go about actually doing that and it makes an excellent audiobook since it takes on a sort of hypnotic quality where the lessons can really sink in so I highly recommend checking it out.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Avengers Endgame is finally here and one of the things that stands out most as I watch Infinity War clips in preparation is how much people love Thanos which is interesting given that not only do we see him kill indiscriminately throughout the film, his noble plan makes no sense at all but that is besides the point because this video isn't about plot holes. It's the real-life parallels that interest me because many people with dangerous personalities also have some highly attractive personality traits and while you don't have to adapt the murderous side of these dangerous personalities, you can learn quite a bit by taking pieces and adding them to your own charisma arsenal. So in this video, I want to explore three ways the dangerous personalities can actually be more attractive. Now the first charismatic habit of Thanos and people like him is non-reactivity. Avengers is an action movie so we expectedly see this in the face of physical threats. Thanos' non-reactivity shows just how powerful he is. But in other scenes, Thanos demonstrates non-reactivity in ways that are quite applicable to your own life. In this clip, Peter Quill shouts at Thanos and listen to the tone in which he responds. Let her go! Ah, the boyfriend. I like to think of myself more as a titan killing long-term booty call. Let her go. Peter. I'm going to blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face. Thanos comes in an energy level lower than Peter. Now fortunately, most of us will never have a space blaster pointed at us but his reaction is exactly what can diffuse a situation that begins to get hostile in real life and you can come across as exceptionally confident if you remain calm and keep the energy down. In his book, Never Split the Difference, Chris Voss recommends using what he calls the late night FM DJ voice. Now he's a hostage negotiator so he had to get the upper hand over people who were threatening violence and were clearly riled up so he'd speak to them like he was a late night disc jockey — deeper, smoother, calm. That technique allowed him to diffuse 10 situations and if you use it when people are being verbally aggressive with you, it's usually even better than a witty comeback though even better than that is both at the same time. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda — I know because I won both of them. The second habit that is both attractive and, in Thanos' case, highly dangerous is extreme conviction. Most people live their lives with a lot of self-doubt so we're drawn to those individuals who seem to be totally self-assured. We feel it most strongly in people who speak in certainties. For instance, notice that Thanos doesn't say what he would do. He doesn't talk about if he's successful. He states it as if his plan is 100% going to happen. And then what? I finally rest and watch the sunrise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive. I hope they remember you. In real life, healthy conviction doesn't even have to go that far. You don't have to believe that all of your plans will come true. Personally, I find firmly believing that I will be okay even if I fail no matter what to be the most realistic and open way to remain highly self-assured. Now when conviction goes beyond this towards certainty of what will happen, that a specific outcome will occur, you get someone like Conor McGregor who is astonishing in victory but also disappointing in his defeats. That radical certainty is probably one of the strongest mentalities that a fighter can have though. If you go beyond that, you enter into truly dangerous conviction where you assume that you know what is best not only for yourself but for others as well no matter what they say. And in this next scene, it's like Thanos can't even consider the possibility that he may have raised Gamora poorly. I'm not your daughter. Everything I hid about myself, he taught me. And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. So conviction is critical but you don't want it to the extent that Thanos has it. Other people need to weigh on your thoughts and if you're trying to develop healthy conviction, my recommendation is to simply focus on the belief, no matter what happens, I will be okay. When you can simultaneously embrace the possibility that you may fail in some specific endeavor but still feel worthy of love, respect, and even a second chance, that is a fantastic way to live. And if other people are telling you how to live and it's disrupting your self-assuredness, try this line out when speaking to them. You can say, it's a good thing that you get to decide what is best for you and I get to decide what is best for me because if it were reversed, we'd both be unhappy. Now, that brings us to the last point. Random and surprising acts of kindness can draw us closer to personalities that are otherwise not the fuzziest. For instance, after tricking her into thinking that she had killed him, completely toying with her emotions, Thanos offers Gamora some food. I thought you might be hungry. We see the same fluctuation between violence and kindness earlier with Gamora. After sentencing half of her people, including her mother, to death, Thanos has a kind moment with her. What's wrong, little one? My mother. Where is my mother? What's your name? Gamora. You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. You may have a friend who is in a relationship with someone like this. They're usually pretty terrible except on rare occasions when they surprise everyone with a kind gesture and that friend doesn't get out and just date a nice guy or a nice girl. Believe it or not, it's because infrequent and random acts of kindness are actually more attractive to individuals with a particular style of attachment called anxious or preoccupied. Those people often partner with what is called an avoidant type because they see themselves as unworthy so sporadic bursts of kindness make sense to them given their self-image. You may be in this kind of relationship if this song speaks to you. If you fall into the camp of these hot and cold relationships, the problem is that you have learned to value the intensity of the emotional connection over its quality. So the wild fluctuations between awful behavior and those bursts of kindness keep you wondering what you can do to bring out more of those rare bursts of kindness, ultimately staying with people who might be bad for you. The truth is that you need to work on yourself and I will probably go deeper into attachment theory in another video if it's interesting to you so just let me know in the comments. Anyway, when it comes to your own behavior, you shouldn't emulate Thanos' hot and cold evil style of behaving but you can recognize that the surprise recognition is very powerful for winning someone over. Now, the key is to make sure that it's not expected so flowers on Valentine's Day are nice but they earn you very little extra with your partner. Flowers one month later completely out of the blue are extremely powerful on the other hand. It's the same item timed differently to upset expectations. Similarly, it's fine and dandy to deliver a compliment when someone has dressed up for a special occasion — that's nice. But if you can offer compliments when they are least expected, their impact is magnified. Now, one thing that is worth pointing out here is that controlling personalities may use these variable rewards to make people with low self-esteem work even harder to win their affection. And I think Thanos illustrates this point. He creates a vicious cycle of reinforcing low self-esteem. You took me. I saved you. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. ...and then, all of a sudden, is randomly kind in order to motivate his daughters to work for his approval. Needless to say, don't do that. Be kind for the sake of being kind. In fact, right now might be a good time to surprise someone that you care about with a text or an email just letting them know that you are thinking about them and that you appreciate them.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Craig Ferguson has a reputation as one of the most fun, charming flirts in Hollywood. Some female celebrities would go on his show just for the chance to flirt with him. Yes, I heard you're a big flirt and I like flirting. I really didn't want to do any more talk shows, but my publicist sent me some tapes of you and then I developed a small crush. While Craig has clear advantages like being a famous TV host, a lot of what he does can be done by anybody who wants to be more attractive in conversation. Specifically, Craig has seven habits that can help you build chemistry with anyone. Learning just a few of these habits will let you go into any conversation with confidence, knowing people are going to love flirting with you. And if you end up with a talk show one day, you'll know your personality will get you reactions like this. Just want you to know, really, for real, I have about 25 girlfriends who are madly in love with you, who are really upset that I'm here and they're not. The first thing you'll notice about Craig is that he starts almost every conversation in a fun, positive way. Most people we interact with have boring conversation habits, so being around someone who makes us laugh and feel good is almost like a drug. We want to be around that person all the time. One way Craig does this is with a high-energy, enthusiastic compliment. You look sensational! I mean, sensational! Well, thank you! Look at you! Look at you, woman! You look sensational! Hello, Karen! Hello! How lovely to see you! How nice to see you, too! You look absolutely enchanting! The first thing to notice is Craig's word choice. Most people giving a compliment would just say, You look great. This is boring. By using more unique words like enchanting and sensational, your compliment is much more likely to light someone up. That said, a good flirty conversation doesn't have to start with a compliment. The second and more important piece of Craig's charm is his effusive, positive energy. In your own life, a good rule of thumb is to start a conversation with just a bit more energy than most people in a setting. So at a loud bar, that may mean being really big with your body language and voice, but in a coffee shop, it can be as subtle as a smile and speaking 20% louder than most people there. This is complimented well by Craig's second habit — over-the-top teasing. Have you ever been to Scotland? No, I'm— I have. I have. I'm sorry. Oh, wait, wait, wait! I forgot! You forgot my home land? What the hell? I went to Edinburgh. Nothing but compliments is boring. Nonstop teasing can make you seem like a jerk, but when you marry the two, you create a fun rollercoaster of emotion. If you're not quite sure how to tease someone while flirting, there are two easy teases you can steal from Craig. The first is asking a rhetorical question that assumes something absurd about her. Here's two quick examples. As a member of the non-tattooed community, I find tattoos fascinating. Really? Yeah. Are you interested in getting one? No. Really? Why? Why do you hate America? And you— can you drink coffee when you're pregnant? You can— I think you can have a cup. I don't drink coffee. Oh, you don't? It makes me crazy. How long have you been in Al-Qaeda? If you're going to do this, you want to make sure your question is obviously absurd, like being in Al-Qaeda. This makes it more likely to make her laugh, and it makes it clear that you're being playful, so you can be confident you won't come off like a jerk. Another easy tease is to call out when the person says something cliché. Here's an example of a cliché call-out. I have a gluten allergy, so I can't really eat— You have a gluten allergy? Yes. That's so unusual to hear from an actress. No, it's for real. No, for real, I'm not— If you tease someone with a cliché call-out, you're very likely to see them try to justify why they're different and not like the cliché. It creates a frame where they're basically trying to get you to like them or think they're unique. You saw that at the end of that last clip and here's another example of it again. I'm not really a vegan yet, but I'm working on it. Do you know how many girls I've heard say that? Uh-oh. No, but really? Okay. This type of teasing doesn't have the same absurdity shield, so reserve the cliché call-out for clichés that people won't be insecure about. Craig has another habit that makes his teasing well-received rather than hurtful. He'll call himself out as well. So you want a Mozart again then? Sorry, so you want a Mozart again then? Yeah. By teasing yourself as well as other people, you make it clear that it's not actually a critique and you're just saying whatever comes to mind that makes you laugh. If teasing intimidates you, you can start by focusing on something more foundational, the habit of being playfully absurd. Playfulness is a key part of flirting. In this next clip, notice how the joke doesn't just make her laugh, it immediately changes the tone of the conversation. Fries are from Belgium, aren't they? Yes, Belgium is everything bad for you. Fries, chocolate, waffles. Black tar heroin. Black tar heroin. Most people would have chimed in with something else Belgium is actually known for. It's a common mistake when flirting to think of the goal of the conversation as simply exchanging information. The reason teasing and being playfully absurd help build chemistry is because there's another goal when flirting, which is to create emotions. To be like Craig, you want to focus on creating a conversation that's fun and establish that you're more playful than most people. This helps tremendously with the thing Craig is probably most famous for. It's optional, but it's a huge part of Craig's attractive persona and the chemistry he creates with his guests. Craig creates an environment where people feel safe being flirty and sexual. Watch this clip of Joss Stone and you'll see even she's surprised at what she's willing to say after 20 minutes talking to Craig. It's Valentine's Day, so you can squirt whatever you want. No, you can't! No, you can't! Cream, berries. No! Anything goes. No, no, no. Why not? It wasn't me, it was her. Why do I say these things? It wasn't me, it was her. Clearly, she feels freer than normal and more willing to say inappropriate things just for fun. How does he do this? There's several ways. One is to go there first on your own with a joke that isn't about them. Here's an example of how Craig works sex into a conversation in a way that feels natural rather than creepy. She doesn't do that. Yeah, I like to talk about it. She punches you? Right in the face? Yeah, if I ask for it nicely. Craig probably could have gotten a similar laugh with a joke like she's small but she packs a wallop, but he specifically makes jokes about dating or sex to see if the other person jumps in and plays along. If they don't, no sweat. If they do, it becomes much easier for you to build sexual chemistry. That particular joke also implies that Craig is non-judgmental about kinks. That non-judgmentalness encourages the other person to feel comfortable joining in. Here's another example. Notice how casual his tone is. He asks it like he asks any other question. Like it's no big deal. And suddenly, they've gone from having a normal conversation to discussing what they like in the bedroom. That said, bringing up sex runs the risk of seeming creepy, so you'll have to calibrate. Another way to make this more likely to go well is to playfully misinterpret something so that she was the one who took the conversation sexual. Here are two quick examples. I like it. Yeah, me too. I had a lot of fun on the back of a horse. What are we talking about? I've got a really cool garden. Why wouldn't I dance in it? Do you garden? Do you have a compost heap? I do garden, but not as regularly as I would like. Are we still talking about gardening? Playfully misinterpreting something she says is sexual gives her the opportunity to talk about her dating or sex life. And because you used humor and framed it like she was the one hinting at it, if she doesn't want to talk about it, she can just laugh and move on without it creating any awkwardness. If joking about these things isn't something you feel comfortable with, you can still use this style of playful misinterpretation to make people laugh and like being around you. For instance, watch how Craig uses misinterpretation after asking if Yvonne surfs. I do a lot of adventurous things, but water is not one of my best friends. I'm not down with water. Really? What do you do when it's thirsty time? These platonic jokes are still good for building a connection because they make it fun to be around you. Another way that Craig creates a flirtatious vibe is with innuendo. He'll say something that's technically innocent but could have a double meaning. Watch here as he critiques Mila Kunis for her harmonica technique. Take your time. Take your time. Don't just rush in there blowing and sucking and chewing. Take your time. That's wildly inappropriate, except it isn't, which is why it gets such a big laugh from Mila. One thing with any of these misinterpretations or innuendos, you don't need to linger on them. Watch in this next clip how Craig makes it work together. She asked him if he ever loses his cool on set and he starts with an over-the-top compliment, then switches to an innuendo. Lost it on the show before? I lose it during the show. I'm losing it now. When I saw your shoes, I was like, I've lost it. I haven't lost it, I know where it is. You do? I've got a rough idea, yeah. Now watch how even though Moon is ready to play along, Craig's already moved on to something new. No, I don't know where it is. You are, that's a very interesting name, Moon. Thank you. Moon, what's your ancestry then? What's that? By not lingering, Craig shows he's flirty and inappropriate mostly to amuse himself, which makes him much more attractive. Once you see it's well-received, you can come back to it again with a different joke and stay on the topic for longer. With innuendo, misinterpretations, and absurdity, what you'll often see is that Craig will be the first person to make a joke sexual, but once he does, the other person is happy to join in and it's not just female guests he does this with. For example, watch this interaction with Chris Pine. You have harmonicas. Yeah, do you blow the mouth organ? Do you blow the mouth organ? How do you think I got this job? Teasing, absurdity, misinterpretation, innuendo, Craig does so much it can seem overwhelming. If none of these are habits for you already, you don't have to panic. Rather than try to master them all at once, pick whichever one seems the most fun to you and focus on building that habit first. So let's say you most enjoy Craig's absurdity. Next time you have a conversation with a stranger or even with a friend, focus on finding just one thing you can say that's playfully absurd. Make it a game for yourself. If you want to give yourself an edge in the game, watch 10 minutes of Craig videos before the conversation to prime your brain to be in that state. Purposely doing this several days in a row will make it easier and easier for you to do it without thinking. By starting in conversations with friends rather than beautiful women, you take the pressure off yourself and you make it easier for you to build the habit. This ties well with the next thing that lets Craig confidently flirt with anyone he's attracted to, which is that he flirts with the world. Craig's charming flirty personality isn't something he only turns on when talking to a woman he's interested in sexually. He flirts with every woman that's on the show and while he tones it down with men, he's still happy to use innuendo or even loudly compliment a man's looks. Hello, Craig. You look really nice. These looks... These look... Well, thank you. Flirting with the world helps you for a number of reasons. If a woman sees everyone around you laughing, it makes you more attractive. If you see someone you're attracted to, it'll be easier to approach them because you're already in an outgoing playful state. And if the way you interact with a woman you're attracted to matches the energy and playfulness you interact with everyone else, it's much more likely to feel natural and much less likely to seem creepy or try hard. That fear of seeming creepy is a big reason why many people feel nervous to flirt. To make sure you aren't seen as creepy, there's another habit you can steal from Craig — his leaned back body language. A common body language mistake that makes people uncomfortable is leaning in closely when you speak. Completely agnostic of any politics, this is the best example I could think of to show how leaning in can make someone uncomfortable. When you lean in like that, it can feel trapping, especially if you follow as they lean away to create space. By contrast, if you lean back, you make it clear that you aren't trapping them and you wouldn't follow if they chose to walk away. You still want to get comfortable with some level of physical touch if you want to build chemistry with someone, but that can be done with high fives, shoulder touches, or hugs. If you want to learn more about touch, we go into detail about it in our video How To Be Popular Without Trying, which we'll link to in the description. Craig has one more trick that lets him confidently flirt with anyone. He has purposefully gotten comfortable with his worst-case scenario. On a talk show, the worst thing that can happen is the conversation stalls into a long awkward pause. So what does Craig do? He purposely creates long awkward pauses. I want to do an awkward pause. Either consciously as training or just by thinking it's funny, he exposed himself to hundreds of awkward pauses way longer and more awkward than what we'd ever experience in conversation. So he has no reason to fear them. This doesn't mean you should go out of your way to make people uncomfortable, but that you should find harmless ways to expand your comfort zone. If you're watching this video, then you're probably interested in meeting someone. So one way to expand your comfort zone is simply to talk to more people. If you aren't sure what to say to start the conversation, two conversation starters you can go with are, Hey, I don't think I've met you yet. I'm Ben. Except say your name. Or if you want to take a page out of Craig's book, you can go with something like, Hey, I know this is totally random, but you're absolutely gorgeous. I'd be kicking myself for the rest of the day if I didn't come find out more about you. That said, if you want the fastest way to expanding your comfort zone and seriously leveling up your confidence, you should check out our 30-day program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step program for building your confidence and charisma as quickly as possible. Over 5,000 people have joined the program so far. Here's what just a few of them have had to say about it. First, life-changing. In six weeks, I went from being socially awkward with few friends to the life of every event I attend. I also went from having serious girl problems to dating the girl of my dreams. Charisma University transformed me from a lonely introvert hoping to better connect with people to an energy-filled extrovert who makes new friends everywhere I go. Another member wrote, My biggest breakthrough has been gaining more confidence. If you knew me a year ago, you'd see a socially awkward guy, but that same guy had hidden confidence and charisma that has now been unleashed. If you're reading this or listening right now, think about who you want to be in a year. This course will teach you how to be that person. And this last one comes from another guy who says CU helped his dating life. He says, Firstly, loving the course. I have cherry-picked a few things, for example, the filter lesson in the conversation module. This one lesson completely changed my life. I've liked a girl for a year now, but never thought much of it because I thought she was too pretty. Took your lessons, gave things a shot, and now we're dating.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Today, we are covering people-pleasing. Now, this is a very interesting topic for this channel because a lot of what we talk about is how to be charismatic, how to get people to like you. And if you don't know the difference, that can sound a lot like people-pleasing. So we're going to be talking about what genuine charisma is which we want and this people-pleasing stuff which we don't. So we're going to cover the subtle signs that you are likely doing in your own life, how to get rid of those signs, and the emotions that will be tells for each when you're doing it right and wrong. So to jump into it, there are three signs and three strong triggers that characterize people-pleasing. The first one is a mismatch. You're looking for a mismatch between what you are saying out loud to other people and the voice in your head. So if you find yourself saying, for instance, absolutely, no problem, don't mind at all, but the voice inside your head is going, oh my gosh, I don't want to do that. That guilt thing that you have coming up, strong sign that you are likely people-pleasing. Now, that's well and good when you can hear both of those voices clearly. The problem is sometimes, guilt, people-pleasing have become such a habit for people, at least in certain situations, that that internal voice is so quiet you can't even hear it. And these are some of the most amenable friendly people who think that exactly what they want is what everyone else wants and they don't realize they've just shut off their own internal voice. And despite how kind and friendly they are to everyone else, they don't have charisma. It's because they lack self-assuredness, it's because they lack conviction, and people can detect that. If you remember from our video on the five keys to charisma, one of those is self-assuredness, it's conviction, and if you are just being that tumbleweed for everybody else, you lack that and your charisma is shot. So the second thing that you want to pay attention for when we are talking about how to not be a people-pleaser is going to be looking for areas in your life where you are trying to get something without being explicit about it. Now, there's nothing wrong necessarily with having trades in your life, doing something for an outcome. The issue is when you have what are called covert contracts where you are doing something that on the surface is kind but you are really expecting something in return. You haven't said so and if you don't get it, you are going to be resentful. So maybe you are doing all these favors for your boss with the expectation that when review season comes around, it's time for promotion, you get that promotion. And you know for sure that you've done this if you haven't set up any sort of agreement but somebody breaks a rule that you haven't told them about and all of a sudden, you are resentful. The issue with this is that you are lacking in authenticity. All those nice things that you are doing, there's going to be a hundred tells that they are not genuine in and of themselves. There's something that you want out of it. If you look on Reddit, the subreddit Nice Guys, people who turn from gentlemen to complete cruel people in the span of a text message, this is an exact caricature of this thing so you don't want to do this. It destroys your authenticity and thereby, your charisma. The third thing that you're looking for is a difference in behavior between groups. Genuine personality traits will be fairly consistent across groups. If you are a certain way, you will tend to be that way with waiters and waitresses and taxi drivers all the way up to CEOs and people that you're attracted to. Now sometimes, nervousness can get in the way but that's going to be the mode that you go back to. When you are in that people-pleasing mode, you're breaking out of that. Your enthusiasm, your energy levels are wildly shifting depending on who enters the room. So the boss enters the room and you went from being the most boring dull person to all of a sudden, you're on top of it, you're eager, you're engaged, you've got really interesting questions, he leaves, and with your colleagues, you're shut off. Or that attractive person comes in the room, same sort of thing. Now you're cracking jokes, you're the funniest person but they leave and then you're just dull. So this is a fantastic sign that you are faking it. The problem is that enthusiasm, that wild shift is detectable. Even to that person who hasn't seen you at your low, they can tell that there's this startup going in that you are trying to put it on for them and that destroys your charisma. So now the natural question is, okay, so here's things that you might be doing. Maybe you know that there's a person in your life or a group of people you're doing it with. How do you get back to genuine charisma which would make people like you but not just be a pushover who is doing what everybody else says? How do you be kind without trying to make people like you? So here's three things that you can do. First, get back in touch with that internal voice. This can be tough to do if you have a habit of being a people pleaser but one fantastic question that you can ask yourself is pick a person that triggers this someone that you might be doing this with and ask yourself, if I knew that beyond a shadow of a doubt, this person would handle it beautifully, I would fill in the blank. So if I knew that my boss would handle it beautifully, I'd stop laughing at all of his dumb jokes or if I knew that everyone in my life would handle it beautifully, one thing that's come up for me, there's a lot of people that are asking to stay at my house right around the same time, I've said, yes, I've started to feel stressed and resentful and frustrated. If I knew they'd all handle it beautifully, I would ask them to get a hotel instead. That first step is about being internally honest. It brings back your self-assuredness and your conviction but it's not the same as step two which is how you express that because the problem with people pleasing is that it is often black and white. We think, if I do not, in my case, for instance, let everyone stay at my house the entire time then there will be a problem, they won't like me, they'll be frustrated with me, whatever it is. Oftentimes, in the real world, there is a third option that works and as I went through this kind of with myself, I realized, you know what? It's not that no one can stay with me, it's that I don't want this many people for this long so if my mom, for instance, who is coming instead got a hotel for a couple of nights that would make me feel much better and it's not like everyone else is shelling out a ton of money because I don't want to share my space. That is a way to find that third option that is going to be expressed. Honestly, it's slightly different from the first one which is like, I want everyone to get away and that is a way that you can come to a genuine, not compromise, but a realistic thing that is going to work for other people while still protecting your own boundaries. Now the third piece is going to be going forward. You want to pay attention to the personality traits and ways of being that you feel like you can do consistently across groups of people and if you don't feel like you can, you are likely staying in that people-pleasing mode. This is the subtle difference between personal development and people-pleasing. If you feel like you can only be fun and funny with people that you know that you want to like you, members of the opposite sex that you are attracted to that you want to like you back, that's people-pleasing. But if you go, you know what, it is fun for me to be more engaged and enthusiastic with everyone around me even when I'm just in line trying to get some food or even if I'm in my Uber talking to the driver, that has become a personality trait. You're no longer trying to get something from every individual, you are instead enjoying that state in and of itself which is beneficial to the people around you. Another thing that I have found that I like to do, I like to work through problems. So independent of who it is in my life whether it's my mom, my dad, friends, someone that I'm dating, someone that I just have gotten to know very, very recently, if they have an issue in a social situation in their life, I like to hear about it, I like to help with it. That is a consistent thing that I do and I'm not expecting them to owe me anything at the end of it. So really get in touch — what ways can you grow and what ways can you give that are consistent amongst groups? So I hope that you have found this useful, I hope that you start to put an end to your people-pleasing. If you are interested in learning how to make an authentic amazing first impression, we have a video that can help you with that. It covers the four emotions that everyone feels every time that someone has made an amazing first impression on them. If you begin to understand what these are, you can do it in a genuine way and not in this people-pleasing mode. So if you would like to go ahead, check that video out, you can click the link in the description below or the one on screen now. Either way, I hope that you have enjoyed this video.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Today you'll learn the art of persuasion, specifically seven powerful principles that influence everyone's decision making, including your own. You'll learn ethical ways you can apply these principles and, just by being aware of them, you'll now notice when someone uses them on you. I want to credit Robert Cialdini's book Influence for first teaching me these. One of the strongest principles of persuasion you need to be aware of is social proof. People will look to other people to help them decide how valuable something or someone is. For an example, watch what happens when this YouTuber hires 25 paparazzi to photograph him in the street. With photographers swarming him, it's totally reasonable to assume he's famous. But why are people waiting in line for selfies when they don't actually know who he is? They only want it because they see that other people want it. Now, of course, social proof does have its limits. For example, listen to how this YouTuber tried to trick a comedy club owner. This might trick a random audience member into laughing, but when someone's full-time job is to evaluate talent, they're not going to suddenly think you're funny just because other people are laughing at your jokes, right? There's a lot we can take away from this. First, recognize that other people can literally warp how you experience someone. This is something you have to be aware of if you're in a closed social system like school or an office. Otherwise, you might end up pursuing a friendship or relationship with someone who you don't even like just because other people like them. Or you might end up blowing off someone amazing just because other people don't feel the same way. The other thing social proof can teach us is how other people view us. This next clip is a fictional example, but it's a pretty accurate representation of how many people think. Does this mean you should pick your friends based on how it'll make other people react to you? No, of course not. But there are a few ways you can improve your life now that you know about social proof. First, if you like to go out to meet new people, don't stalk around the venue not talking to anyone looking for someone you're attracted to. Instead, focus on having fun and talking to everyone around you. You'll have a better time, and when people see you bouncing between groups making them laugh and have a good time, you become magnetic. Social proof can also be used if you're recruiting for a new job. Let's say your dream job is to work at Google. Apply to a few competitors at the same time. If you get offers, you can tell Google that you really want to work there, it's your dream job, but just as a heads up, you have a few other job offers already that you need to get back to. Most recruiters will suddenly view you as a more attractive candidate. In addition to social proof, this also triggers our next principle of influence, scarcity. People have an innate fear of missing out and regretting it. So when something is perceived as rare or in short supply, its value increases in our eyes. In that recruiting example, you become a more attractive candidate because they might not be able to get you. To avoid falling victim to this trap yourself, start identifying scarcity speech. Almost sold out, limited time only. These phrases trigger the fear of missing out and regretting it. That's why salesmen will often lie about scarcity to persuade you to buy something. More than any other factor in today's video, this scarcity principle should trigger flashing red warning signs in your mind. Nothing will separate you from your money faster than scarcity. One particular type of scarcity to be wary of is time scarcity. Act right now or this incredible opportunity will pass you by. This is one of the ways that pump and dump scammer Jordan Belfort was able to get complete strangers to invest millions with him in stocks they knew nothing about. The example we're about to watch is from a fictional movie, but DiCaprio worked with the real Jordan Belfort to make sure scenes like this were authentic. Scarcity is so effective, people add it to situations that don't have it. Like artificially limiting how many people can join a completely automated online course. Or worse, lying and saying seats are capped to create a buying frenzy and then selling way more than the cap they claimed they had. People manipulate the scarcity principle in personal relationships too. Like when first dating, they'll purposefully not text you back for hours or days. It makes you feel like they're in high demand and their attention is scarce, which can unfortunately make you start to want it more. The third principle of influence we'll cover today is consistency. People rarely like admitting they were wrong, so they feel pressure to be consistent with the things they've said or done in the past. The most viral example of persuasive consistency comes from Jordan Peterson's conversation with Kathy Newman after Kathy asks him this. For context, this conversation has been contentious, with Kathy aggressively trying to poke holes in many of Jordan's ideas. And that's great news for him, because it's exactly what allows him to persuade Kathy to share his viewpoint here. What can she do here? She either has to say that she's been behaving poorly for the last 20 minutes, or stay consistent with her past behavior and say that she agrees with it. Before you try to change someone's mind, see if you can show them that based on their past actions, you two already agree. You can also use the consistency principle by giving someone a reputation they want to live up to. They'll try to act consistent with how you see them, because it's how they want to be seen. In this next clip, watch how Saul persuades Tuco not to kill his associates. It's a fictional show, but the psychology of this clip is real. There's two key elements to giving someone a reputation to live up to. First, the person has to want that reputation. Second, they have to be able to believe that reputation. In that last clip, if Saul had said, Tuco, don't do this, you're not a murderer, it wouldn't work. The next principle of influence is reciprocity. People are more likely to say yes to a request if they've previously received a favor or gift from the other person. This can be a great thing. A friend helps you move, later you help them move, and you're both better off than if you had moved yourself alone. The danger comes when someone gives you something to purposefully trigger your sense of reciprocity, and then asks for a bigger favor now that you feel obligated to say yes. This next clip is a funny example from The Office. It's over-exaggerated, but it gives you a good idea of what to watch out for. There's another sneaky way reciprocity can show up in your life, and that's during a negotiation or a disagreement. A person might make an extreme request, knowing you'll reject it, and then fall back to a smaller request. You think they're doing you a favor by conceding, so you feel compelled to accept the new offer. Cialdini calls this the rejection-then-retreat technique. This is a good trick to know about so that you can defend yourself from it. Don't feel obligated to meet in the middle. It's okay to stand your ground if you think your position is fair. On the flip side, this isn't a trick I'd recommend you try. If your first request is seen as a lowball or an obvious trick, the person will hate you for trying to manipulate them. You're much better off making sure that each suggestion you make in a negotiation is reasonable and made in good faith. Now, one thing that makes all of these principles more persuasive is authority. People have a natural instinct to listen to those who seem credible or who they view as experts. While this is generally a good instinct to follow, it can be easily abused, especially when people use symbols of authority like titles, credentials, or a uniform to trick people. For another example, listen to how the shoe brand Payless pranked designer shoe buyers by using symbols of authority to make their store look like a high-end fashion store. Then they told people this was the grand opening of an Italian designer, and with all the trappings of a designer shoe store around them, look how people reacted to the Payless shoes. The danger of authority's persuasiveness goes beyond pranks and scams, because even when someone is actually an authority on something, blindly trusting them can still be dangerous. Super successful business people can still give bad business advice, and a real doctor can still give bad medical advice. This doesn't mean you need to question every authority you encounter, but if you're about to make a life-changing decision based on another person's expert advice, there's two things you can do to protect yourself from bad-faith actors. First, trace financial incentives. Does this authority figure benefit financially if you follow their advice? This doesn't automatically mean it's bad advice, but it's worth being aware of. And second, always seek a second opinion if you can. Now on to principle number six, liking. If you're a fan of Charisma on Command, you probably already understand this one. People are more easily persuaded by people they like. If you're charismatic, life is easier. You're more likely to get friends, dates, job offers, promotions, just to name a few. How to be likable is a topic that needs more than a minute to teach, but if it's an area you want to improve, just check out any other video on this YouTube channel or our online Charisma University. Now there's one more persuasion principle that I want to cover that Cialdini doesn't cover in his book, but it's incredibly persuasive. Risk mitigation. People are loss-averse. We fear getting ripped off, wasting our time, basically making any big decision and regretting it. So if you're trying to persuade someone to do something, think of what they think their potential downside might be to saying yes. Then offer them a way to minimize that downside. Here's an example from the real Jordan Belfort closing a sale. I'm asking to get married right now, okay? I believe in starting small because I know I can prove myself to you. Now if I was here saying to you, I want all your business fire tight and do this, do that, right? You'd say get the f*** out of here, right? Okay, but I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that I'm confident if you just see a little bit of what I could do, we can use that as a benchmark to go forward. So again, I'm asking for one shot, 30 days, and believe me, you're going to be inclined for life. Okay, now there's one last point on persuasion that is by far the most important point in this entire video. It's not a persuasion principle, it's a mindset that will make everything in your life easier and more successful. I'll let Jordan explain this one too. It's a lesson he learned after going to prison. Here's a pen. In the movie, we see Jordan Belfort sell a pen. Sell me the pen. So the best thing to say is I would say to Pierce, how long have you been in the market for a pen? Uh, I wanted a pen for three months. If you would have said to me, I don't really use a pen. I said, oh really? Will you be in the market for a pen at all the next few weeks or so? You'd say, no, I said, have a nice day. I'm going to go find someone who wants a pen. I don't want to sell someone a pen who doesn't need a pen. Don't spend time trying to persuade someone to do something unless you genuinely believe it's good for them. One, it's unethical and two, even from a purely selfish standpoint, it's bad for you. Even if you get what you want, they'll come to resent you for talking them into a bad decision. They won't want to be in a relationship with you or to do business with you again, and they'll warn other people to stay away. On the other hand, if you use the principles in this video only to persuade people into things that are genuinely good for them, then each persuasion will make the person like you more and trust you more. You're building up a bank of goodwill and strengthening your relationship. For a practical example of how some of these principles can be combined, let's take a look at our Charisma University program. For consistency, if you watch our videos, it's safe to assume that you're interested in becoming more confident and more charismatic. With a time commitment of just 30 minutes a day and running just 30 days long, Charisma University is by far the fastest way that I know of for you to actually become more charismatic. For social proof, if you look at our checkout page, you'll see we show thousands of people have gone through the program, we show that the average review is 9 out of 10, and we show individual testimonials so you can see some success stories from our past clients. For liking and authority, we rely on the quality of our videos. If you find our free content helpful, you're much more likely to have confidence that our Charisma University will change your life. And probably our strongest persuasion tool is our 60-day money back guarantee, because it makes joining the course risk-free. Charisma University is 30 days so you can take the entire thing and see if it changes your life. You either think the investment was worth it, or you get all your money back. So the only way you end up out money is if you feel that the charismatic habits you've built will meaningfully change your life. We're confident they will, which is why we offer the guarantee.

      "[RIZZBOT] Transcript raw: {'text': \"Aubrey Plaza is pretty well known for her awkward moments. What is the wizard? You see, you're drinking my water. That could be the bad. But despite and even because of her awkwardness, she is extremely popular, successful, and attractive to many people which is why, in this video, we're going to break down how to turn your awkward moments into ones that actually make people more drawn to you. And I'm not saying that everything Aubrey does is something you want to copy but you can learn a ton from her approach. So to begin with, it helps to understand what causes awkwardness in the first place. One way that you can unintentionally cause an awkward situation is by not knowing and then not following social protocols in any given situation. For instance, giving a one-word answer to an icebreaker. Thanks for being here. Yep. No. No, yep is not the correct response. To be clear, there isn't a hard and fast rule that says you need to say, Thanks for having me. In fact, as long as you display positivity and enthusiasm, you'll do fine in any sort of greeting. There's not one specific thing to say but one thing that you should really do and it's one thing that I saw Aubrey miss early in her career is shake people's hands or make some kind of physical contact in the greeting otherwise, awkward things like this can happen. Now, if you mess any of this up for whatever reason — you stumble on your words, you miss a handshake — the best thing to do is a key principle of turning awkwardness into attraction and that is to call it out. Discomfort balloons when everyone knows that something is awkward but no one acknowledges it and the person who does call out an awkward moment gets points for having the guts to do so so allow yourself to lean into the awkwardness for a moment like this. Yes! That was awful. We started to turn into a high-five and it just fell apart. Conan kind of teases PewDiePie here but I generally recommend that you don't make it the other person's fault when you're calling out awkward moments and this is actually something that Aubrey does very well. Whatever bit of awkwardness occurs, you can act like it was planned in a joking matter and this is what she does in this next clip when the music runs long at an acceptance speech. Hi. Thank you. This is... Thank you. That's my theme song. Now, calling a situation out can define you as a leader in a group but if you want to take the extra step and really make people laugh from an awkward moment, you can call out that situation and then lean into it even further. Now, Aubrey demonstrates that idea in this next clip as the camera lingers too long on her inner thigh. She runs with this joke. Stop it. You're getting me all hot and bothered. Oh, my goodness. Okay, so I'm putting that right up to BiteStrokers.com. Yeah, I'll stroke my bite any day for you, Conan. Now, there is one category that I want to bring up in particular and that is when someone makes a social mistake. I don't mean that you're going around fact-checking people politically or scientifically but when someone calls you by the wrong name or has a piece of food on their face or says, nice to meet you when you've met before, you definitely, definitely want to call these moments out. These are the ones that the awkwardness can get out of control if you don't say something early. And that brings us to the next group of things that can become awkward that we want to turn around and that is when you give short answers as people are trying to make small talk with you. For instance, someone says, how are you? You respond, good. Or they say, what did you do this weekend? You simply say, not much, and conversation dies there. Or... Are you from originally? I'm from Wilmington, Delaware. Wilmington, Delaware. I don't know many people from Delaware. Thank you. Yeah. Now, if you're not on television, you're not going to have a David Letterman to laugh it off and push the conversation forward. In fact, it might die right there and you've probably experienced something like that. And that's why as Aubrey has gone later into her career, you can see her answer these basic warm-up small talk questions and then add something that the question reminds her of. That extra sentence carries the conversation and is an excellent habit to get into generally. Now, really, as a little kid, did you really think that plazas were named after you? I mean, no, but I do remember as a child one of the first lies I think that I ever told was like I told a bunch of people in my class at the Plaza Hotel that my dad owned it or something. And that takes us to the third cause of awkwardness which is not having appropriate expressions to give your words context. When people don't know what emotional response is appropriate in any given situation, they sometimes just freeze and they feel awkward which can make you feel awkward and then the whole thing spirals out of control. This is why we look to someone's emotional expression as much as we listen to their words when we're paying attention to them. Those awkward moments occur when your delivery is flat and the appropriate emotional response can become ambiguous like here. I recently laughed so hard that I threw up. Now, you have a few options to make these sort of situations turn from awkward to more attractive. First off, if you're going with that more deadpan delivery, know that this actually works best when what you're saying is so over-the-top strange that the juxtaposition between your delivery and your words is undeniably humorous like in this clip. Are you having a good summer so far? Yes, so many penises. ... If other people aren't picking up on your more deadpan style of humor, there is a time to break and simply laugh at yourself which clues all the other people in and saves the joke from just becoming weird. I caught myself yesterday singing a song out loud that goes, kill, kill, kill, die, die, die. ... But in the worst-case scenario, when the crowd is not getting the emotional response that you're going for, you can just pause and explain yourself. Again, this is following the theme from the first tip which is that awkwardness is compounded when it goes unrecognized and unspoken but when you have the social savviness and the confidence to just bring it up, it can dissipate quickly. I recently laughed so hard that I threw up and I'll tell you why because I was in an umami burger. Now, the next type of awkwardness is maybe one of the most common and this is one that you'll want to turn around when you don't know what to do in a conversation. We've all had that moment where you can't think of what to say and it leads to an awkward silence or worse, ends the conversation entirely. If you do run into this and you don't know how to respond to a question, straining to keep that trailing conversation going could be even more awkward and instead, what you can do is something so awkward that it actually saves the conversation — the hard pivot. You just take the conversation in a brand new direction or drop something completely random in to lighten the mood like this. What was that look about? I just offered to save your life by flying and you did it. No, I felt terrible now. No, marry me. Do you say chimpanzee or chimpanzee? Fork. I like that. We haven't done that before. Wanna see my socks? Now, in my opinion, the best of these hard pivots is the first one — marry me and that's because the joke has a positive subtext towards Conan. So when you're flat out of things to say and you introduce one of these hard pivots, keep in mind that the more positive the subtext, the more likely it is to be laughed at and accepted by whoever you're speaking to. Now, I have definitely been a bit random in covering these awkward moments because it can come up in so many different kinds of scenarios but there is a common thread that ties all of these things together and as always, this most important piece comes down to a mindset. With Aubrey in particular, she isn't trying to do what she is supposed to do in any of these situations. She's not micromanaging what people think of her. Yeah, I try to have fun with it and not take it too seriously because the minute that I really get wrapped up in that and think, like, this is what I need to say or whatever, it's over. This is the great paradox of self-improvement as it relates to confidence, charisma, and attraction. On the one hand, there are concrete things that you can do to be more likable and comfortable in social scenarios. On the other hand, overloading yourself with what you should do is no fun at all and it's going to make you come across as stiff and robotic. So the best advice for using this channel is worth repeating now and it's to pick just one thing to focus on at a time. Maybe it's adding another sentence after the small talk. Maybe it's playing around with some hard pivots. Let that be the one habit that you develop while for everything else, just be as you are today and that might mean that you say random vulnerable things. And I've been really hormonal lately. Or it might mean that you joke around about your own insecurities. Do I look cool? You look awesome. Sweet. But weirdly enough, when you allow these moments to just happen naturally, you don't try to fix all of them. You tap into the same core of Aubrey's appeal which is that she isn't putting on airs and in the long term, it's that comfort with your own awkwardness that winds up turning it into something attractive. You're the most fascinating person I've talked to in a long time. I'm serious. This is really good stuff. If you want to know the most important habit to focus on every single day so that you quickly build both confidence and charisma, I would recommend checking out our program, Charisma University. It's a step-by-step online course that is guaranteed to give you more confidence and charisma in just 30 days and it's structured with a daily action guide so that you're not guessing when it comes to which habits you need to learn first or the orders to go after. You just follow the guide and you will get the best charisma results that I've ever seen. Now, you can read all about the details inside in the link below but I figured the best way to let you know about what the course is is just to let the members speak for themselves. So here are a few things that CU members have written in via email or the course comments. The first one comes from a woman who has seen changes in her relationships with family and with friends and she says, Hey, Charlie. Just wanted to let you know how awesome this course has been for me so far. For the first time in my life, I feel like everyone around me cared about what I was saying. It seemed like everyone listened to me and responded really well to my jokes and to the serious things as well. I didn't really think I would like being in the center but I loved it. Thanks so much for sharing your knowledge with all of us. It's been really life-changing so far. The next one comes from a woman who used to you to get a new job and she says, I would like to reach out and thank you and your team at Charisma University. Long story short, thanks to my new mindset and attitude, I was able to successfully get into a 16-week IT program. Among the hundred people that applied, I was one of the 17 students that got accepted. I connected with over 60 IT professionals and I'm building my network to land an internship. I didn't even notice I was doing all of this until one of my classmates commented on how good I am at networking. The feeling of realizing how much I've changed and where that has gotten me is absolutely phenomenal. I am so happy and so thankful to you and Charisma on Command. It truly changed my life and I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Now, the last one comes from a guy who joined Charisma University last year and saw changes across the board in his life. He says, hi, Charlie. I wanted to thank you for all your great content. I've actually read some books on this stuff but your videos are by far the most valuable. My job has improved, my outlook with women has improved, I actually met my wife by being more confident, and my life in general is in a better place. This stuff really works and there's so many more success stories just like those in the comments if you decide to join the course. If you do join, it comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee which is 100% for any reason at all. And I hate those courses that make you jump through hoops. We make sure not to do that. We also make sure that it is 60 days even though the course is only 30 because I want to make sure that every single person is actually getting a ton of value from the course. If you're not, you can just refund. So if you want to check the course out, go ahead, click the link on the screen now or below in the description. We've had thousands of members go through this course and get a ton out of it and I would love for you to do the same. Either way, I hope that you've enjoyed this video and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.\", 'logprobs': None, 'usage': {'type': 'duration', 'seconds': 723}}\n",
